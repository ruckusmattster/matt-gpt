It's more noticeable in game
Yeh that's the one
all good, its changed now
i dont have the permission to change my nickname, could you just change it to ''matt''
no rush ü´°
the link i sent is a photoshop upscale but ive got the original more pixelated
yes please
eh it came out very rainbow-y
aw cool
could someone lend me a hand, ive been out the AI game for a while and just need one image upscaled, would someone run this through whatever upscaler 
so they both had a bit of a leg up
both are variations on the same base img
take a look at my small comparison
it really is an improvement
L
same
its completely down now i think
i see üòÖ
how whats done?
<@379653649783193602>
what resolution?
prompt "detailed, intricate etc" cfg:max   denoising:0.1   steps:100-150
or in img2img you can use the SD upscale script
in the extras tab, my favourites are foolhardyremacri which has to be downloaded separately or LDSR
get sponsor block for skiping adverts within a video
is there a subnautica TI or DB or HN?
berry mix and protogen are my gotos
what outputs are you getting now?
could someone run a gigapixel upscale for me?
‚ù§Ô∏è Oh beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞ thank you so much
im thinking a hogh batch size
i got this far but my next 2x upscale is estimated 4 hours
im tryna get it to be huuuger
forgot that runs locally
ah rip
can someone run a photo through gigapixel for me
would someone point me towards the best place to train the AI on images of myself anywhere online
ignore it for the most part
how many tokens youve used
math says 1089 px/mb
so <@190711020006670336> you should hit 16,689,085 pixels
or a total of 64 512x but clearly its not linear if youve just hit 72 without using all your vram
<@190711020006670336> how much vram do you have in generation data
not bad
so over 512x512 thats 50 images
<@244076580069048320> some matsh says you should be able to hit 13116274 pixels in one batch
also how much vram does it say is reserved
<@244076580069048320> try a 47
7gb --> 30 img
11gb --> ???  (maths says 47)
<:waow:1017853838516035725>
what gpu? im maxed at 30
ahhhh
was that multiple 1024
surely 1024x1024 < 1920x1080
i dont think its linear, ive done native 1080p but can only do 32x 512 at once
100 images in 4 minutes aint bad
it works quite well eh
30???
28 worked
and im not complaining üòÖ
idk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it just goes
512x512
26
3060ti* its got 8gb
ive managed to get native 1920x1080 generations off of it
lemme see, only tried up to 25 at once
yup, want me to get a screen record real quick
in the ui config you can set it infinitely high, you change the step sizes too
one sec
batch size is for multiple in parallel
yeah batch size not count
i can get 25 in one batch on 3060ti
i keep all those in quicksettings
sd_model_checkpoint, inpainting_mask_weight, ldsr_steps
np
anyways im off to bed, ill be up a lil longer so @me if you got a question and ill try reply but i wont be able to use SD
if you want you can try getting  a better colour match on the hair with the colour dropper tool in mspaint and just extending the hair
should be
ah its a SD image
what show or brand is the image from?
if youre in automatic1111 drag and drop my img into the png info tab and select send to inpaint
alr, tldr i did some manual painting. i also upscaled it 2x before ipainting just cause
close?
nearly, one sec
how are you trying to change his hair?
yup
nah sorry
im abt to go to bed but lemme take a stab at it
send over the original image + prompt
and try copy the settings i screenshotted above
cfg scale under 9
denoise around 0.4-0.6
personally: loopback off
hence the funky pattern
youve selected latent noise, which the tooltip says will just replcae the maasked with random noise
take a look at these two
screenshot your settings
deforum error? not sure why
have you tried the auto installer
not that but
i broke my original install so i installed another to test stuff on first before breaking everything üòÜ
im pointing all the installs to one same folder
those probably cover it all, i dont do much high level cutomisation, so that and webui-user.bat should be enough right?
if i have two automatic1111 installs and i want them to be functioally identical, what files need to be copy-pasted
i broke my xformers so im following the tutorial in automatic1111, my whl file is only 400kb tho, shouldnt it be 88mb
how do i refresh or clear and fix those files
idk i guess ill restart but ive never had that ever before
and this isnt working
moved it back
but i tried moving my install to a different drive
sorry to just dump a screenshot and beg for help
personally i just use a poorly cropped stock image of a hat that i paste over the input then use inpainting to fix the perspectiv
Not much, use 2 for more detail (768 res) but personally I try both out when I get to a good point with my prompt
DPM++ 2s a karras
what does inference do?
there should be a license agreement
are you signed in
i see ther k80 is 2 gpus on one card so only 12gb per. so im rather going with the m40. i gotta figure out mounting tho. im thinking just chucking it on my back panel with a pcie extender
cool, so big vram with the newer generations, lots of cuda cores and video out?
What's making the difference between these
And does GPU clock speed matter
And does the cuda cores matter
Gddr3 Vs gddr5
I know one has much more vram. But does the vram generation matter
ebay.co.uk/itm/384845086871
OR
ebay.co.uk/itm/115643433356
exact same images, just made some img2img variations and used shivams. 1600 steps everything else default
INPUT
EZ PZ PROMPTING
<@220070794791747584>  YOU MY FRIEND ARE MAGICCCC
yeah it converges sooner and IMO has more texture
dpm++ a s karras (i think thats the naem) is my favourite, 17 or so steps and it comes together nicely
make sure ur using 768x768
where do you get that?
what do you find generally to be the best upscaler
I couldn't figure out Loras on automatic, currently I'm stuck on cloud, I've only got 8gb
I may as well use whatevers working for you
Ah shivams?
Thank you, do you know if lastbens has prior preservation
Ohh sick, so I take some images of them and use img2jmg   to remaster into other styles. Then feed it to the AI providing different perspectives, poses and lighting
Or not enough background visible in images
Would too similar poses in inputs cause thag
Sorry I meant train on a person then generate anime style images of them for example. I think it was overtraining but I'm out rn so can't test
i cant get any stylised images
dreambooth training can't get output top look different than input
like sunglasses
can my subject in dreambooth be wearing a hat or glasses
yeh i see the training dropping from 24gb to 12 recently. any minute now well get down to 8gb
8gb üò¢ , got a 3060ti, shoulda sprung for a higher teir
ah no need to faff with kaggle
ohhh i thought once u used up yout time that was final
thank you all]#
time to grovel to friends
ah thats unfortanute
do you train locally?
agh, this is so difficult. you got a go-to online way to train?
ah thats a shame, do you see how i use the 1.5 model?
i get this erro]
speaking of, could someone lend me a hand with the kaggle version of thelastben's dreambooth coldab. i cant figure out how to set the v2 model
when training on a subject, if i have 20 images using thelastbens version, whqat settings should i use and whats the instance names relevance
using swinir4x
but all my results look like this
sd upscale
im trying to use 2d upscale
how do i switch
instead of style
but i think i trained on subjects
ive trained a model using the kaggle version of thelastbens colab
mind if i share a couple favourites
oh sick
oh? just defaalt, whats the prompt
oooh, what ckpt
restart and lmk what it/s you get
yupp, these are just for speed
set COMMANDLINE_ARGS=--deepdanbooru --xformers --opt-channelslast 
git pull

these are what i use. git pull will update you to the latest branch on launch, deepdanbooru is like the interrogate model but for anime styles, xformers will speed up the generations and optchannelslast im told also speeds up but im not 100% sure to take it or leave it
open webui-user.bat with a text editor
is that xformers on or off?
yup
this number
what kinda its/s do you get with that
yeah, we'll get there soon enough
its so good. just not enough vram :sadge:
so close yet so far to the vram req
stuck on 3060ti
ah lucky bugger
i got tired of colab running out of time, id personally reccomend the  kaggle notebook. bit of an effort to setup but its 100% free
where you running it?
ah im fairly clueless myself, just came here for help with dreambooth
set to true
ui-config.json
its not *always * an improvement, but it helps for certain images
you can enable restore faces by default if youd like to
no no, that influences what restore faces does
automatic1111?
make suer you use that
codeformers best
imo
uses codeformer of gfpgan to "fix" the face
is there a 8gb of vram dreambooth trainer
from here
i think this covers all i need
pip install torch diffusers transformers pytorch-lightning
so he does
ah
this seems like quite abit compared to the guide video
looking at the install page
nah it says invalid syntax
sorry im so useless at this
erm
sorry where do i rubn that, cmd line?
wdym upgrade, ive got 3.10 installed already when i get webui setup
cool, installing anaconda now
how do i install torch
use task manager to check it still going, and dont tab off he cmd line
can someone help walk me though converting diffusers to ckpt wth 
how do i download that checkpont, its been stuck for a while doing nothing
wont do again
my bad sorry
im trying to make a hypernetwork if it helps
im not sure what this error means? id give more info but idk whats relevant
hey <@295622681565593601> are you available to help me with some modding stuff
sorry to keep changing my mind, i have 20 friends all eager to play üòÖ  and im trying to organise it for them
yes please
in which case. ill start on standard and scale up if i run into issues
sorry to confuse you, ive had a long day. did you mean before that no matter what tier i choose, the NYC server is the only thing available
but if i find i need the premium plan ill migrate to a NYC server
from my understanding, i can get the standard plan on a EU server
oh gotcha, that makes more sense. im new to this sorta thing but thats much more reasonable
that IP would be great, so if i start on a cheaper plan on a EU server and find it doesnt perfom well enough. i can switch to a premium server in NYC and at a later date switch to a EU
it beats my raspberry pi
no problem man id only pay $3 ü§£
and if its terribly high, can i go down a tier and get a EU server
is there a way i can see the ping between here in the UK and as you said the NYC server?
im pretty much sold
well thats fair haha
hows it so cheap
plenty for 10 people ü§£
crikey
gotcha, so how much ram is included in the premium tier?
also, whats mod support like?
hiya, im looking at the premium minecraft plan, reckon its enough for 10 people to play at once?
did u fix it
this is your fault
i will NOT be able to
no
YOU fix it
YOUVE tried to ban me
please just sort this out
im working
i cant
im at work right now
cant you
i just want me steam accoumt
youve tried to ban me
why did you friend me
im not sure i understand what you want
and that filename is unknown.png not profileshots.jpg
but that says someone bought it
i just dont understand
can i see the screenshot
okay
what screen shot did you send there?
how do items get stolen
why am i reported
but
not the other guy
but thats me
huh
yes
np
hi, breh#5731 is doing the steam account scame
a lil something i made with automatic1111's stable diffusion webui
Horrific
Hm
Top right looks sick
I wanna see how abstract it goes
Ew
/imagine Luxor hotel candela brightest light
Lmao, it's a sbt90 made of copper it looks like
simple prompting works too
used tinkercad to create a character and then img2img and interrogate clip to get a stylised chracter
I just hope that they don't fuck it up
It will definitely be powerful
You can get a varjo at that cost
Yeah idk tho
Cheap shit fr
3.5k bro üò≠
ah its a server sorry
nah sorry, playing mc
controlnet
It's magic
Or use a depthmap to keep a similar image but entirely remake it
And control net can copy a person's pose and expression into a entirely new image while keeping the some composition
Photoreal with a good model
Perfect
And a proper res upscale won't be so blocky
Control net is magic once you can use it right
Yup
1024 tall
2x upscale
Oh
The gdrive or this new one
Which one
looks normal at 100% scale but you zoom in and its tiny worlds within the image
that ones much better
yee did you see the google drive attempt
funky upscale attempt
i ***think *** its the woven kevlar
ah nah, most belts look like that inside
watcha thibking of printing one for
idk of many flexible uv-set resins tho
theres some bendy resins
not really
not flexible enough
ive printed some closed loop bands for simple gearing ratio stuff
in theory but youd probably lose a lot of accuracy
thank you, its tomorrow üòé

i gotchu]
Yeeaaah

The s21d is lovely
I've been saving for a mareminco fw1 or thor3 + s2 UV
That's a awesome collection
Damn. Started with a "that's nice"
What do you have?
Yeah! I've got a s21d (added 519a later since it was only available with 219b at the time), l21b with culpm, sc31 pro and 30 degree TIR

is there a way to sort by popular?
just yellow blobs for gates of heaven
sorry i couldt get much good
np
hes got no serial registered so it looks like a naming mishap. vz90 is yours
i let devin know about the serial numbers, ill see what we can do, i dont see any announcement for jason getting vz90 though
oh yeah that sounds fine
honestly, that stuff goes right over my head. you might want to talk directly to maze
i think maze already has a server that we host a lot of stuff on, ill ask him
sure thing, do as much or as little as you want and ill try get it put up online
so you mean make a small simple site for now, and a more complex one later on?
hes happy for you to go ahead
i see i see, thats a cool plan, thanks for offering your time
oh wow, thats awesome! ive just messaged vez, ill let you know what h says as soon as i see his reply, probably gonna be a yes though. i couldvesworn we used to have a website at

I was thinking of doing the same 4 as you. Did you understand much of chemistry at GCSE, because I feel like I don't understand a lot of it but I'm still getting a 9
What'd you keep?
That's fine, sorry for all the questions. But did you start on 4 subjects and drop one, or just three (which did you do)
Do you always have a lesson in the morning or is it a free lesson
Also, do you have to show up for morning form in both years and did you do further maths?
Cool, so you can really come and go whenever it's just rules say must be at form, thanks üëç

maybe its time to upgrade face interface, thanks for all the help
good news, lenses are in they look lovely, im loving the visual boost. BUT they dig into my nose, any solution other than get the glasses spacer? it might just be because i have a big nose and small ipd

it fell out of the right
i can try again without
Lemme know if you need more. Wasn't too sure what angles
if its alright id rather another base, lemme get the other one
Sorry it's so late. I really got carried away, don't worry about rushing to get it sorted
Ooh wow that's sick! I've got a couple printers myself but nothing that high end
I see, out of interest how's the plastic made? I'll have photos in roughly an hour
Cool, you can see glue residue, just seems like the holes a little to big
I've just gone out sorry, I'll send some once I get back. I don't mind gluing them back in. Just wanted to let you guys know
hi im trying to install my lenses. but i cant get them to fit. and the magnets fell out of one side. how do i fix it?

<@540888808640741376>
here
got the yaml?
yup. some other code was remved that they used i think???
ldsr is working, but the last i heard even 16gb isnt enough
nah the 4x upscale also has a huge vram req, but i dont think it ven would start on auto1111
i got some stunning results off it
very offtopic, but im so happy i tried it, did you see that reddit post about use a text AI to make prompts
and same for 2.0 4x upscale
RIP
oh ldsr is fixed. it just has suuuper excessive vram usage
mb
ah that was a question wasnt it
is there a way to rollback and keep all my local changes
that is unfortanute
üíÄ
does automatic support that
download and zoom in on the hair between the cats eyes
original ^
ldsr ^
wait lemme send u my favourite comparison
oh cool, i did do thast before
i saw it adding to my image in some spots
yeh but the detail ü§©
wait is that me, i dont think my question is a bug or error really
i tried using that other autencoder, but it doesnt work, i stay pegged at max vram
is there any eta for LDSR getting fixed?
could someone send me these two
it say no module called pip
i get a error when trying to run the webui a
thank you, if i run into any issues ill open one
would someone point me towards the best place to train the AI on images of myself, on au1111 or anywhere online
a small selection of some of my favourite generations
What's the new meta
I've always used A111
Ty
Awesome
I've never been able to duplicate it
I've got nothing from the original unfortunately
im pretty competent i just dont know the new names/tech
id like to use the character but in a slav squat pose or alik
its a image i generated a while ago
I've been out the game for a while, how can I take a single photo of a character and re-pose them
thats sickk
o shiet i spent ages on that
all made with random seed and dpm++ SDE
clearly the mixes loose a LOT of their flexibility
megamix
anything v3
i cant remeber exactly but drag and drop it into the 'png info' tab and you should see it
2 is what i run at usually
but they both use more vram
batch count will double the time, batch size is faster overall up to around 8 images
no, just a couple images from a earlier batch
i dont have that embedding sorry
euler a sampler
using realistic vision, no negatives
heres my best try at a prompt to recreate that
ahh, a woman standing in front of a carnival ride, higly photorealistic details, official character art, inspired by Richard Schmid, attractive brown hair woman, dressed in short leather jacket, nvidia promotional image, with vivid blue eyes, ultra - realistic faces, a beautiful female wizard, rey tracing
which is that?
you want that digital art style right?
realistic vision maybe?
10-18 on unipc works pretty well too
yep
Not much but it does have a measurable effect
You can set it to full but it will impact performance
whats the original image?
ive never tried changing anything mid render ü§î
set the steps to 5-10
yeah in settings, lemme get a pic
do you have the preview enabled, you can cancel the render if its looking bad
iirc stable horde is free for image gen
ah, controlnet probably wont work on your computer then
when im back a the computer i can try put together some images to show the workflow, but controlnet should help alot for posing and facial features
i try find a photo of the actor in a similar position and then use a bit of controlnet and microsoft word to remove background on the image and posoition it within the image
some good ol fashioned photoshop and inpainting
got a link to that embedding, id like to give it another try
also embeddings are trained for either v1 or v2, and they arent cross compatible
howd you generate that one?
yeah i dont think the ai knew who she was- i kept getting anime characters
imo swin2sr, ldsr and remcri are my favourite
had a couple things setup wrong before
better version of wonderwoman^^
<@698437502125473822>
bruhhh whyy
my prompting for women isnt as great üòÖ
do whart it says on the tin- in settings enable that tickbox
<@698437502125473822>
yup, ill give them a try
no problem, ill drop some finals and you can check them tmrw
more chin, more mask
ah gotcha
what neesd improvement
good or bad?

heres my setup
not sure tbh- i think it helps safetensors load faster. but ive had it therer for ages and im not going to fiddle with a good thing
and ive got this line in my webui-user.bat 
set SAFETENSORS_FAST_GPU=1
just put it into the models folder same as any other
face is a bit funkeee
quick first try
or euler a at 20 steps and cfg 7
all samplers are useable, but id reckon either UniPc at 10-15 steps and a cfg around 4
sure, im running 3060ti- getting around 9-10 it/s
coming right up
awesome
photo-real? cartoon?
any style
gotcha
so one of those characters but with the actors face specified?
sorry its so late, got a little distracted
sure
depends what you're trying. im2img takes an original for inspiration and reimagines based off it
if youve only got a few requests and images to run drop a .txt with your prompts and images and i can run them
so hitting start on 3 tabs wont start 3 at once
yeah they wont run more than one batch at a time
good luck ü´°
ah
what gpu?
but i dont think anys better
you can add --lowvram to auto1111 to make it run on worse hardware tho
afaik- they all perform the same at a basic level
look through olivio sarikas's videos on youtube, he makes guides for most
comfyui, theres a few others just none that come to mind
what error are you gettin
ah alright, cheers
anyone know if is worth installing cuda12, im on 11.3 iirc currently. ive got pytorch 2.0 installed
which part disdnt work?
dunno if it can do it in batches but the clip interrogator extension makes great prompts
tried updating to pytorch 2.0 but couldnt get it working- i wanted to try that xformers alternative
last week was my model prune, moved them onto 3 different drives- my fastest drive gets my top 4, my second fastest gets 13 and my slowest hdd got 34
ive got so many depreciated or abandoned extensions üò§
one of my 30 odd extensions broke it
ah yeah im fairly experienced with it all, just sometimes i get thrown a error and just pray someone else has seen it before because i dnt have the brain power for it
nah manually git pulled them all
ive been meaning to reinstall the venv too anyways
time to work through and find which is the issue
all fixed with the extensions gone
delete the venv folder?
up to date, ill try the extensions
well this cant be good
what gives, controlnets not working at all
only to realize, ive no clue what it all means
ran some auto1111 benchmark
left without, right with
prompt "i float away through the nebula of our universe, imploding stars"
it certainly allowed for a darker image overall
testing noise offset, L-->R: no lora, 1x lora, 2x lora
wdym, the interrupt button?
im using the 726mb ones
ü´°
ive got channelslast and switching and using all models a-okay on a 3060ti 8gb vram
analog diffusion then maybe?
for women
f222
how on earth can my gpu (a lump of metal and sand) imagine so many ~~big titty anime girls~~  abstract ideas and artworks
yeah i say this every time there's a huuuuge jump in output quality but i just have no clue where we're going next. this is all just so... insane
maybe they'll integrate control net too? its quite a shame ip2p is obsolete
sorry pet peeve, its "cinch"
those are probably your best bet
have you tried controlnet or intructpix2pix
no problem
<@637992463621029928>
anime style?
one sec
yup
do you mind sending the img on discord
oh man thats a slow generation, ive youve just got one or two img to run drop the img and the prompt with it and ill run a couple
When you add the keyword you see it
I may be wrong (it applys to dreamboith tho) you shouldn't be seeing the subject when generating with just the lora loaded
What's the output
If you generate with no prompt and the lora
Might be that it's overtraining
Huh
TI just built different
Same reason dreambooth isn't flexible
why not decrease its weight in positive tho
increase in negative
some shoddy photoshop and img2img might be better
mind sharing the input image
did you switch models a lot
it did img2img on a base image
surely the old version of highr es fix does need it
üò≠
but you can reformat
cause lazy
saved over some other .txt i didnt need
welp ill make the lsit and you can port it to wildcards
ahhh
am i blind
is it still here?
<@198270238691688448> i cant find the artist.csv, or the random artist button
500 coming up
cool
how many u want
yeah im making a replacement file rn
<@198270238691688448> how many characters do you want in the list for the random character button
nah just how sd works, thats what high res fix is for iirc
could replace the artist name list with characters i suppose
its not an official continuation
oddly, i miss having a new update daily
Swin2sr goes with swinir and the other in ersgan
or swin2sr
4x remacri foolhardy
its a good time
ive discovered gif2gif
instead of 2 cards rnning 4 together
it'd be faster doing multiple images over multiple cards e.g 2 per card
thatll end up slower since theres a fairly large bottleneck
Maybe?
Maybe bandwidth limit somewhere
Try run a batch of 8 and multiply the it/s by 8
Maybe other hardware issues
at least youll be really good at it after all the recompiling??  üíÄ
so i suppose thatd be the text
it uses a extra gb over a normal fp16 pruned model
thats cool
ooh so a normal model makes no difference but since its got the text processor it might reduce usage
same for <@270739902340005888>
but the non pruned 7gb gives me OOM
just wondering since the pruned pix2pix model runs fine
funky
huh
hey <@105458332365504512> do you know if smaller models use less vram during generation?
link??
<@105458332365504512> i see why the number is so high, it didnt need to prune or convert anything just change format
i usually get 56it/s when converting
unlocked my other 2 million cuda cores
mustve been the updated 3060ti drivers
565,000 it/s
but that dont look right
im no profesional
Not to sound too arrogant but I reckon I'm getting the hang of this AI business
thats where i got my knowledge
<@198270238691688448> follow mcmonkeys links
Try Google?
There's a GitHub thread about it tho
Honestly, not sure, my GPU didn't need it
I get 11 it/s on a 3060ti
I don't think they will automatically
I reckon you gotta update
And 4090 you may need to update cudnn and pytorch
Using xformers?
Safer mostly and Apparently faster load times but I'm not sure
Awesome, I'll check this out later
How many it/s do you get
Icl that's pretty poor, using my 3060ti I get around 3 seconds
all done
brb
yeh i always feel bad spamming, idk if me gens fit those categories but off i go
also whats the upload limit here
i can share my entire favourites folder, which channel?
Eh?
id love to know more about that kinda stuff
oh man thats awesome
Hey <@105458332365504512> how do you know so much about Stable Diffusion?
Ooh that's my bad
Is it similar to riffusion or is proper text2music
i wasnt using it right
it isss
okay im gonna sound like a idiot, but i thought the model wasnt even that good
is your resolution set right, also i gotta try it
im not sure
i think, "ornate room, tiled floor" is better
also you wont see the grayscale output iirc it doesnt get output
you need a prompt
depends, do you use any K sampler often
nop
you might see a download start if its the first time youve used it
it should just go
nothing else
and when you select it?
does it show up in the UI
that all looks correct to me
so whatve you done with the .safetensor or .ckpt
okay okay
and is there a specific error in the console?
do you have the correct .yaml
but
so that was a bit more than 10 minutes
i gtg for 10m but after ill help troubleshoot
just keep a copy of the config, there might be a way to do it how you say tho
idk what kinda load times you get but i get ~2.7s for every .safetensor
partially as habit out of safety and partially because iirc they load faster
i prefer the .safetensors
click either of those and the download will start
<#1045089569030295662> possibly
üòÜ thats a good one, mind if i steal it
iron*cat*
but so *right*
id reccomend max extension of 128 pixels per iteration, so itll be faster to do on smaller images as youll need less steps to change the aspect rato
thats outpainting you want
the depth maps are generated and used with this model, the webui wont do it automatically without the new model
this *should * be it
are you on automatic1111
use depth2img model
ahh i just read that hahah
ooooh, finally
im sure thats fixed it
oh i see, theres a pull request fixing that so ive switched to that for nw
you could probably do it on v1.5 or 2.1 just fine
hm, git pulled and got this
on or off?
ill be honest, i didnt bother fixing, just re downloaded the rpository and ported all my important files. but it *might * be deleting the venv folder
just trying to squeeze every drop of perf outta a 3060ti
cool
ah yeah i got that one already
are these optimizations i should be doing or are they already in use or are they irrelevant to auto1111
WHICH IS BEST FOR PURE IMAGE GEN
every time i click generate, have a counter tick up by one on auto1111
is there a way to get a image gen counter
usually i trust it, just dont want to reset my entire repo, anyways, ill go manual then git pull to fix it
if i manually download and replcae the files from my current commit version will that fix it
only those files? nothing else
copy paste
in cmd prompt
hiow do i just override those files
install pip
x formers no?
ye,in settings perview, theres a choice of original? aprox nn and something else
brev
worth updating~?
hm
cool, that sounds perfect
and is it possible to get a 50/50 split, some on my ssd in the default location and some in a custom location on a harddrive? if not ill just put them all on the harddrive
id just like to huck all my checkpoints on a harddrive, im using auto1111
is there a way to change the model directory
reduce denoising
its so good
how do i get started replicating this
yeah it didnt work
it should be 80mb no?
hm i followed it and got  a 400kb file
is this the right way to fix it
im trying a manual install now 
tried getting xformers
oy thats not good
wish me luck
glasses, hairstyle, wearing a hoodie, thin eyes
only 100 steps in and its got some basic features down
its going okay-ish
trying a self TI
drop the img into the png_info tab
and im using safetensors rn
idk if its the right thing but its in my webui-user.bat
set SAFETENSORS_FAST_GPU=1
or most general settings
whata the best settings here?
anyway to have this be changeable on the fly
Might be .pt not vae
I think
Anything-v3.ckpt.vae
So
Place it next to the anything V3 checkpoint and name it the exact ssame thing including .ckpt then put .vae on the end
best i could get off midjourney
this kinda stuff. its just *begging * for AI art
this kinda creature
those are just so pretty
im going for the leviathan creatures and the bioluminescent plants
have you seen the game?
cool, i can go for TI that'll give me much more flexibility, im stuck on a 8gb gpu for the foreseeable future, lemme finish up my work and ill try my hand at captioning. i only need the style really
hey sorry to hop on this but id love to have a underwater/subnautica style model. id be willing to find and crop 30-40 768x768 images and caption them for style if you would train with it? i never figured out style only got training a subject
<@183881722562215936> knollingcase model is where its at imo ^
analog stlye^
more realistic
the last 3 are from anything-v3
arcane style is pretty good imo
i had a very different style spaceship in mind
whats your prompt?
nkinkpunk looks pretty but not great for space
yeah in txt2img but i keep my inpainting prompts really short
so its no horny prompt
negative prompt first word is nipples
it just gets better posing and faces
I borrowed some from a friend
IM SORRY
when you inpaint do you prompt for the entire image or just the feature?
ah cool cool

full progress, starting at outpainting
<@298161872236969984>
one sec
lemme make a gif with all the progress pics
i usually use normal, idk if theres much difference
just target one feature at a time then hit send to inpaint and target a new feature
final image after targeting each edited section
used mspaint to copy elements of the image and strategically place them where i wanted a certain feature
outpainted from original but wasnt happy]
not posting in the proper area as ive lost the original image and its prompt
lmk if you want progress pics
s lil peice i made, outpainted then thoroughly inpainted
i miss proper highres fi, you could set the first pass to be square but the final to be close to 16:9 and not have to worry that the AI sucks at non square sizes
lemme retry in a sec
ah im using a dpm sampler
and is euler a faster than the others?
hm, ill check task manager, would a higher step count slow it down?
same image size
how come sometimes i get 9it/s and sometimes 3it/s on the same system, same conditions afaik both after a complete restart
dang just saw i was using the same seed in every image, explains why some came out so poorly
ah i see, i gotta do some upscale and inpainting first anyways
ill post some of the better ones later

less than a hour ago
maybe try again?

hey i managed to make this in AI but how do i specifically prompt for that style in the top right
i can run a couple gens for you
send your prompt
idk i tried expanding and it just gace me a squished img+white bar
wuts the use for this canvas thingy in the img2img tab#
could someone run a gigapixel upscale for me?
I always forget
You 100% working at the right resolution
Does automatic allow you to drag and drop safetensors in the same manner as ckpt
gorge washinmachine
wow, thanks for all the detail. so i guess ill start properly labelling images where it matters. would specifying "making a funny face" help? also i find paint is really good for manual crops
i usually just crop square and use powertools to resize to 512x. do you know if every implementation would benefit from "a selfie of sammy wearing a beanie.png"
ohh captioned. i though u mean going me(n).png
bro u renaming individually?
img2img works fine at blending bad photoshop for those one off deals
yeah for one offs not worth it, but i like it for making my friends
nah nah. not me, its my friend, ive got permission to share it
just got into dreambooth training, this is one of my favourite gens (plus irl photo for reference)
yeah i mostly use img2img to smooth out my crappy paint.exe edits
yeah not sure whats up with those square artifacts
i dont like style transfers personally. much prefer txt2img
yeah that was cool, i liek the race
data i hope, i think it was trained on images with clear brush texture
used the concep.ckpt and some prompty stuff that i cant remeber :sad:
so variations of that? what style?
oh more painted?
or more cartoon
<@879814788778172426>  hows this?
what style are you aiming for?
we competing? my poor gpu boutta get punished
good luck
id say mount it to the back panel and use a roller/ fishing wire to turn it
got a pic? could probably do a pulley setup
no problem, lemme know how it goes
yeah maze practically took me step by step on building my first printer, way back when before i understood what all the different printer specs even meant
everyione there is so smart, its crazy
hahaha same, started on a voron, saw the price went ender 5 corexy, couldnt get it working and went for vzbot
what printer do you run?
still kicking around, im gonna reuse its part for the vzbots z and save a couple bucks. im gonna save and build all metal just for shits and giggles
the build plate sticks well enough i can print without enclosure so far, ive got a couple sheets of insulation i prop up for big prints tho
yeah got my cr10s for my 13th and its been running nicely since, tried upgrading a ender 5 to corexy,the thing spent more time being worked on than printing
yeah i always feel bad im on the team but no printer
i havent been able to afford one, still not old enough to get a job. but ill soon be done with a lifeguard certification so i can build one soon
well
ah üòÖ
nah hour drive it looks like
ü§£ i do it just in case, for every parcel
north london
awesome, ill send a photo of the letter + receipt in a sec
all good
paypal please, to matthew@matthewweinberger.com
Is it not here
True, I can ask about it
Are you sure? I can ask about getting the mounting holes and stuff on a model
<@819656442113163285>
best youd do is buy from another user
nah no plans that im aware of to make anything prebuilt entirely
and yeah maze's design
everythign except the balls are custom
for how much?
its a lttle easier
for 48v
high voltage
other than less heat, any considerable improvement
can you just desolder and resolder better ones
is it better to be at 1e2 vs 1e6 (just example numbers)
give @mellow a ask
there might be some super early prototypes, could always ask ming to run a few kgs of glow in the dark through one to see how it fares
<@872305895957233675> <@200013114937311232> I might be wrong but I think he intends to sell the normal heatsink separately as well
and vzbot kit is all metal
and reliability
and speed
vzbot kit vs v2.4
price
too easy of a decision
vzbot]
i might wait for a local reseller or alike
my total omes in sub 1.5k
ouch
ü•∫
i assume he meant to @ sworafs
got 2.5 months off schoo then
im waiting til summer üíÄ
ill be waiting to snag one tmrw too
i dont have specifics but i know its lower than buying individually, so getting a kit will save money. it comes with external5150 the super8 iirc and ALL the bells and whistles
rip

when your on pc lemme know
ah darn
weewoooweeeewooo
lemme know when u are watching the channel

get the collection going
need hannah]
we got 2 of you
I NEED A WEEB DANCE
yuppp
we just phone call
hes just msging other ppl
idk
phone all 3
we play truth or dare
i was thinking
no no
kinda awkard
without max
wanna go back to just 3?
important q
with hannah
wanna vc
u gotta vc
is it good?
he said hes cool
u sure?
try again
in the sevrer i invited you to
join the vc for a quiz
in vc
song quiz]
hmm
whats that meen
dont mention it but he called leon a "renegade retard"
that is quite unfortanute
ahh
ahhh, whered you hear him say it
did you say something?
Something about marco
whys felix complaining hes in triouble?
250mm/s seems to have upset my VzBot
hiya, am i able to get 0.6kg of the PolyWood (and tpu) or is it not part of the deal?
Nah it was just him taking selfies with different people
also did samuel
ai giveth and taketh away
cant lie tho its very cool
well its certainly not perfect
debatable, its different for sure. but its certainly got a lot of uses
u got any image requests
u can train the AI on a person and it cn generate any photo of them from that
u as a nun
wdym
kinda
it works
alright ill try with a couple, cheers
e.g
i cant find anyone with good photos, theyd havw to be varied backgrounds, different distances and expressions
ah nvm then
this is the best out of 50 images, and its not very realistic
none of my other friends take photos
would you be interested in sending a few iimages of urself, for me to use on the AI. i made some of charlie but only had 3 to use so it doesnt look very good
me an robbie having deeper convos than u and him
longest convo with robbi]
solution to all your art issues
Just click share to computer on chrome
Huh
just msg it to me

physics now?
The vessel left the port hours ago. They finally reached the great barrier reef. The colossal ship gently floated being heled up by over 10 km of waters. Below them laid another world of creature some never before seen by anyone.  The cruise ship was glowing as the suns rays gently laid themselves on the ship. The distinct pink and yellow corals caught the eye of many of the passengers aboard the vast ship. Many children were tapping their parents and pointing towards some jumping dolphins. The shipped lowered a substantial anchor into the depths of the cosmic like ocean.
Click. Max opened his plastic bottle so he could drink some water, he promptly finished the bottle chucking it behind his back. Splash. The water landed in the blue abyss sending ripples through out the vast sea. Max thought nothing of it.
The plastic bottle laid peacefully on top of the sae. Jellyfish, sea urchins and squids all passed the bottle looking at with curiosity. The ship was long gone with them leaving 2 days ago. The bottled continued to relax being blanketed by the warmth of the sun, until a small young dolphin noticed it. It inspected the unusual object and innocently tried to eat it.
The dolphin started to choke. The dolphin couldn‚Äôt stop, with its little remaining energy it tried to push it out. It tried with all its might, but it slowly ran out of energy. The body started to sink. The limp dolphin reached the bottom of the sea where it lay dead with hundreds of other dead fish and dolphins. The plastic bottle slowly began to escape the corpses body. Pilling up back at the top of the ocean waiting for its next victim.
Threshing waters wash over me. My free will seized by the waves, slamming me through an unforgiving sea. Id been cast overboard by a violent tipping and tilting of the boat. Put out to sea by a callous power far greater than I. the thrum of my ferry fades, its garish colours slip away. 
No alarm will ring for a plastic bottle overboard, though it should. this is a life sentence much longer than most, a millennium forgotten at sea.
I resign myself to the waters, my descent to a seabed is gentle. It‚Äôs not uncommon, I pass many a brother and sister. I settle into the sand; my only visitors are inquisitive creatures.  From here I can see all that transpires above.
I once saw the delicately fading sun beams twist beneath the water, scuttling over shells and coral. Illuminating their vivid primaries. Boats scuttle across an otherwise still ocean, their propellers sending dances of sand and silt through the water. Their contrasting dances spinning overhead, delighting even the calmest critters. Swarms of jellyfish intermingle with plastic bags their translucent bodies casting soft shadows across me. The occasional whale will pass, their gargantuan bodies sending powerful waves past. Kelp forests flatten under the waves, they flail, and twist forever entangled with each other.
 But now its different, cloudy, murky waters obscure much else. Their permanent ashen colour casting a faltering light across me. The only thing illuminated now is the lifeless skeleton of a once joyous coral kingdom. White and soulless their creeping fingers reach towards the surface. The kelp forest long smothered by fishing nets. Their strangled leaves limply lean in the currents. A once lively landscape now forgotten and dead.




.
i gotchu
sure ill send
was busy
soreeee
cool cool, just checking
we still on?
cool
idm any time, just on with marc playing ov2
call later? i wanna do that test
wanna join me and marc doing  fisiscs
they nearly ran into some old lady üíÄ
eh takes a couple minutes
nah nah, i just send them on discord then download
yupp, one fell over

oooh. tempting
and spider
<@756346171856912425> is the octopus and lgx lite still available
oh i see i see. good luck with the rest
if anyone else comes for them though dont hesitate to sell them
hm, tempting. can i think about it
oh no no, i can wait 2 weeks. whats the snail mail option
Coral Gables, FL 33156, USA
oops sorry
if not, maybe another day. sorry to dissapoint
4994 Hammock Lakes Dr
it is, but out my budget
ooph, 20 shipping. nothing cheaper? sorry ijm being so stingy, id usually go for the real budget stuff
how much would shipping be to florida
whats your loaction, thinking of buying the octopus, and maybe the lgx lite
no no, where in connecticut, my family are on the border of new york  and Connecticut
where? <@127589634522742795>
i have family there
ooooh
is that a max flow issue, seems like a very nice tactile surface. is noticeable to touch
sorry, too far away, opposite sides of the state
Nice to hear it's fixed. I got close on the setting. Wrong page tho
maybe its just levelling
im not seeing much differtence between our settings]
cya
so that certainly isnt it
set the angle to zero real quick and can i see whats in connection length
send a screenshot of your whole infill tab
are you using arachne or just the defaut slicer
slightly different slicing settins. but that infill doesnt look the same
mind sending a full image of the sliced bottom layer
i cant find the section matching the image you sent earlier
i cant tell
send over your file, lets get a direct comparison
heres what my slicer shows, seems some of the gaps are in the slicer
mb
meant nozzle sorry
idk if it makes a difference but does klipper have the correct line width set
klipper?
right line width/ nozzle set
id check you didnt diddle the slicer infill overlap setting first
prompt???
66B i think refers to the number of parameters
changed the launch flag
ran that cmd
im not sure were i went wrong tbh
hm
i dont  think it worked
awesome!
if ive got cuda 11.8 which cmd do i use
how difficult can pytorch 2.0 be to install
does anyone have expirience with local training with this
i was just using your repo
the man, the myth, legend
Oh I see
whats GM mean?
it may be in the .bin format but you can change the .bin to be .pt
it can be anything
whatever xxxxx is is what you type in the prompt
it should be xxxxx.pt
thank you
whats the last ones prompt
drip forg
hello, where are you running those commands?
i saw this post 
Just switch true to false
It should have UI in the name
In a .txt or .JSON in the root folder
Here's a list of artists to use in the prompt xyz.  Use up to 4 of these to create a new style
Then gave it a huge list of 200 artists, 500 adjectives and told it to use the noun I tell it
Yeah I taught it the proper syntax, word order, and brackets
Best part is chatgpt prompted it
just a screenshot but its pretty good for native eh
its one of my favourites
yepp
I've got a 16k image
Especially sd upscale
Ah upscaling is really fun
I'll have to upload later
So it's 185mb
I've upscaled it pretty far
i managed to get some good 1080p native images
you made anything cool recently?
ty ty
just rename
thats the one working for me
One sec
Potentially, I can't remember
i think unless the maker specifies it, the one yaml will work for all 2.1 models, just copy-paste and rename
just have the same name as the 2.1 file
Do you have the yaml file
Anyways
Yep ive got it, I'll be honest, best part is the embeddings out there for it, otherwise I don't see too much gain, tho custom models are very good on it
Cool cool. Just incase you didn't see it. Automatic1111 also does it
Nah like which program
How're you going to run it
Yep. It's awesome creating photos of yourself never taken
Is that David Bowie in the 2nd image?
No problem üòä, if you ever need some guidance just reach out
you can merge models, not sure how itll g for a face+style but theres also texteal inversions for arcane style
very nice, ill send you a couple tips tomorow
odd, troubleshoot tmrw?
i havent tried 2.0 afaik its just a new prompt style but im not sure. depth-img sounds fantastic tho
got this with the promp "large sailboat out at sea, stormy, oled, annotated, knollingcase"  and using a custom model
i nearly gave up cause i couldnt figure out how to use git pull üíÄ
id reccomend browsing through r/stablediffusion and sorting by top of the past month to catchup on new models
still dont get a lot of the code, thats far beyond me
yeh haha ive just put a loooot of time into trial and error
v3 is what im running, its pretty good
the progress bar sometimes gets stuck, but unless you see it freeze or an error in the cmd then it'll probably be fine
yup, ive got gobs of models for every use. just mke sure to use the phrase it tells you
which part stutters? the whole pc or the progress bar or it just stops entirely?
batch size is like baking 20 cookies on one tray
batch count is cooking 1 cookie on a tray 20 times
quick tip, use batch size instead of batch count for faster speeds
will do, gimme a sec
these are a couple of my favourites, theres a few more in a sec
for something nuetral, i usually just hit generate with no prompting, you can also see what images the model biases towards sometimes
is your pfp also a AI gen?
4090 should be in the 30s'
my 3060ti get 10 on a good day for 512x512
iteration/second
but it/s
its not measured in fps here
i mean, the 4090 is a beast at this
i gotta update some old dependencies
and im still not running perfectly optimised
the gif i sent was 5m
singular images re usually 5s or so
i dont delve into video too often, i dont like the render times
heh
messages sent over 4 minutes
me in different styles
<@140187416374935552>
ill be honest. most custom models arent trained on POC so the AI really struggles with them
one of my favourite models makes these style images easssily
so that i dont cherry pick a good starter, you choose
choose any celebrity then
hm
send me any photo, ill switch its style
my favourite is style transfers
yeah but the lowest carriage is floating ü§£
high res 3D printer
theres a school photo VS ai gen (prompt was propoganda poster of Matthew)
yeah i tried making one trained on my face. but i dont have enough photos of me in varied environments and clothes and expressions. you can run it on ~12 images and get okay results but they should all be solo photos and very varied
i cant remeber the license on every model, but i think a lot are free use stuff. but im not at the stage where id bother selling it or using in business. if someone wnted to sell my works i wouldnt mind but currently theres no point
midjourney's AI is better since they use curated input images for their model plus some automatic post processing, the one i use just uses laion-b for its dataset which is kinda arse
yup, you give it some images of a style or subject (i accidentally did a subject training which is why my output images look like a mish mash of the inputs)
if i trained it on the vzbot then it'd work probably. but training takes a coupke hours on a kaggle notebook, or ~20m on a 12gb vram card run locally. unfortanutely i only have 8g vram so i cant do local training
the monsters made are from a model entirely made by me. but most of my work is from others models
running Automatic1111 version locally, using a variety of checkpoints (entirely separate models) and textual inversion (guide the ai to a object or style)
i can make something in AI now, gimme a subject
absolutely 0 art skill otherwise
not in all cases. theres different ways of training. some influence other models, some are entirely brand new models
these are faily "painted" images
to stop the clutter

Hello
I don't know, I'm in the UK
You'll have to guide me through that a bit as I couldn't find somewhere to do that
can you do a bank transfer?
thank, sorry for the angry message, just frustrated trying to access it
Please take it back and pay me appropriately
Any non crypto method is okay I just can't afford to put money in to access my money not to mention I'll lose on gas fees every time I move it
I need the money and I can't afford to put more in just to access the funds
Hi I'm going to have to send your crypto back
Is there much I can do with usdc without transfer to Ethereum first?
So I should buy the minimum amount of Ethereum then do the swap and then deposit to my bank account
So to do the swap I need Ethereum first to pay the gas fee?
It's saying 10 USD to transfer the money
I'll try again later, must just be really high nos
Oh I see
Lemme try send it back
Yeah it might be better to do directly as Ethereum then
Sorry to ask, but would it be cheaper for you to send directly via Ethereum? Instead of usdc and me exchanging it
Cool
So when would be ideal to do this exchange
Oh I see, so later it'll be cheaper?
Metamask says swapping costs 11usd?
Hey how can I exchange usdc to Ethereum
thank you!
nah dont worry, thank you for the help setting it up
Yes
0x001435383929aFa3d31496d41791557c55Ae6BD1
yes ill figure something out
to this address
ah sorry to change again, binance requires a lot of ID, ill rather use metamask
0x001435383929aFa3d31496d41791557c55Ae6BD1
usdc it is, ill do through binance
Does it need to be for a specific coin? And can I transfer this to my bank account after?
Does this look right
0xc0471A7CfC337EC38B4a1Aa4aeeEBc86aC9de307
where should i set that up? im new to crypto
yeah alright, ill go set it up, sorry the paypal didnt work out
Thanks for doing it with paypal
Cool, that's alright
Just did, do you see it?
thank you for letting me know instead of just paying the 22. very kind of you
oops my bad, sent it from my phone, mustve typed it wrong
thank you üëç
matthew@matthewweinberger.com for 25 gbp
sorry, id rather avoid crypto entirely, is there no way for you to use any of the other payment methods
Or cashapp, or direct transfer
I can do paypal
üëç
Is there any non crypto method
How would you like to pay
so it needs more texture in which parts?
to which image?
im not sure what needs changing
does it need more texture in that image?
mb
oh i see
sorry man had to head off to bed, lemme finbish up
awesome, so thats all 3 üòÖ
all good? or does it need any changes
hows this for style?
same parameters for colour or style?
sorry what needs changing then
do you mean the window fram, the solid part, or the transparent part
sorry im not sure i understand, which part specifically
cool, ill fix the roof then
hows the view out the window
wait have you clicked the link or just viewing it in discord?
in which part? window?
i think it needs a little less saturation, otherwise much better?
i can try
details easy to add back in, just gotta get the style right
not much better?
im not sure its quite there
ignore the sign for now, hows he rest
ahhh, one moment
üëç  or üëé
was this then just for me to upscale it and it'd be finished?
awesome, ill get to finishing 4, and 3 i think you said you were doing some work on?
does it haver to be the correct letters or just resemble the original
but of a tricky one
hey im stuck on that red neon sign still
sorry ive been working on the sign, the AI doesnt understand text very well
is it not good?, i can try fix it
Then add some texture to the bulbs and roof?
Any better
Is this good for more colour
Texture on which part, I usually hand draw that
Sorry I've got no access to my usual accounts so I've got to hold off on the pay
can i ask what these are for?
hows this one
with the pole?
a little bit of inpaint and manual work
hey sorry its so late, ive sorted most of my issues and managed to get this generation
but an upside is i now have the google pixel 6A which has so real nice photo editing which should benefit my workflow
hey sorry for the silence, i was mugged last night and have been dealing with getting replacements
yeah sorry, thats the wrong version
hows these?
not sure how much i can do for the city without changing it entirely
brighter images i hope üòÖ
awesome
Awesome, I've got some Christmas plans for the next ~3 hours but should be a quick change when I'm back
Definitely, like the image of the wine barrels you sent a while ago
so what needs changing next?
combined
better clouds
ive got something good for the people removal
good news
cool, im out currently but ill give it a try once im back
i can try that
like more stylised?
hi sorry for the no messages, ive tried removing the people specifically not replacing them but theres not a ton i can do, i really cant get stable diffusion to cooperate
Yeah I'm going through half manually half stable diffusion. Not to sound like a broken record but the darkness makes it difficult
ive got to pause so heres where im up to so far, ive got to fix how the city looks and then add back the railing to the foreground
a mix of sd and Microsoft paint üòÖ
Sorry I mean to better understand what to replace the people with, what are they standing on. E.g if they were in a park I'd replace them with grass not concrete
Okay, are the people standing on a rooftop? Where are they?
Remove people by cropping or just make it a empty space
with such a dark image theres not a lot i can do sorry
i don think its any better
Yes, I can go try in a hour
Alright, I'll see what I can do, a lot of the image is black though which makes it difficult to change or create detail in
is it too similar to the original
what do you think of this?
" more to come"  üòç
nah dont worry, i want to make sure i can do what you need before i get any money
i can give it a try
so youd like this image in a painted style?
so ive spent some time trying to get the style right but dont think i can without the training, so send over those photos when you get the chance and ill see what i can do
sorry, what does wire mean? if you mean send some money first id be more comfortable getting the style correct first before being payed
its just a quick attempt using those first few images and a quick training
hi let me know if any of these are what you need
thank you
custom models are what people are refering to when they say ckpt
to create a custom model (to specifically create the style you need). you need a lot of images of different items in the same style so that the AI knows what it looks like
in a high resolution, or with a link to the high resolution version
hi can you send as many images as you can (30 maximum) of the style you'd like
I am British
Yes
Ah I see, opposite time zones. I'll try use Google translate to make sure my messages make sense
Cool, I'll get started on it tomorrow, also can I ask what's your first language?
It means "A little bit"
Might cost a smidge tho?
Should be able to. If not I can make a custom model
Ah cool, I get off school tomorrow so type up all the stuff and I'll reply when I get a chance
hey i just wanted to check when i could start on those images

Yeah I'd be happy with that, easy pics 5 harder ones 8
oh shit. im down, you looking to pay per image?
i hope you find someone good
its cool, you're looking in hobbyist spaces to hire
thats cool, good luck
duh
ohhhh ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
in the server it says, "now hiring". whats that for?
ü§∑  i just saw yall competing in general, did i miss something before
sorry i must have missed something, what do you mean?
ah my nights just starting, 10 pm  here
morning?
ill get it
funky
made with illuminati diffusion
do you know what brand those lear rails are
hello
Use some negative prompts too
Yeah inpaint and describe the pose and emphasize the hand
To fix the hand, try inpainting with the same model
HM when you say failed, that probably indicates you got a funky setting or prompt
best you can do is mess around with the prompt to find the keyword and use the same seed
yup, ive got a lot of effects i want to recreate but it never will
or fine tune
but that sounds like either merge with a POC oriented model
ill be honest, not a clue
protogen and berry mix are alright
it suffers with dark skin tones
yeah especially the anything-v3 model
what was the issue?
obvious but just wanted to check
did you click the "load from" button
might help you with the different poses/clothing
Happy to help
Np
airplane pilot uniform, 1girl, uniform, breasts, hat, black hair, skirt, solo, blue eyes, open mouth, thighhighs, pencil skirt, huge breasts, long hair, smile, peaked cap, blue skirt, blue headwear, cuffs, wrist cuffs, police uniform, blue shirt, thighs, police, large breasts, belt, looking at viewer, hand on own chest, military 
thats the prompt i got from the AI and using the anything-v3 checkpoint
nah just a space to add another
in the launch args in webui-user.bat add    --deepdanbooru
i wont lie, interrogate deepdanbooru on img2img then went to txt2img
this good?
ü§® watchu up to
send over the image
lemme try some stuff
do you want to change the face? background? pose?
sorry this videos a bit of a mess, im not as good at outpainting
sure
outpaintingmk2 in img2img
You can upload to Imgur if you want to share anywhere
No problem
eh go on then
how lewd???
go on then üòÉ
ah but its fun having a 150mb image
but ive gone up to 16,000x9,000 just fine
for time reasons
if its already huge go for 2x
any should do
you can always set the secondary upscaler to swinir but its not necessary
ahh, r-ersgan 4x+ anime6b should be your best bet
photoreal? anime? digital art?
what styles the image?
you can also add
git pull
set SAFETENSORS_FAST_GPU=1
set "ACCELERATE=True"

the first one will keep your install up to date
the second allows you to use the .saftensors format faster
the third im not to sure but i think it helps speed up the initial launch
yup
--opt-channelslast   is also meant to help  but i cant remember if its 30 series only
i see, yeah just stick --xformers in args in the webui-user.bat
what gpu?
yeah that'll help
would another video guide help
i cant call sorry
upscale 4x with ldsr
ouch, bit large for sd upscale. id rather use the extras tab and LDSR
sorry dimensions
whats the input image size
sheesh
ldsr?
yea
ah
sd upscale breaks the image into tiles and runs img2img and increases resoltuion, then stitches those tiles back together
the height and width just decide the tile size so generally 512x512 is best
if you want to expand thats the outpaintingmk2 script and some different settings
both are equally fast
but i think either works
yup, i prefer the dpm+++ 2m sampler
ooh LDSR may hang or be really slow if youve got low vram, otherwise no upscaler or the rersgan upscaler works fine
let me know if theres any unclear parts or anything needing more explanation
alright made a video going through my setup
as for a transcription of m profile within my profile would be a never ending loop
it was meant to go on forever
haha i hit a character limit there
np its confusing
need help with the sd upscale script?
no problem
how much?
Middle ground, the amount of upkeep is already overwhelming and there doesn't seem to be any impact on the prints themselves
im hosting one rn and i want it to either be almost free or like 1/3 the levels
is there a way to lower the level requirements foor the entire server
stone fired ~~pizza ~~ vzbot when?
Right

but i reckon smaller checkpoint ---> less vram
im no scientist and i havent backed up my theory at all
down to 80gb
ive more han halved my entire model collection
it even works on the VAE
np
iirc if you delete the venv itll try reinstall from scratch
erm, i just stuck it in there and it auto installed, it was a no fuss ordeal
--deepdanbooru --opt-channelslast --autolaunch --xformers
nope
and make it a .safetensor
i did prune the model tho
honestly, opened auto1111 and downloaded the pix2pix model and hit generate, nuthing special
mines working on under 8gb

pose transfer
it also lets you create specific poses
prompt was "anime boy posing for camera, outdoors, cozy"
just a quick example of controlnet for transforming images
imo
currently the best is stable diffusion + controlnet
the dalle2 model can be replicated but its also clsoed source- they released a paper on how they trained it
so thats just a guess
everythings closed source
nop
since humans are the best judge of image quality
likely uses the user feedback to train the model too
so's midjourney, they just have a much better trained model +some other processing iirc
the image looks more detailed to me
i think i prefer stable diffusion
its alright, lemme compare to stable diffusion tho
this stable diffusions attempt
although
it ignored most of my prompt

I picked engineering project six as my first choice due to my prior engagement in project documentation and design, albeit at a hobbyist level. what jumps out at me about project six is the approach of going from a first concept to a completed proposal backed by calculations. while I have developed my skills in fabricating parts for home use, I recognize that technical drawings and following pre construed standards is important. though I currently have no experience in this I am excited to learn more and work at a professional level.

Have fun with the inpaintint
Np
Show him the whole img changing and mention the tensors error when changing the conditional mask
I can send you a invite to another server, a guy mcmonkey there can probably help you, the guys a genius
That really shouldn't be a problem
Ah shizzle I can't remember how to fix that error
But try it set around 0.1
It's somewhere in settings, I can't remember where tho
Only thing it might maybe be ks the conditional mask weight
Not img2img
You 100% sure your in the inpainting tab
Bloody hell
Then save and double click that file
Perfect
Mb
Before the call line sorry
Add a new line that says "git pull" (no quotation marks)
If you open the webui user.bat file in notepad
Do you know how to git pull
I was using auto1111
That shouldn't be it, v2 stilm runs in auto1111
512
You tried a square resolution and set to "just resize"
Hmm
That's fine then
should be a drop down
Do you see a menu in the top left of the UI
The inpainting model?
Which one?
Idk something is funky
Down to 50 ish
It's the one set to 200 or so
Hmm. Turn down the padding
Generate an image first
Looks good to me
Inside that folder
Look for stable diffusion
Inside the models folder
Yup
Just do it on the model you've got rn, shouldn't be much performance difference
on any generation at 512x512 lmk what the it/s is
Cool cool, and when you open the console you'll see some progress bars with a "xx it/s" next to it
Also What gpu are you on? And how many it/s are you getting
Then take that and find your install folder, go to models, then stable diffusion and paste it in there
And click the .ckpt
Ah go to the files section
There's some other settings you should fiddle with but I can't remember them off hand, TMRW I'll send you a list of stuff to fiddle witb
Don't need 100% but it will be better at inpainting
Cool cool, stick with 1.5 for now
You prefer v1.5 or V2?
One sec
Also, you got the inpainting model?
Idk if it's causing issues but try set your resolution to something divisible by 8 and square
What's your mask look like
The background changed?
Yo
are both of those cpap parts available still?
Just @ me if you have problems
Then in the line with "args" in it
Right click and select edit
webui-user.bat file
no
yes

yup, my biggest concern for the printer now is just collisions on the belt path. im gonna try minimalize the base since that uses a lot of filament
i wanna try out that rscs, have you seen 247printings v0, i might try copy his toolhead
awesome, if everything goes to plan this build will be using spares only apart from bearings
upwards?
but meh, more rotational inertia
also might move the motors to the top of the frame, i like having them at the base for weight
yeah im planning on using some spacers under everything in the belt path
awesome! i was gonna switch it all over to use mellow idlers for the bearings, but im lazy so i caved and spent ¬£30 on bearings üò≠
all the rail mounts are adjusted, and the right side of the y gantry in the middle of the top is modded for mgn12h
but
im not proud of tinkercad
hey id be honored if you took a look at my mod, im almost finished changing the y gantry to fit mgn12h, last part is to cut away some bits and adapt the carriage
Cool, I'll give it a try with the 3mf for now
Cool, I'm gonna try port it to mgn12 ü´†ü´† so I ll end up using m3
can i ask, why the m2.5 and not m3?
hm, ive got that all i think, apart from some bearings and rails, time to get modding üòé
im happy to bug test!
thank you!!!
üéâ
just eyeballing it that is, but if you're looking to beta test id love to help. im fairly experienced so just having the cad on hand to view should be enough for me to build it
it looks like ive got most of the parts on hand
hey i saw your rook mod and il be honest, im in love, ive got this week off work and was hoping you might share the CAD
when mikaeli reel
the gantry also hasnt been updated, nor has the height of the belt path in a couple spots (they might not need changing i just havent checked for any collisions)
i can share the stl for the x and y gantry and the top plate (except for the veery uppermost plate which needs to be modified still)
i cant remeber who wanted the mgn12h mod but i figured ill release what i have as of now since i wont be able to work on it as quickly as before
All thats left is to do the upper most part
There's some parts where you'll need a weird screw or just use 3 screw holes
The X and y is finished
ive got 4 functioning holes abnd then to fasten the bearing a screw through a heat insert above the bearing
nah the h or c indicates long or short block
wait can i see what youve done, i think we came to the same solution except mines for mgn12h
plus ive got a clear petg so i might embed a LED or LED strip
im gonna try petg since abs shrinks and i haven accounted for that
with the way its designed theres maybe 4 small sections i can print to test the fit, then itll be up to my printer to handle the large part
eh ill take what i can get
It's almost done  so I'm hoping to have it done by late tomorrow
would someone want to lend hand
im most of the way through a mgn12h mod
yeah i only managed to get the 3mf files. no .step
this is my first attempt at the y gantry, i wouldnt print it just yet
erm, ive been working mainly off the .stl. im not too sure of the bottom parts yet, i know id like to change them for personal use (slim them down and get a big of a stronger connection between upper/lower frame)
Cool, I'll drop a link when I finish, it's not exactly high quality but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
U interested in building or designing?
Yeah I've got maybe 3 parts left to mod

And most of that's in the past week
He tackles me or trips me up so he can grab me (in a hug kinda thing)
Takes my stuff just so he can overpower me trying to get it
Grabs my earlobe and tickles it
Very "straight" behaviour
Pokes my ass with rulers and pens
He insists I need a rear view camera to wipe my rear cause it's so large
Trust
It's not like that
Nah nah we friends so it's chill
Every time I was in front he would scream "God dayumm that's sum gourmet shit, a real nice cut of meat!"
On dofe I wore shorts
Turns to me in math, reaches backward (I sit behind him) and he grabs me thigh and squeezes it and whispers "niiice and juicy"
That's the mild stuff
Every time I walk by he says "God daaamn look at those juicy thighs, those are watermelon-crushing legs"
I wouldn't dare repeat the stuff he says to me with my parents around
I'll have to tell you on call, it's half the way he says stuff and the context, this weekend?

ahh thats sick, someday ill get something approved for the official vzbot üòÑ
thanks for setting up the discounts, how'd you get them?
oh well ü§∑
hm last i used those plugins they could only see channel names and not the contents
just wanted to ask- how was the discount abused?
what parts have to be printed?
That's what she said
Only issue I see is print orientation, you might wanna print those vertical instead of horizontal so that the mold surface is smoother
dang looks nice
8167408535234189
for the kit?
Okay
Vez has agreed to help chip in the money for shipping, would you be able to process the order asap and I'll pay you whatever it costs as soon as I wake up
Hi, can I get a pack with just the 4 460mm extrusions, I'll pay for the fastest shipping available
UK
How fast will those profiles ship?
I'm not sure if anything else is missing from the kit, I'll take a look later today
It's not easy to show on camera, but they are rotated between photos
Yes
None with holes
would you be able to ship the replacement parts to me with fast shipping, my address is:
6 ibsley way
London, England, United Kingdom, En4 9ey
hi, my kit has the 460mm extrusions in layer two missing the drilled holes
Are these likely to sell out very quickly
üôè I'll see if I can find enough money
Also, is assembling the kits in the factory what takes longest or is it building up enough stock to make the kits?
Okay, do you have any estimates for that
Are there no kits
If not, do you have all the parts available just not assembled, I'd be interested in buying all the parts unassembled at a discounted price
Sorry it's been so long, but are there any available
How much does the vz330 kit cost
yes, i just want to double check a couple things before i purchase if thats okay.
how much can i expect to pay to purchase to the UK?
is the vz235 any cheaper?
does the vz300 have the aluminium Z and a lightweight gantry tube?
can the sex mod have a patrick star character
is the cf panel stock?
Not too long to wait pal üòÄ
I'm just happy to register another x69 üòÇ

Click the button and follow the instructions
<#834043767111417916>
Ooh actually there's a couple on the queue
Otherwise I'd offer to do it once we hit 169
Alright so I'm about to board a flight, just say in your ticket that you wanna wait for 169
Gimme 20m
Sure is last I looked
Assembled and shooting plastic

did i get the right one <@692801013039759443> ?
gun
for
it fits snugly in carrying case
stretch to required dimension i prefer 7 inch height and 2 inch diameter
i gotchu dawg
what are those tiny components called
is that the one you must scrape off the bits on top
plz stop it
my ceraliatey under 4 pro max with silencer board is making noise
Not a bother at all, that's funky though. The bot handles naming and roles I'll update it for you and let <@276016956245540864> know
gotta figure out the vibe
im trying to decide if i want to go
or is it a maker fair and theres other people about
are the reprap festivals social events where the happens to be maker booths
I'll do some reading and see what I gotta buy
Does the kit not include all cabling stuff needed
this one? ^
Who would sponsor us, a lot of the parts we use are self made so can't really partner with a manufacturer other than mellow.
would they accept a school lunch card, our school one is pretty barebones
is any chance the tickets sell out, i dont wanna wait and end up not going
Tomorrow I'll grab some tickets, my journey is pretty easy so if there's any random bits I might have that I should bring just lmk
ü§®
I'd take a floor and a duvet ü§∑, not too fussy
Back on the accomodations for sleeping, I'd probably only stay the one night although I'll have to see how my timetable next year (might not have Monday lessons) but I can't spend too much so I may stay at a holiday Inn etc
get him in the thread
If you guys are chill with it I'd be happy to come, possibly with my dad possibly not
I thought it was a Thursday
Well that's school sorted
Hour drive or 3hr on public transport, I'll see what I can do
Being 17 though I don't want to put a tamp on anything you guys wanna do
For 16 quid ü§∑
Though I can always try convince them to let me go
I'll see if I can come but might be during school time

Charging batteries for my flashlights and getting ready for smrff
So if you've got the space for me, let me know how you're getting on and I can either drive up later or with you guys
Okay so if you go the route north of London I can meet you at "South mims" on the  motorway
Ah okay thanks
If you've got space in the car, I could meet you part way
<@451709396280410132> roughly what time does your ferry arrive
i can always try my luck at a club, though i doubt ill pass for 18
dont let me hold you back tho
rip
oh the ID part, 17
why?
i like it
they sound sick
nuh uh?
illl get back to you later if thats okay
i think

yeah north of london?
ah okay, the other route via google maps goes almost past my house
cool, im leaving from north london around 5
about 2 hours iirc, id arrive around 6 ish
Also my mum's going to come with just to meet everyone (not to dinner)
What time are you aiming to eat at
I'm gonna try arrive before dinner and eat with all of you
We can finally use the stage feature

pretty please can i get a "matthew"
yup üòé

nah its cool with me, just giving a heads up so its not a issue on the day
i gotta give you a heads up tho, i am a minor,  so im chill with the room if you are?
Yeah, I'd love a medium
true, may have to drive to the countryside
there is the issue of living under a flight path
but i could add a 12v lipo and a inverter
currently, i only plan to run it off 240v AC
so im hoping to point this up and have my friends be able to see it for miles
i live on a bit of a valley
well
if it helps, a budget/mid price long range flashlight is around 395,000 cd 
hehehe
measuring this lights intensity is gonna be tough unless i can find a ~100m line of sight
we'll see
i hope its around there, the build im basing my numbers off of tho uses a lower power bulb and smaller lens
im hoping to have my UVA 20W light finished and my 450Mcd searchlight complete
ill be carryng 3 days of clothes and a absolute tonne of flashlights
yup, imma take the train from london
awesome ü´°

ive got a old skr 1.4
thanks man üëç  you da best
whats the design?
if thats something everyones up for, im 100% down to hop on call and take inventory and then buy whats needed
but if its a serious consideration to build something there i can bring mine probably, since im only taking a short train ride
ah no, ive only got the kit parts
i have a 330 half assembled kit
if thats a option
Maybe I'm just built different üí™üí™, cause I've flown at least 12 times this year and it's worked every time
The kinda tired that lets you sleep?
Different story for adults I guess
i fly to and from the USA for weeks at a time
its not terrible if you sleep on the flight here start to finish and take melatonin for the first couple of nights
im fairly certain im going, just need to finalise some bits and bobs, if theres anything i can fit in a suitcase for you guys im happy to carry it
Oopsie that was yesterday
Didn't e3d offer one to us iirc
I'm not the seller sorry, <@561385770724622356> is

depends
yup
But for the cheapest price on the ts11- buy from wurkkos.com
If it's a bit much for you, there's some very simple UI that are easier to use
But there's a whole tonne of other settings but the most useful are temp calibration, a set of flashing modes,
And different click sequences will get you different modes, but there's a simple click and hold to adjust brightness and double click for max
So it's called anduril
Ah yeah
Small, USBC, long range for its size, plenty bright, has rgb aux lights, uses a good firmware
Alright, check out the wurkkos ts11
And tell me what of those aren't important
Pick as many of those as you want
Alright, so there's a lot of options, help me narrow it down. Whats important to you: battery life, range, brightness/flood, size, usb c rechargeable, simple UI
For a adjustable one or a cheap, all rounder?

hello!
omg modbot
6 Ibsley Way, Cockfosters, London, Barnet EN4 9EY
Matthew weinberger
Awesome
Is it too late
Omg I'm so sorry i keep missing your messages
Drop that PayPal and I'll send it over
Sorry it took so long, didny see the msg request on mobile
Yep I'm in
except youtubers cause ill remeber them
haha my plan is to greet everyone at smrff like that
ah ive gotten into the habit of greeting everyone with a "hi im matthew" and they give me their name
lemme ask everyone else
üòÇ
yeah we have <#928710955230167070>  but i dont think its a public channel
Awesome üòéüòé
I'd also just really like to get my hands on it fast üòÖ
Awe sick! Unfortunately I have very little to bring to the table other than the grant I get as a student (and my parents are flying to America on the 4th of July so I can send stuff to you (assuming it's done before then)
same fr ü§£ , im paying for frivolous stuff so not as serious but yeah, no moneys
but i could build a uvc l7
ive got a uva l21a
welll
6 ibsley way, en4 9ey, cockfosters london, UK
Matthew smith
07878793588
Thanks
Awesome!
And all is good?
They're both on the way
Mailed üòé
For my measly s21d, but I claimed the battery was a expensive nitecore one
My first few wurkkos was funded by insurance
Oh nice
Ah same. Dropped my job recently
It does look pretty solid
That makes sense then
Ohh gotcha
If you don't mind me asking, how do you afford all this
Ohh
Me too sis. Me too üòÄ
Wait when you said market, you meant flashlight market right?
Or are you having issues selling mods
Ah damn, do you sell off used lights without modding
Hah awesome, money in == money out. 2 new lights on the way
Yup, no rush
Perfect, same details as last time
Do you want the og packaging too or is it okay if I include it inside the box for the brass
Okay, that works for me
Sorry to keep changing up on you
If it's in hours definitely wait a day and a bit
Or til end of day
Is that 72 hours
Earliest it would get to USPS is the 21st btw
Yikeeess
alright im ready for that delivery sticker for the ts10, im not sure if ill be able to get the diffuser printed in time tho, sorry
will do ü´°
my hdd were just for scrap so i didnt mind them getting shaken and prodded
not for the 20 or so flashlights tho
üòÜ  they once stopped me for carrying 34 hard drives in a suitcase
thats ac so smart
ooh i should start doing that
do labels expire?
its quite nice
surprisngly not, ive found theyre super quick and deliver when they say they will
im also passing detroit if thats any closer
FL 33156
yup, one sec
my paypal is matthew@matthewweinberger.com  ü´°
awesome üëç
is that wait okay?
im next in the USA on the 21st btw
all good then üòé
ive got a ton of spare pocket clips, should i include one?
cool, im happy to receive a label and chuck it (gently) into a drop off
possibly, it would be a lot easier to get there via public transport for me. im out of the coutnry from the 20th of this month until the 4th of sept
ill ask around some friends and see if they know anyone nearby who could pick up some batteries
hm, it might be doable but unlikely tbh. i dont have my drivers yet and i dont have any family around there
solid
nop ü§£
they can come by anytime
ty, my address is 6 ibsley way, en4 9ey, barnet, london
about a month, im tryna buckle down and revise üò≠
ive got exams coming up, any chance youd arrange collection
i dont know if ill really be out the house this week
seems fair
16
theyre 4.1
sorry
on mcpcb
oh wait not bare
thats the thickness of the bare LED, idk if theyd let it/
one sec
do it for pickup?
nah
one sec
forgot thats how they work
ah
whichever youd prefer
or if its a letter i can chuck it into a post box
you wanna buy the label for pickup?
cool
shall i pack them in a plastic box and bubble wrap and pit into a envelope?
yeah go on
Damn did they change their product
Nah that's cool, when I'm home I'll spec out a rgbw XML light and get back to you
Also wanted to check, got any hosts?
But my school doesn't do that
Nah, no exams this year thankfully. I'm doing further maths tho so I could do the a level exam now
I haven't applied yet (I'm in year 12) but next year I'll apply to Nottingham and imperial and Leeds probably, idk where else. I'll also apply to America for Northwestern, university of Michigan and university of Wisconsin Madison,
Ooh, I'll shop around
Ooh rgbw for a wk40 maybe, lemme think about it and get back to you
Cool, thank you
I was hoping a little more, like 2 for 8 ish, I wanted to ask tho do you have any interesting LEDs to trade?
yup
what price were you thinking?
cool cool
That sucks that they don't stick it anymore
Yeah, I've got 4, how many do you need
Yeah they're like a few quid each, I might do
If I had a lathe I'd crank out a extender and bend some brass sheeting
Ooh I gotta try
If they slightly slimmed the batt tube walls and used brass sheets then it's the perfect size with a added extension
It's such a shame, a 18650 fits width wise without the brass ring but not length
Nah using the wurkkos stock battery for the ts10 rn
It's not too bad once you've programmed it but it is very odd, the mode group selection still has me stumped
A little bit, between 3 different diagrams ige managed to set the AUX default pattern, set moonlight first, double click to turbo and set thermal limits to 70c
Cool
All good?
To jui Chung Wang ?
22.29 otw
I'm reading wrong
Oh hang on
So it's 6.69 left to pay
Oh wait I've sent 15.60 to you already right?
Alrighty, what's your pp
PayPal?
Hey sorry, not stiffing you. Just thought I'd already replied to let you know I was waiting for payday (tomorrow) but I hadn't hit sent
Ooh sweet
Cool I'll see it in a week or so. Tyy
Is it the 2 day tracked service
Thanks üòäüòä
Yeah that's it
Got the address?
Yep
Sounds good
I really would buy but I'm completely skint right now
I've had worse üòÇ
Oh good, I've never seen a sst20 irl
How's the tint
Ooh it's pretty
Feel free to play around and whatnot, just don't drop it
Yeah go on, lmk how it looks
No it's okay, I don't have the money for a D1 rn.
I'll probably emitter swap that light anyways
Gotcha, I'll get back to you though if it's okay
Hm true, would I be able to buy the flood LEDS from you?
Depending on what's left can I get one
I was hoping to get one fully flowed, I've got a payday coming up and some debts to pay off
Matthew@matthewweinberger.com and 07878793588 ty
May as well add the 30p
Calm that's good for me
Royal mail?
Shipping to 6 ibsley way, en4 9ey, cockfosters london
Ah gotcha
If you have it then tho, you can drop it at my house but I don't mind shipping either
DW I'll be up in Manchester then anyways
cool
yup
if youre able to remove it from the box and stick it in a padded envelope itd drop the cost a lot
cool, just wanted to check which you meant
cool, hand delivery or should i purchase a postage thingy closer to the day
It won't be anything special but it'll be better
You got any ideas? I was thinking ts10 driver off they're the same size
It looks sick ‚ù§Ô∏è
But
Yup the UI is awful
What date do they arrive
Gotta find a driver to swap in
Awesome I'm psyched for the df02
Cool, no problem
I don't think so, I'll see if I know anyone near there but you'll probably have to ship it to me
Ah damn
I don't mind waiting but whatever you and Bagh decide on works for me
Yeah that's fair
Aw man I'm sorry
Oh dear, it did say 48hr to ship
Cool no problems
I think I'll work an extra shift first to justify it
Nice nice, if I order anything more it'll probably be a quad jaxman with amber LEDs and that jinheng c8 style light with sfn60 and whatever random stuff I find üòÇ
Don't stress over it, I can wait till Easter üòé
Cool all done üëç
Friends and fam
Royal mail isn't that expensive
Ooh I'll see but I don't think I can do that late
Mid day?
What time?
The 5th is okay
Right?
4th
Nvm
What do you land
Just the first link
Actually
https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=609813444323
1x green 14500 2700k

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=603693569606
1x 5700k no battery
I'm getting somewhere
Okay I've found something
Yup
I can't find any good deals, the 3x21d is more expensive on taobao than aliex
Not yet
Works for me
Cool
Haha damn I'll need to break out my flashing board
Ah cool, so 20 + cost of d1k and driver
Roughly what price
Oh that sounds awesome
Also wanna combine jlc orders, I've got some CNC bits
What part of the UK are you again
But put my down as interestdd for sure
Depends what host
Ooh maybe I'll pickup a few cheap headlamps and a ts10 idk
Okay I'll get back to you in the morning
What's it cost?
Imma just direct drive it off a 500w 12v PSU üòé
I'd take one of the largest LEDs they have in 12v
Did any of them offer a 12v version
Just so I know, what're you ordering?
Cool cool
if i change my mind tmrw ill let you know but dont wait up on me
hey i dont think im gonna get, cant justify the price rn
ty
cool
ah thats what impulse price is
just wanna check im not seeing a new user deal
is it ¬• 129
cool, ill hit it with some google lens
ah okay
hey woukd you help me read the ui diagram
hehe some security is gonna be concerned
oh yeah, im sorry i forgot about that, i this works out ill bring to the airport
cool i can meet you at the gate unless something comes up
I'll share tmrw, I'm sick and tired of this probe
Even the bed scanning pattern is engraved
But it's fucked up my bed
Nor can i
None
Identical mount
Yep
Change the cable and it decides to become a engraver
Genuinely been using this surface for months with this probe, offset is around .6mm positive
Nope
It must've skipped hard too, because it was printing 2 parts in the front right corner
It ripped chunks up along with the file pattern
It shouldn't be able to carve this deep, the whole point is that the carto knows where the bed surface is
Less than 5 minutes
Not like this
It was crap on 1 and 2
No üò≠ look at the bed
Was on layer 2
Downstairs, I run a fast first layer and switched it off as soon as I got upstairs to see the progress
The usb to the cartographer
A few days ago it's okay, I replace a cable and today I get this
No hardware or software changes
What the fuck
You were right üòÇ
Nope not a dick at all
It was working fine for almost a year üòÇ
My ground wire has no metal in the crimp
Look at the difference
<@295349662607605761> I found the issue
Also does shielding need to connect to anything electrically
Will anything happen if I don't shield it?
Does the cable need to be shielded or have any twisted pairs or anything?
So it's gotta be something in the cable?
The raspi is supplying my usb storage with enough power so I don't think it's a issue
is there any chance of me shorting it and breaking it?
ill check the raspi
yeah
any clue whats going on
<@295349662607605761>
That can't be right
I measure 1.8v across the positive and negative
Came back to troubleshooting after taking a break
ive asked the guy that made this cable for me - if i cant fix it ill just find another long cable or DIY a cable and use it instead
not reallt, its the only cable i have with that connector
mcu 'cartographer': Unable to connect
Once the underlying issue is corrected, use the
Repeatable as in it won't work every time I power on
And why would that spontaneously fail
How do I get it out
This isnt
This is fine
Sorry I mean my main cable
Wdym
It's a right pain to run new ones
Sad stuff
Not grnd
Positive and both data pins are okay
No continuity on the ground
Hang on
Ik ik I slipped üò≠
Continuity
And I checked the cable is okay
Okay no shorts
Now what
Ive re done it
I still can't get it undone
I've got a sucker but no braid
<@172063311058173952> what do I do
Can't get all the solder out of the holes
Pinecil
Nah it's cool that's a pretty crap job
Ah
Yea
Should I power it on a copy the log
Not immediately after but the error is repeatable
Most of the print was spaghetti so I'm pretty sure it wasn't a collision related incident
Just a disconnect error on the last few layers
What points do I probe
Eh?
Make sure there was no contaminants shorting anything
Just doused in alcohol
It happened right after a failed print
No visible damage
No shorts
What gives
I'm getting a can't connect to MCU error
Hiya
Gotcha, and when I run the command should I have manually jogged the bed close to the nozzle?
Use a piece of paper  or a feeler gauge to measure the offset. Once finished remove the paper/gauge and accept the position.

should i be aiming for a tight or loose fit
ü§£
makes me feel fancy ‚ù§Ô∏è , like i own a real v3
oh gotcha
ü§®
brb
will do
this fella right?
yep
reinstall the carto fw?
MCU Protocol error

This is frequently caused by running an older version of the

oh duh, thats such a obvious mistake
sure thing, whole cfg or just relevant parts?

<@1181790237257637938> k do you know the difference between v2 and v3
im getting my friends spare probe and its a v2, i was just wondering how different the v2 is to v3
whats the diff between v2 and v3
ah thats cool
ah okay, were those installed under the circled sections
Are they installed by the coil or on the other pcb
What capacitor is missing
I'll get a V3 with accelerometer built in
Ah well
That's odd
So maybe it did crash but didn't ruin the print
Yeah, but it was only once and it printed fine
I did run a pretty fast print before it errored
Oop üíÄ, no it didn't crash so I'm not sure how the lump thingies by the coil came off
whered they go
i havent had any crashes today
OOOP
lemme check some old pics
oop
<@295349662607605761>  I've got a v1 btw. Visually it looks fine so I've got no clue why it's giving that error
The probe stays triggered and instantly errors out
<@295349662607605761> have you seen this before
Okay thank you üëç
Hey <@1181790237257637938> are you around rn
Probe was working this morning but now it stays triggered no matter what
thats just menas itll go all the way along y then move over obn x and go along the full y and repeat
you can do but i dont think itll make a difference
i dont see much wrong, but ive included my working config for reference <@330479964942106634>
snill can we see a full config file
i think v0 is closer
crikey, tram that bed
thats a motor direction issue
no no, mine are okay. i mean are the prints mirrored as well as the mesh
hey <@330479964942106634> are your prints mirrored too?
no the old joints. this new solder is working right
i think the reason it only happened during printing is the fast movement pushed the wire enough to momentarily disconnect
so far it looks like it
yeah it was pretty bad, i think itll be fine now
yeah, ive used zip ties and it isnt moving during printing so i think its okay
Oh cool, I might be getting a new version soon but rn im stuck with this one. Fingers crossed it works
That's alright sorry to rush you
Dirk what do you think of my solder
They're kinda meh
It's tough to solder these damn
How'd I do
Any clue what the wire is around the edge
One wire fell off üíÄ
Yessir
I'm all good with soldering, so this didn't happen a few days ago so I assume the MCU side is fine since it doesn't move. It'd be the cartographer side that's faulty right
Just wanted to find out if it was a hardware problem
If it's definitely a wire issue I'll go resolder and try again
Yeh, he wasn't too sure
That's what the probe connects through
He built my VzBot kit
100 percent from England
Wdym
Odd if that's the issue that it's only cropping up now
Lemme resolder real quick
Yeah it's a v1
Oh yeah sorry you don't know him, from team gloomy and he's 100 p from England, this is the probe
hang on, lemme check the boards silkscreen and see what its labelled as in the fw, its a v1 iirc
aw what thats funky. i got this from jay, he built my printer and installed it
"IDM sensor not receiving data" or sometimes it says the idm mcu has shutdown. this usually happens mid print and ive had no luck reproducing it normally.
ive tried getting the coil to 80c and scanning - works fine. tried having the hotend heat in case it was interference and it still works. i dont know what else to try
i dont think its a issue with my pi being overloaded, its a 3b but if it is i can try slicing something low res and testing
ty
Wild
Yeah and it worked for a full year üòÇ
I'll give it a try
Reckon I could melt the insulation around there or flood it with solder to get a connection
And I haven't fiddled with it recently
Especially since it's been working for a while now
Not being funny but it looks like the metal part of the wire on the black wire has disappeared
ty
ah sorry about that, yeah its the black one
*because the ground isnt connected
i think its why my beacon has stopped working
hey jay, 
Yeah no worries, it can be tough keeping up with everything
Cool üòé
Hey did you end up posting it?
awesome
Hey I'm all back and settled in the UK, lmk if you need anything from me to get it posted
awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è , ty so much
awesome, ive just landed in florida but ill be back at the end of the week, how much do i owe you?
awesome, thank you
which shipping company did you go with?
awesome, dw if it takes a day or two
awesome
6 ibsley way, en4 9ey, cockfosters, london
yeah theres a connector there, if the pinouts dont match ill just switch around the pins
lemme buy a postage label real quick and send it over, will it fit in a letter?
thank you man üôè
its got the accelerometer too?
are you sure?
dang, do you want my address and then the carto can go straight to me?
ah so next week for the carto but youll be away so you wont be able to ship it?
do you know roughly how long they will take to arrive?
awesome, thank you jay!
awesome, thank you man
hey jay, having more cartographer issues. if its not too much hassle could i get that replacement
Oh then it's some other wire sticking out
Also it happened again, it's not a temp issue but I'm going to try see if it's a shielding issue
Awesome
Dang. 50c chamber, 67c coil temp and it's scanning fine
but if its not too much to ask, could i get one with adxl installed
ty man, im gonna keep trouble shooting since it could be a problem with me not the probe
my chamber hits 40-50c so fast its crazy, not even recirculating or anything
nah the bed scanning is too sick not to use
yeah thats what i was thinking, then it wouldnt have temp problems
i need to get it back on
might just be a sock issue icl
still trying to figure out why
funky. i had to change the rtation distance to 3.6 which is weirdly low vs the stock 4.7 i think and it works decently for ABS at lower speeds like 250ish but not higher
oh could it be a shielding issue, i noticed the cable had it cut off. if i just remove the hotend heating before probing that might sort it
cool, i had some other issues so updated and reinstalled a lot of things, gonna do some more testing. is it the soldering on the board that you think is dodgy?
ive got no clue whats wrong
"IDM sensor not receiving data"
Internal error on command:"PRINT_START"
12:47
Internal error on command:"BED_MESH_CALIBRATE"
12:47
Internal error on command:"_BED_MESH_CALIBRATE"

hi jay, ive been getting an error about the cartographer not sending data when starting prints. is there a max temp i should stay under? it hit 62c
Thanks!
Ah awesome thank you. My last name is weinberger
Still 17
My work experience week starts 8th July and goes for one week, but I'm flexible on the dates. I'm more interested in mechanical engineering but that's a pretty broad subject and I'm not sure about anything more specific
And gimme 10m I gotta go check the dates for that
For the Goliath? I'm not sure it's leaking anymore. I need to spend some time looking at it since it does print alright around 150mm/s but not faster
Hiya
Not quite, I took a break on that but today I'm going to try a acetone soak and PTFE replacement
Hey Jay, I wanted to follow up and ask if you've had a chance to find out if your London office is running a work experience program. If they are would you put me in contact with the right people.
Possibly, I'm going to try and get this one to work but I'll get back to you
thank you man, any size material quality
yea absolutely anything
the thing still leaks, any chance youve got spares?
except the dang nozzle
everything fixed
KAMP?
Yeah I'll need to scour all the cfg files, which one handles bed meshing
Nope
Ah okay
Does that seem like a valid output? The z position before calibration was 4.9
Ah
What am I tuning it for with the calibration, it's giving a range so am I trying to have the nozzle touch a feeler guage?
ive had it work before which is why im stumped, not sure whats changed that would make it stop working now
with the knobs? yeah
used a m4 bolt and a metal file üòÖ  but it works
trying to do PA but im getting a move out of range when doing a bed mesh
fixed the extruder and got a solid first print out
Yeah I'll drop mellow a message
There should be two pins one on the heat the other at the bottom of the lever
Hm that can't be good, thank you
Do you remember if it was there when you built it
A pin is missing
But I noticed
Okay so I tightened the nozzle a bit
If it's that then vez will probably reimburse you for that knowing how he is
Iirc RAC had a hotend where the machining was too deep and it was leaking
I'm gonna let it cool, take off the thermistor and then remove the sock
Looks like it's leaking
That explains the blobs
Oh dear
havent gotten around to it yet but its a 12m video 
ill fix it in the mornin
ah nah was going 300
before i declare the printer faulty and buy something, maybe im going too slow
ah gotcha, what did you find to be too slow
wdym?
though i imagine too long beats too short
ill double check that
thats odd, ive never bought a cht nozzle so no way i mixed them up
oh huh whatd you get
yeah thats what the kit came with, i should probably invest in a nice nozzle
hmmm i was hoping it was just a gap in the extrusion path
did you hot tighten everything?
got some under extrusion and occasionally it pushes out a big blob of plastic
pushed plastic üòé
gotcha
did the rscs go in parallel or series
Yup üòÖ it was on vezs yt about 4 months ago I think
I'll double check later
Might not be
I remember vez posting a vid about it
I think so
Alrighty, I have no reason to think you didn't, but I wanted to check, did you make sure all the steppers were synced. E.g x to x1
awesome
ah duh, ill set up the switch and then ssh, install drivers and use wifi
that might be it, any way to install it without the pi being booted
although its not connecting to wifi with my usb wifi dongle either which is a shame, i do have ethernet in my room but the cable is too short and the plug is behind a wardrobe, might need to install a switch to extend the cable
I'm going to troubleshoot it once I've got the rest sorted, no screen is no biggie
Nah I gave both sides a check and they should be okay
Nah it didn't boot when plugged in, voltage is 5.1 rn
Not quite, got the buck installed and then had to call it quits
It's the least I can do for 32 hours of work, plus the wiring is just so clean
Ah gotcha
Yeah sorry meant directional like that, is there a standard way for them to go?
Buck converter added üòé, are the ribbon cables directional
aw sick! itll take no time at all to have it printing
getting close to pushing plastic, wanted to check what tuning youd done, like input shaper, belt tension, levelling etc
on the search for one now üòÖ
sorry about that
ah that makes more sense
hey jay did you manage to connect via wifi to the Pi, ive uploaded a config for it but it wont show up. wanted to check if it worked for you ever before i go troubleshooting
did you install mainsailos or do it via kiuah?
gonna try pushing some plastic tomorrow and run it headless until next weekend when i can sort out the screen
awesome
yeah we made it üòÖ , the machine is so impressive
hey jay, just to double check, the printer will work just fine with the pi powered off the mobo but the screen will misbehave
Sorry for the wait
Alright, 15m out
ü´° see you soon
On our way, 50m out
More to follow
One sec üòé
Works for me
And my payday is coming up soon so a little extra thank you will follow
That's brilliant, how should I send it?
Ohhh that 90 was a total üòÖ
Cool, 180 total if I added right
Cool, I think I put that kinda time into figuring out the frame üòÇ
How long did it take you?
I'm so pumped to get the machine!
Awesome üòé
Cool cool, I've got a spare buck so thats all good, any chance you'd be able to run input shaper in time. No worries if not
0900 at  M1 J45 Skelton, Leeds LS9 OAS
All good for tomorrow still?
Ah nice üòé
Cool cool
If the printer is ready for it would you run input shaper
Cool üòé
Awesome, any time work better or is either okay
Does  9am or 9.30am at M1 J45 Skelton, Leeds LS9 0AS to swap the printer
Awesome man, thank you!
Just to get an idea of what needs doing once I've got it, has it got firmware loaded on, is it printing ready what tuning if any have you done
Perfect üòé
cool
somewhere halfway between darlington and manchester
hey jay, how does Sunday 11th feb midday'ish work for you
Cool
How are weekends and are you okay with holding onto the printer for a couple weeks
Yeah sounds good, lemme check what days work
Awesome that looks so good
yeah i think a couple motor mounts have the motors rotated 90 deg so theyd come up a little short
That wiring is looking great
Nah don't think so
Cool, thank you
Awesome thank you, and just to be safe I'll desolder that 12v regulator
Does that sound like it'd work
Hey so I fixed all my wiring, it was definitely the z probe which is my bad. On power up everything except the 12v status LED light up. I'm thinking I can just use a buck converter and directly power my probe and only connect the signal wire to the motherboard
no rush üòÜ youve done in a few weeks what would've taken me until 2026
thats some clean ass wiring
aw dude thats so fire
But I'm 90% the fans aren't the issue
Later tonight I'll fix the wiring but I think I had the reverse pin out, I'll do some probing and let you know
Hey I did some more probing, I think it's my z probe tbh
Cool cool, enjoy
Hey any update
I'll tie it to the driver's temp, they do temp reporting right
Controllable please
Alright, thanks man, otherwise my board looks okay visually
Hey jay, sorry to bother you again, I've given the motherboard a look over and I've narrowed my issue down. There's 0 resistance between gnd and pin 3 of IC5 when any fans are plugged in. Do you have any ideas about how to fix it
Thank you tho
I'll come back to it later
Oh dear
And smoky
The wires to my pi were quite hot
Huh really
If it's just for 5v power I can just get a buck converter out
Hey jay, I fucked up my mellow super 5 by accident, shorted the 5v and now IC5 looks charred, I can't read the engraving. Any chance you know it
Cool, thank you for the update üôè
It looks amazing!
Ah thank you üôè
Wait no
All 3?
Ah cool
Which two need bridging
Ah okay
Either I think
12 to 24v
Ah that makes sense
The aliex says there's a HV probe port but the silkscreen says it's for neopixels
Hey jay, working on my cr10 rn, I'm almost finished hooking up the super 5 you gave me, just stumped on where my end stops and inductive probe go
that looks so fire üî•
Thanks man
Ah cool I'll find some later
Are they important for your build?
Oops, might've taken them out by accident
Sweet
What you did on the vz235 was awesome
Sure thing ü´°
Awesome, I was about to ask if you could do that üôèüôè
Ooh no I didn't, is the alu beam compatible with mgn9
Aluminium please
Awesome üòé
Cool cool, there's no rush
Not in a pushy way, just in general
Hey I'd love to see some pics of the printer progress
Oh well
Oh I suppose I coulda put the two into one box
my condolences
Cool, no rush or deadlines so don't stress over it at All
Yeah üòÇsorry for such a long wait
XA2008449
Via parcel force
Hy sorry I forgot to give you a heads up, parcel is on its way to you now
evri refuses to take my parcel, going through parcel2go
ill try rebook it
weird
yeah
is that normal?
huh, evri says your postcode isnt covered
dw, just about tp buy the shipping labels, should be with you before christmas
haha im still working on finding time to pickup a box big enough to ship a half assembled frame üòÖ
cool üëç
yeah, ill include a raspi 3b in the package
Awesome thank you, picking up the box to shop it soon
ty so much üôè
this thing is stressing me out, imma send it half assembled
Hey would you be okay with taking it apart, I might just ship two boxes, one half assembled one with the rest of the kit
I'm gonna try leave as much as I can already assembled, but tbh it all needs redoing
Hey when I disassemble, do you want the screws back in their original bags?
Cool üòé
Ah cool cool
I'll order those din rails thingies for you if you'd like
Yeah of course
Oh damn that's a great price
üëå
Yeah the wire block thingies
Ah cool thanks
What else would you need for the wiring
Awesome, it's gonna look sick!
awesome üòé
amazon.co.uk/OVERTURE-Filament-Premium-Dimensional-Accuracy/dp/B0BNDBFNFK  
this in the yellow (not grass green)
It's a black kit
Awesome
Awesome üòé, what colour do you think you'll use?
Yes please and no handles or braces
nop, colour doesnt matter, print it in whatever colour you want the least
and yes please for that probe üôè
ill get started on disassembling the frame so far and packaging it and then get back to you when its finished
ofc, i worded that kinda badly, but yeah we'll find a day and place that works
so ive got some family in manchester, so i can schedule a visit and collect the assembled printer from around there
huh thats really not too bad, i was expecting much more. that makes it a much easier decision to send it
ive had steak dinners that cost more
i mustve entered the numbers wrong because UPS offers home collection and 3 day shipping for ¬£37!!
so for that, i have family in manchester, so theres a chance i could collect it in person
awesome, how much would i owe you for the build? ill pay for whatever parts arent included in the kit too
hey jay, just sat down to look at shipping for the printer, where in the UK are you?
just one please
ah its alright, im still working my way through school so im sure ill learn about it soon
nice
gotcha
oooh
How??
üíÄ
Idk how else to get 300vdc
So it's gonna be looong
The frame is honestly the hardest part to build, the lens focal length is 24cm and the bulbs focal length is between 5 and 10cm
But for now imma make a huge extension cord
If I want it battery powered I can buy a inverter and use my 12v LiPo to get 240v AC
üòÇ
It would make my life easier but I wouldn't get anywhere near as intense of a beam
180W and roughly 40 Mcd minimum
Needs 325v DC to power the mercury arc bulb
Yup üòé
Yeah it's certainly a fun hobby, I'm partway through the electronics for my searchlight  rn üòé
If you wanna look at some specific builds, check out "enderman engineering" their builds are very outdated and could do with a revamp but are still very competitive compared to what's out there
Budget light forum is where all the juicy stuff is, all the manufacturers and modders hang out there
And the subreddit is pretty good for some low level mods and general stock flashlights
The German forum which has a lot of great stuff 
The candle power forum which used to be really great but has dropped off recently
For general flashlight stuff there's a few forums
thats alright, its not going to run away üòÖ  so lmk closer to the date and ill bring it with
Tool head and some wiring left
And most of the frame is done
The wiring is close to finished
Once you install it just look at the plugin menu and click the tick box
It's through vencord
i got a discord google translate plugin just for this server
haha yup
hey man, figured id finally join this server since i see it crop up in conversations online so often üòÖ
hey üëã
Wow that sounds great, do you guys have London on the map?
Hello üëã

sorry about that
I'm cool with whatever, hit me with a tracking number or updates I don't mind
If that's okay with you that is
I might hit you with another order later but I don't mind if it takes forever to arrive
<@410163261137223704> all good
eaxct same price as usuyal
am i shopping wrong or is taobao 50/50 cheaper/ more expensive than direct from the manufacturer website
e.g the 3x21d, 80 gbp on taobao, 70 on aliex
also, ive noticed some prices are better on aliex
im not sure sorry, already moved on
okay
um
ill see if it comes out cheaper overall but lemme do some research
im off school rn
depending on the day i can take it off you at the gate
also are you flying to heathrow?
no way i could pay you to carry another bag
anywhere else
gonna check convoy
trying to find nichtwatch
are there any stores i should check out, ive got jinheng down
cool
also how do i switch to usd pricing
not on taobao?
hm cant find the magic lishens
So if you wanna put in the work, any dive light in a appropriate form factor would probably work
You can pot it yourself fairly easily, sft40 is something you can swap in easily, UI is driver based
check beamshota tho
Cslnm is much tighter
I have the culpm and it's certainly nice but it's quite a small hotspot
Personally I'd get a sft40 since iirc it's buck
Different LEDs
but id go with sneeze
yeah it looks pretty grim
yup
ah gotcha
cant be that expensive
ive got 2 massive sheets in my bedroom i think
youll see a very sharp cutoff wherre the UV is blocked
you can check it with your glasses and a bit of GITD material, cover half with the glasses and half without
i wear mine outdoors in sunlight every day and theyre okay
nah, i havent noticed any impact on my glasses from it
nop
you see so much more all at once
its great for properly exciting things without needing to be so close
my prescription glasses work
oh no just anything poly carbonate will do
It's worth it tho
My lil bro switched it on without once to charge a GITD toy and got a headache
And never ever use it without glasses
Not a lot of backscatter since the air doesn't reflect it but if you shine it on bedsheets for example it killlsss
Beware it needs a fairly high drain battery
I'll upload a nice catalogue in a sec
Yep, everything glows a super powerful blue
It's hard to expose it right, but both parts of the wall are visible irl at once
Hey <@446409119998410762> wanna see it in action
Oh yeah lemme dm
Gonna be awesome
I'm so excited
Aww yissss
Yup üòÇ
Can I get back to you on Monday and the fine details
Ah gotcha, I'm up in Manchester so I was hoping you'd be on the way back to London and I could hand deliver üòÖ
What part of the UK are you in?
Pounds
Want beamshots?
I got my pricing from sakowuf
Cannot remember the exact quote but I think about 115
L21A 9 die yingfeng UV, zwb2 filter, 12v convoy boost with modded driver for higher current (2.1A with the UV LED)
i have a good uv thrower
pretty please
or meee
There's a couple artifacts in the graph that are from me actually üòÖ
plus the LED which sakowuf will sell ya for about 25 usd CONUS, theres a slightly lower power version on aliexpress available too
aliexpress.com/item/1005003023770134.html
aliexpress.com/item/1005003366620488.html
ah gotcha, lemme link you some bits
its a custom sorry, but id sell it or guide you through recreating it
filter and lighted switch installed
l21a with 9090 yingfeng UV LED and the convoy 12 group boost driver
ah cool, emisar d4k, wurkkos ts25 theyre like the e75 but in a different font
wait do you want a light like the e75 in almost all aspects that isnt the e75?
emisar d4k?
Passports and IDs are neat
With a bad multimeter I estimated 2.06 so I assume it's just over with soldered wires instead of multimeter probes
Ah nice
I also wanna try overdriving the LED
Yeah 2A is almost the max for this guy's anyways, have you measured current through the LED
Tho I could set the floor and ceiling to 150 in andurol maybe
My biggest draw to the Simon boost is I can select 100% only
How's hanks boost Vs simon
Itd help runtime
Nvm boost drver
I'm still hoping there's a 2x 21700 light with a buck driver
The 9090 yingfeng and a convoy boost driver
It's got good range
I can offer you a UV L21A
Still hunting for UV
got a short biopic of how you did it
DAMN
I think so, the acebeam one has USBC charging in the cell
Dedomed 519a, measures 4500k iirc
No scratches or sign of use since it wasn't used
I'll sell ya mine
Rider Rx ti
At least when 3d printed
Nah it's a nice gold brown
And mega tough
PEKK would look pretty sweet
nice
ahh that makes sense
they look so even
what tools did you use to get the right bends and general profiles
oh sweet, that makes sense, its a solid way to get aluminium
it looks awesome
digging that diy gantry
Ooh that ss one looks good
And by large I mean like mt90 size
Idk what might show up, but just in case
Hey paddy, can I ask a favour, if you see anything on eBay that's large and reflector shaped, lmk
Ah well
Reverse search, found it on blf and tlf via way back and then found some look alikes via amazon
I'll find the link in a bit, watching TV rn
Reverse image Searching and some sleuthing led me to a review video, it only showed the battery contact for a brief second but it looked like it could have a retaining ring
No way
Christ
Ah cool
If you model it I'll print it in a couple weeks when k get my new printer
I've taken to using a soldering iron and a solder blob to hit 150c so nothing reflows itself and then trying to unscrew
Have you tried heat
But another rotary can't hurt
Can't afford the pineapple
Oooh
An led and a Arduino?
will do ü´°
Awesome üòé

awesome, so im visiting next weekend it turns out
all good, ill just swap in a new plug
hey to double check, the power brick is included? and it works on 220V too
idm if you wanna wait til later when youre on a pc to sort the details
i stick to desktop
haha yup
yo
np
You can reach out to sitrelenby to get a custom build if you want
Nothing that comes to mind
Like custom build stuff?
Changes to what?
Hey I'll be 1m and I'll drop the hex
Yeah there's no glue in the wk40
Should be, now that it's just the switch and boot it'll probably fit into a letter, probably about a dollar
Cool, so you'll get a omron switch + rubber boot
Eh if that's the case I'll go install cash app dw
And do you want the switch desoldered or would you like it on the convoy pcb
Also no cash app unfortunately
Ah alright, so I can buy the shipping if you'd like, just drop me your address and I'll let you know the total cost
Also do you want the switch desoldered from the convoy board
And then on the weekend is when I can ship it
To make it easy, you buy the shipping label and drop it here, and in the morning I'll double check the cost for the switch and then you PayPal it?
alright i wrote a message and pitched it to the group üòé
my school should have enough irons for us all
the group is all 16-17 rn
cool, ill pitch that to the group, i could guide them through that pretty easily
i like the look of that but i cant find much in terms of explicit instructions. which would be fine for most but the group are really underskilled
probably one of the dual fuel 14500 sizes and a nimh
convoy 12 group driver in either 100% only or 1,10,50 group
thank you so much
80ms aint that bad, im arranging the pay now
cool
oh duh that makes sense
cool, can i drop that into command prompt and use "ping nyc-02.springracks.com:2001 1.20.4"
I‚Äôm extremely committed to a career in engineering and work in and out of school to realise this goal. In school I run a weekly engineering club where I teach basic skills to my peers, by the end of the year I hope for everyone to have completed one personal project incorporating 3d printing and PCB design. I also participate in the Jewish Women‚Äôs Aid initiative at my school. At home, I operate a workshop from my bedroom, equipped with two 3d printers I built: a VzBot and a ZeroG prototype. I was integral to the creation of the vzbot development team two years ago and have helped cultivate an online community of ten thousand people. Recently, i attended the first Sanjay Mortimer RepRap festival in oxford with the vzbot team where we ran a booth, which was an incredible event. We displayed the Vz235 which we recently released a full kit for, and it was exciting to meet the vendors I dealt with online to help bring this to market. I was awarded an Arkwright scholarship for my design and creation of a pultrusion machine which takes plastic water bottles and turns them into 3d printable filament. At home I continue to work on a variety of projects, most recently a high-powered searchlight. I leverage my skills in high power flashlights, which I sell on a commission basis. So far, I‚Äôve earnt ¬£300 in profits from this work. I reinvest this into expanding my personal flashlight collection.

ty, i did hear just had to say gn to parents

I picked engineering project six as my first choice due to my prior engagement in project documentation and design, albeit at a hobbyist level. while I have developed my skills in fabricating parts for home use through using my 3d printers (two I built myself, one I bought) and hand tools. I recognize that technical drawings and following pre construed standards is important when working in a non-personal project environment. though I currently have no experience in this I am excited to learn more and work at a professional level. what jumps out at me about project six is the approach of going from a first concept to a completed proposal backed by calculations. though I currently have no experience in this I am excited to learn more and work at a professional level.

I am excited to engage with professionals at RAL to develop my technical and interpersonal skills in engineering. I have an extensive background in hobbyist level engineering research, design, and fabrication. while I am proud of my past work, I recognise the importance of following established practices in my projects and I am excited to learn to follow these alongside the professionals at RAL. this opportunity will provide a chance for me to expand my skill set and create contacts within the engineering sphere. I am committed to honing the skills necessary for successfully executing projects and collaborating effectively in team environments.
<@755100594884313208> rn
in engineering project 7, Im excited to hone both my technical and professional skills during this work experience. Effective communication, especially across language barriers, is an important skill to me as many of my projects require collaboration with international contacts. Additionally, I'm eager to navigate problem-solving scenarios within specified design constraints. While I have experience with hand tools and 3D printing, including building two printers myself, my exposure to metal manufacturing is limited. Therefore, I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to broaden my knowledge in this area.
I chose Engineering Project 6 due to my prior engagement in project documentation and design, albeit in a hobbyist realm. What sets Project 6 apart for me is its approach, spanning from initial concept to a complete proposal within a condensed timeframe of a week or two. While I have developed my skills in fabricating parts for personal projects, I recognize the importance of technical drawings, an area where I have almost zero experience. Thus, this project presents an exciting opportunity for me to delve into technical drawings, a skill I am keen to develop further, and to work on documentation at a professional level.

Construct an RS NOR latch using two blocks and two redstone torches. Place one redstone torch on each block, and then connect them with redstone dust.
Connect the output of the daylight sensor to the Set (S) input of the RS NOR latch. This means the RS NOR latch will be set (outputting power) during the day.
Delay Circuit:

Connect the output of the RS NOR latch to a repeater.
Place four repeaters in series, adjusting their delay settings to introduce a delay equivalent to two Minecraft day-night cycles. Each repeater adds a delay of 0.1 seconds per notch on the repeater.
Connect the last repeater's output to the Reset (R) input of the RS NOR latch.
Operation:
During the day, the daylight sensor outputs a signal, setting the RS NOR latch and turning off the torch connected to its output.
The signal travels through the delay circuit, taking two full day-night cycles to reach the reset input of the RS NOR latch.
After two cycles, the signal resets the RS NOR latch, turning on the torch connected to its output.
This torch provides your desired output signal every two day-night cycles.
Make sure to test and adjust the delay circuit to ensure it aligns with Minecraft's day-night cycle properly. You might need to fine-tune the repeaters' delay settings to match the timing precisely.
You can achieve this using a combination of redstone components in Minecraft. Here's a design for a redstone circuit that outputs after every two Minecraft day-night cycles:

Daylight Sensor: Place a daylight sensor to detect the day-night cycle. This will be the input to your circuit.

RS NOR Latch (Reset-Set Latch): Construct an RS NOR latch using redstone torches, redstone dust, and blocks. This will store the state of the daylight sensor output.

Delay Circuit: Implement a delay circuit using repeaters and redstone dust. This will introduce a delay to the signal so that it only activates once every two cycles.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

Components Needed:
Daylight Sensor
Redstone Torch x2
Redstone Repeater x4
Redstone Dust
Building Blocks (such as stone or wood)
Circuit Design:
Daylight Sensor Setup:

Place the daylight sensor where it can detect the day-night cycle.
RS NOR Latch Setup:

this too
if this works i wanna add some of his mods
so after i have dinner ill port erything with new mods
<@573949124530012220> i think i can copy all the player.dat files
this for teams
and this lets everyo0ne build wherever and travel to eachother
i wanna try it out
samuel suggested this
idk if theresa way to port player inv
welp
i preloaded a few thousand
pretty much any new mods at this point
thats gonna need a new world bro
<@573949124530012220>
does it add new ores?
what mod is that?
still stands, no point paying for the same thing
ok?
form no?
no you said you didnt mind
plus i thought about it, no point paying for a server just to play vanilla. id rather have cool biomes
so its gonna need a new world
because now you were okay with having it??
terralith apparently
joey chsnged his mind on a couple mods so gonna have to gen a new world
might need to reset
dont get too invested

gimme a bit
ive got the mods working
they didnt work great
nah changed from springracks
but i cant find a way to launch with that command
and it says use "java -Xmx2G -jar fabric-server-mc.1.20.4-loader.0.15.6-launcher.1.0.0.jar nogui" to install it on startup
ive found a fabric installer on their website
hey
thanks man
ty
oooh
this is optional
remove dynmap and sodium and replace it with the following
this is for fabric
this mod pack includes a lot of optimizations as well as game improvements
for shaders you need iris
ill upload here, you can use polymc or curseforge to get mods. unzip the file and upload the .jars to /mods
i got a tutor in a sec so ill do it tonight
nah theres probably a way to do it with the files
@everyone final modpack, lmk asap if theres anything more you want before we settle into this world

No worries
cockfosters tube station - right end of the piccadily line
Yeah that's perfect thank you
Forgot to give you the heads up, but we're here, I'm in a red Wisconsin badgers hoodie
Awesome, I'll let you know 10 or so min before we're there
My friends are less keen on leaving the station, would you be okay with meeting us at the deptford bridge DLR
Cool, I'm with a couple friends, we'll head over soonish
Cool
Whichever you'd prefer, but I don't want to take up your day. What time works best for you?
Ah cool, I'm in and around central today, if you're up for it I can stop by you
Hey jof, did you end up going into work?
Awesome üòéüòé
Awesome, and depending on how the day goes I could pick it up from yours. Thank you so much üôèüôè
Yeah I'll be out and about in London, if it isn't too much effort would you bring the 0.6mm nozzle
I might be near goodge street tomorrow but I'll let you know. sorry about that
Ah dang, I'm at work so I can only reply when I'm on a break, sorry about that
That would be awesome, I'm over in EN4. I know it's a big ask but would you meet me half way around kings cross or so. Id understand if you cant
hey jof, sorry to reach out so randomly. i think i remember you living in london right? ive just got my vz330 kit built but im out of spare nozzles and mines sprung  a leek. any chance i could come pick one up off you as itd be faster than waiting on shipping
i cant access the log files since i get errors when trying to connect
sorry i dont have any useful information. no updates, no hardware changes. only change since it worked 12 hours ago is that i rebooted it and the ethernet switch i use

ive got a f360 student license
im actually going to shiiiit on the competition
im going to thicken the walls a bit and then use this
i can weight optimize it down to 40g using this i bet
did you see my bridge that held my body weight
genius idea
<@544931397048205312>
Hey snake, that 3x21d driver you said you were working on, do you know roughly how long until it's complete? If you remember that grant I mentioned a while ago for students who want to make PCBs this would be a good use I reckon, in which case fab becomes almost free
I was running a old v1 cartographer so it's not all that sad it died, when the new one arrives it has a adxl onboard so I can rerun IS with it
Ty
New ones on the way
My probe died for no reason
No, BUT I will
Kinda, I gotta figure out my two part limit
And in that centre pocket it'll be a reinforcement printed with layer lines going top of bridge to bottom of bridge
I think I'll go for compression
Also should it be arc faces up or down do you think
Oh true, how can I change it to improve that
its meant to be compressed, so the curve is facing downwards
ignoring the fat pocket cause itll be filled later, how does this look
Slight delay
So I have a new one in the mail
The usb I use to boot the raspi off of died üòÄ
yeah
its printing now so ill test the better print soon üòÑ
only had two entries. and one was mine which helf my full weight
nah its cool. still gotta tune the printer
hang on, let me reprint and see
i pushed pretty hard
gonna break this bridge and reprint
bad news, i snapped a section of truss by accident and the non supported overhangs look kinda mehh
good news. all supported overhangs look great and the bridge feels sturdy in hand
i have some good news and bad news
alr print finished in 40m
Alr I'm at school not, GTG but I'll send the pics and test later üëç
Yeah I have a cr10 that I've got the same opinion on. No point messing with it
Got it on a wood chest of drawers that's bolted to a wall
Mine used to be but I upgraded recently
Have you seen Monica mcwuffs 1:59 benchy. I think her printer base was a e3
Ooh nice
That's fair
1 hour 20m but SS overestimates by 25% usually
Damn bruh
Cya
I'll either test in 40m or in 7 hours
And the road has all the infill
But yeah the bottom was bridging like you say
Sorry just left the house
every section except the road part looks to be solid walls
it looks like they dont, im using arachne so it thickens my line width in some spots to be solid instead og gap fill
want the gcode?
the 8g supports is just cause i go a bit denser on my supports than need be
yup
the bridge weight is just whatever it weighs right before testing, so no supports included
no it comes under your 40g estimate
the overhang section is really smart, cause its curved itll print nicely i reckon
42g -8g support
Awesome I'll print it off and we start testing in a couple weeks
Just drop a 3mf or STL or obj before 7 am or I'll print it after 2pm
Good luck man, I'm off to bed but I'll print it in the morning if it's done
Yeah 7mm is fine really
Either is okay
Yeh
Just to follow the competition spirit
Could you route a single wall across the base of the arch?
If it's less than a few mm change in height it's fine really
Top curve?
Which part is the road surface?
ü´° I saw someone say it's a alt, how do you know
yeah its soldered on there its just odd i cant reproduce the problem unless its mid print
oh dear
thats fair, just figured they would know whats up, i was given the probe for free and i really cant afford the real deal so theres not a whole lot i can do
theyre sending me a spare v2 since theyre upgrading to v3 now
thank you for the offer but dont worry, i got it for free from a friend so i dont have a order number
I'm not well versed in mmus, does it require a buffer for each spool as well
I've got the CNC üòéüòé

What's it close to?
Plus I was hoping for something larger, my grandparents are very frail and I worry they'd struggle with a 14500 light
Isn't it a different voltage
Would it take a lithium primary?
As long as it'll have a good run-time
But any lithium primary would live as long I assume
I just picked cr123 because of the shelf life
My grandparents live in a apartment building right next to the sea.

They currently have a single light running on 3 AA, whats a super simple, one click, waterproof, cr123 flashlight.

I need it to either have a small gitd feature or a trit so they can find it.

Cri and tint don't matter
I like the pink filter

its the first one ill ever build - but id like to do carbon fibre
ive settled on this design for a rocket id like to build

Oh piss. You were just kicked so you can just join right back. Really sorry about that
cause we mightve ben a bit swift on that kick

<@903656218831228928> hey that message in vzbot
im on a newly made server so no one other than me and my friend (both noobs) we have copper swords and keep getting killed by monsters. the quickest kill we got was with a stick of tnt. otherwise we got one-shotted and have to respawn
Deeper
What am I doing wrong or how do si get deeer
So I'm fairly new and can't get past level 3 without dying. Also lost my backpack at level 4 but can't go retrieve it cause I die
how can i gte my bag back
ive been playing in a private server with a friend and ended up dying near spawn but i cant get back there without dying, i think
Otherwise I'm out of ideas
I'm going to check later at night when it's dark that there's no arcing
In the electron gun I see a weak orangish glow and I can hear a faint whine
The terminal is booting up as it beeps but nothing happens on the screen
I don't get any image on the screen tho
I've found the horizontal deflector coil, I've put a resistor in place for the board so it thinks there's still something there and I've hooked up a amp to the coil
But I can't get it to work
This is tangentially related to CRTs, I found a wyse terminal 4 in a bin and I want to use it to show audio waves like a oscilloscope
<@&520686645540814848> pee see and NTSC please
id like to send my save game to my friend while im away so he can keep playing without me. will he need the .sav and .mod?
cant remeber if it was market expansion or a restart that fixed it but its all good
hello
cool, brb
either way, didnt see the sale on epic. its ¬£5, itll work with the epic games version right?

anyone know how to force klipper to think a stepper is homed even though it isnt
thanks <@804274061445300255>
it wokred!
silently moved on, lemme try the install again now
this is after uninstalling klippain
i tried. i know what symlinks are. no clue what a dangling one is or why it exists
all good
how can i fix this issue when trying to install
thank you
oh gosh, howd i miss that
so klipper.elf ----> firmwareeee.bin
to move onto my sd
so i should see a klipper.bin right?
lemme go try sd card install now
ive pretty much been fumbling uphill the entire install process
im using a funny fork of klipper so theres no examle configs or docs for this version
oh its the creality v2.4.1 in a cr10s pro
yup and it made the klipper.hex.elf file
no reasonable limit
cool mines at 1 million rn
oh so theres no limit
also how would i set that in config as not an axes but just a stepper to drive
not a continous move but rather multiple really long moves in one direction
can the stepper have limitless movement
huge ass fan
also anyone know if you can just put a jumper over a enstop pin without angering klipper
ive got a bag of spare mosfet chips from assorted electronics
does klipper care if a endstop is instantly triggered
thanks, if i can get this board to heat a 20w heater and spin a single motor and turn a 6w fan then ill be a happy lad
everything else is recycled
so far cost is 7 gbp since i didnt have a usb cable
im on a mission to build a filament extruder only from recycled parts
unfortanutely im confined to this board
just wrong directions and such a pin might require being inversed
there shouldnt be any wrong pins
cheers, so most issues i run into can be fixed without re writing the config
yeah just they didnt specify which board they had
could someone share their klipper config for a v1.1.4 melzi board
Yup, just added it, thanks for the change
I'm a bit of a dummy then, I copied and pasted every announcement, ah well
Nice. After seeing the last notification post Reflash I thought it Would be nice to have it in the servers I moderate
Cheers, into the vzbot server it goes, how'd you do that so quickly?
If not is it possible to make one, i know its a lot to ask but im trying to integrate as many server annnouncments into one channel
<@!286949943632068609> / <@!204642074732134400>  not sure which one to ask but is there a proper announcments channel that can be 'followed'
alright, so normal install and set it as a second board
please @me if you respond
assuming i already have a working setup
if i were to flash klipper on to a second board (config is already taken care of) how would i flash klipper to the new board
Thanks
E.g when my stepper gets too hot a fan turns on
How Do I link a thernistor to a fan
a small part of tape over the 5v pin on the usb end will fix it
does anyone know the pin for the beeper on a skr 1.4 (please @me in the response)
is it normal for my printhead to move slighly with highest sensitivity on sensorless homing
sorry for caps lock
MY END STOPS CONSTANTLY REPORT BEING TRIGGERED EVEN THOUGH IM ON SENSOR-LESS HOMING AND THE PRINT HEAD ISN'T NEAR THE EDGE, IT MOVES JUST FINE BUT ALL END STOPS ARE TRIGGERED EVEN IF I CHANGE THE SENSITIVITY TO 10 (OUT OF 255)
thank you
im using the skrv1.4
found it its under my display, i just used what was already there, do you know where i could find the right pins fr the stock ender 5 display/ender 3 display
ill go through all the pins and check, or is it one pin to look for
Unknown value 'PA3' in enumeration 'pin'
This type of error is frequently caused by running an older
version of the firmware on the micro-controller (fix by
recompiling and flashing the firmware).
Once the underlying issue is corrected, use the "RESTART"
command to reload the config and restart the host software.

Its the default ender 5 display (similiar to ender 3) it only does this when plugged in to exp1 and cn3 and the board and lcd respectively
Printer lcd only lights up and plays a high pitch tone on powerup
check all your cables, i had one installed wrong and causing a short wich stopped it from booting
i see, thank you so much, youve practically carried my entire firmware build
oh ok, its a board thing, i thought it was a driver thing
diag_pin: ^PA1 so this is the right pin i think
no i cant find one, i dont think the actual driver has one, otherwise i cant find anything that mentions the right pin
'tmc virtual endstop requires diag pin config' how do i fix this error
ohhh, i had it as abz, so i change it to x y and z- thank you
nah im using corexy
alright

hi all, took a month long break and came back to a very unstable airlink, it switches from a smooth and coherent stream to smeary and stuttery and then the headset disconnects from the wifi and i have to restart my game :sigh:



pc spec: r5 3600, rtx 3060ti, 16gb ram, 1gbit ethernet port (steam vr shows frametimes of 4-8ms depending on what game im playing)

headset: quest one (stock)

router:archer c6 fiddled with settings, connected to the 5ghz radio only, channel width 80mhz, channel 36, used a wifi analyzer and theres no overlap
check its enabled
in graphics
this cant be seen inside the headset
in the recording the blocks and sabers stutter like crazy
forgot chroma
nvm
hi i get a black screen as soon as i start a song
how do i organise my songs into folders/playlists
you?
kinda is, games unplayable with the latency, is there a more appropiate channel
My oculus quest airlink connection is stuck at 20-30mbps
I've tried everything I can think of
Cable isn't the bottleneck
Router shouldnt be
Ports arent
Settings in oculus arent
Drivers are up to date
Using a BT home hub 4 (not connected to internet) and a quest 1
Forced 5ghz
On my home network I get 56 or so mbps
how do i set up sound replacer
how can i organise and use playlist images on pc version
i it doesnt work
can someone help me, ive come from quets where syncsaber was working but from what ive read it seems its outdated for pc. is there a tldr or guide for insdtalling
and how do i arrange and organise my folders
one last question, does sync saber (from the quest version) work on pc
cheers
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, thought you meaant appdata. im a little slow
like the tricksaber one
just like clicking through and reading any and all configuraition files for mods
cant find it, is there anywhere else it would be?

where do i find the config files for mods?
cheers

hey, looking for a someone with a resin printer to make a couple parts, ill take any colour and resin. i just need two parts to hold a bulb, max dia of 80mm, its two rings + some mounting features
looking for something high temp that isn't load bearing and is accurate
Hey does anyone here go to the university of Birmingham
shiz
nope
id just like to drill a hole honestly, no need to do dt 6th form. although i might
yeah thats the plan, looking for a nice 6th form now
nop, kinda figured if they can have sports they can have for science too
yup
been asking since before covid
and head of year
already tried
also school isnt poorly funded, its in a nice area
20 replies on a teams post in a obscure channel
my swchools statement on being science specialist. the math department is 5 desks sitting back to back in a tiny side room
nothing local. also the school brings in pupils from across the city so local spaces wont do
a science or engineering club that provides support to student projects or a overall project that the entire club works on
yup
210 per year and 7 years
they still do
ive been through 4 teachers now and requested a club each time, still nada
all im asking for is a single science club
10
he was with me when we asked
no but my friend does and its a joint project
to get a minimum of a science club
im collecting statements from other similarly aged people so i can point out how crap my school is being
tried asking to use the drill press and a teacher shut the door in my face
or even a science/emgineering club
my schools supposedly science specialist but has no support for any student projects
please @me  in any response
e.g access to a cnc, drill press, bandsaw
hey all uk students, hows your schools DT facilities
cheers, will they accept volunteers
i dont think theres many near london
i can fill either easily but figured i would do something more fun
ah fair enough, guess until im 16 ill stick to charitys also its for either volunteering or skills
y9
parts that were binned, nothing like a free part from the workplace, if a board fails or something isnt up to standards then i would take it if offered
yup
please at me in a response: does anyone know of somewhere that produces 3d printer parts or works with 3d printers or even assembles 3d printers that a 14 year old could volunteer at (for DoE) or intern at. i mostly want the experience and to work in a professional environment with professional parts (and any rejected parts i could take home and fix up)
@me if you want 1-2kg of scrap filament for a filament extruder, its not proccesed but there's lots of it and all I ask in return for it is 1kg of plastic (recycled) it's sorted by color and batch (mostly)
the eryone tpu isnt terribly soft but surprisingly not very stringy

Drill
Do I still it out
My m3 nuts dont fit in my v2.2 toolhead where you conect the plate to the quick swap hotend holder thing
so sorry
your right
no wait, never mind
i think ive got the wrong parts, well thanks for the help- sorry i was a idiot
the linked manual ends before its fully built
i have printed the parts for the 2.2 toolhead but cant find a manual, can someone point me towards it
cheers
can someone point me towards the v2.2 toolhead or github
so it would be run from unknown sources and files uploaded via pc?
Ahh, would launching it though a app fix it or is there no way to know (also how does bmbf do it)
isnt that how bmbf mods beatsaber, so corect me if im wrong but a sidequest esque apk loader would allow you to mod that game, also ive seen a few file managers for the quest so if thats an issue for modding a quick sideload would fix that
not cd keys?
anyways, where can i buy a windows key
i guess we dont like miners eh
lol itll arrive before my pc
yeah im going with the WD
will these be faster or just more storage for less
thanks for the hel[p
oh cool
ah, i cant send shortened links, alright then
gimme 1 sec then
would you like a list of the 4 im looking at?
id like to stay under 50 GBP
<@!261970289737465857>  about to try some more mods, still unsure why it shows in cutscenes but not gameplay
<@!261970289737465857>  the mod texture shows up in cutscenes unless rico dresses in white for a cutscene or two
Ik it's badly reviewed but I'm really enjoying it, I'm very confused Abt how it works and progression could be a lot more clear but I still do enjoy tossing on some music and blasting the shit out of civilization

is there something i might be missing
hm indeed
heres what the dropzone folder of jc4 looks like
mods dont work
yah no dice
cool
<@!261970289737465857>  do i move the contents of the dropzone folder from the download or the entire dropzone folder in the download

Does the game feel permanently slow after playing for ages, I just got off a 5hr run and at the start it felt like I could sprrriiiiint but now I feel sluggish
I'm on the 4th outpost, where the fricking is the exit bruh üò≠
At the end of the dungeon should I be losing all the weapons I picked up?
5m üòé
21 for me?
nuhh that was 2 years agoo üò≠  üò≠
aw kiwi doesnt have a interface, bobovr then?
is stock that bad? for comfort or hygiene?
have you tried the q1?
god no, the q1 is heavenly but my head goes numb so fast on q3, i feel like the strap doesnt go far enough down my head. the arms wont angle enough
oooh my new quest 3 arrived, whats a good headstrap for it? i bought it specifically for BaS im so hyped!!!
in a dungeon
random water splash effect in a doorway
Everything else does, just dungeons get stuck
Does Carl have something for specifically dungeons not loading
cheers
ig the big issue was steamvr plummetting my frames then
alright
oof
it just seems weirdly high 7gb used
yeah
3060ti and 6gb ram
also steam vr using 60% gpu right until it crashed
is this normal???
also on beatsaber- a very not demanding game
my flatscreen preview is always veery choppy
how do you guys get such smooth recordings
on the emnesia server
oh i see, thanks for all the help. adding links was very usefull
do you know if it works with total game overhaul (sectorys replacement)
what mod makes npcs survive limb removal
hi all, took a month long break and came back to a very unstable airlink, it switches from a smooth and coherent stream to smeary and stuttery and then the headset disconnects from the wifi and i have to restart my game :sigh:



pc spec: r5 3600, rtx 3060ti, 16gb ram, 1gbit ethernet port (steam vr shows frametimes of 4-8ms depending on what game im playing)

headset: quest one (stock)

router:archer c6 fiddled with settings, connected to the 5ghz radio only, channel width 80mhz, channel 36, used a wifi analyzer and theres no overlap
i had 70+ on u10
thats lightly modded
for quest 1
for people who have prescription lenses, where did you buy them (uk)
What happened to the Nexus feed bot
anyone know if you can equip custom avatars in u11
Magic. And lots of fanagling
The other sticks to a vanilla vibe
One heavily modded to make me OP
I have 2 separate installs of BaS for this reason
heres another clip of the big hens
why are they so big
can someone help, my chickens are broken
i can wait
ah well
Is there a way to beta test blade a sorcery,  I don't mind it being ultra broken I'd just love to see the new graphics and mechanics or do I have to wait
So how do I delete my save file for B's I think it's that's causing infinity load times. I've removed all mods and it still is broke
Last night I spent 40m waiting for it to load
I can hear the book if I try open the option menu
Can someone help. My game is stuck in the loading screen (the orange circle)
Well best delivery I can do is 3 days and no refrigeration. The pig comes alive and with a DIY slaughter kit. The pig can be pre pulled if you want
i can go on exploting them then
phew
cause i kinda have been killing both
can you forge allegiances with thre tower/reclaimed or in the end do you stay solo
Oopsie
Is day 12 far in?
And finally that lady that asks for supply's in return for loot, if I killed her will I get to exploit here for resources again?
Also guns aren't nesecary are they cause I really hate them
Thank you
Cool
At the end of the catacombs at the graveyard area will I get the code for the safe from the story or is that a side mission thing
Thanks guys
Cool
Do I go inside the house behind where I met may or is it inside the tunnel towards may
Poggers
Yup
Yeah
Or how to get there
Hey I got the flow regulator but I have no clue which church they're talking about
thats the scariest
if a zombie grabs your arm it whips you ROUND AND plays loud music
Pleas help
Just uninstalled and will try reinstalling later
I shot the tutorial guy and went through the door and listened to the guy at the camp fire and now it's black screening
Just bought the game and think I broke it
Especially with the most recent update
I've had my quest for 2 year and I'm debating whether to finally get this game or noy
I know your opinions will be a bit biased. But would you wholeheartedly recommend this to a fairly experienced VR user
Would you guys consider adding a deadzone to the Controllers since I find myself drifting away from conversations and then having to restart them
On quest 1 btw
Just tried deleting and reinstalling but I'm waiting on it now
Even after restart
And now nada
Got a black screen after killing the tutorial guy accidentally and walking through the door. I listened to some dudes story at a campfire
pcvr
is there a guide showing how to take a scamn of someones face and import it into a character in BaS
the red undelrined ones are where i put misbehaving mods so that they dont get loaded
ill post my mods in a sec
this only happens in dungeons and happens to every NPC
was working a week ago or so but it mustve been a mod i added, only happens in dungeons
halp
limbs wont fall off
how can i edit a mod to make a weapon have more knockback and damage
has anyone else had luck with it
hey <@557691979996332032> gonna get another scan tomorrow, would you like any specific pose?
Would it be a NPC too or just something the player can wear <@557691979996332032>
The scan is ez, the rest j have no clue
Same same
Let me see if j can get some friends in on this to split the cost and then get a better scan
Awesome
Might get my whole class to chip in
Also also, can you take a non manifold scan of a building exterior and port it to bas and at what price
I'll do a full body high quality scan if I'm paying
Like how similar would he look
Ooh I use that armour, did you model it yourself or is it a port also, what would he the limitations of a scanned then ported person
How much? And have you got any examples of previous work
inclusivity in brutality
cool
ooh
ty
maybe ill rescan him
he wears a suit usually so it should be easy enought o find someone elses suit
yeah, could i use the armoured body from somewhere else and just his face
if i share the scan will it help
üò≠
just does BaS support that
not like in a bad way
also hes black, i dont think ive seen black npcs spawn?
ive only got a non-manifold scan of his face which is where i got stuck
is it doable?
that too
posing in BaS with my hands is easier than using a mouse and keeb
its more so i can put him in funny situations
possibly
Heya, would someone lend me a hand, I've got a high quality scan of my friend I'd like to convert into a NPC in blade and sorcery, I have fbx and obj available
try a full windows defender pc scan
incognito mode?
different browser?
id trun off vpn, restart router, clear browser cookies
vpn?
will do üòÉ
it happens, i usually just reboot or wait a while
guess ill charge the headset
right as i ended my vr session
moremodes came out
damn
cool, looking forward to playing with it
is more modes out yet?
i take it back
cool i was worried itd be one try only
that speed map whooped my ass üò≠
awesome, i just finished a first playthrough, gonna compile my scores to compare
Just gave tsukini a first try, I got 89% cause I missed 3 angles, does the qualifiers only count your first attempt or can you practice
man im excited to get into it, im looking into university of michigan, university of wisconsin madison and northwestern - so judging by the user list theres planty of people in my region
ah so they form every seasn and disband - i assume some teams come back every season
is there a list of all schools with teams? are they school related teams?
awesome - i can see exactly where i fall amongst all current players
oh so sorry, i dont usually use google docs, i see it on the bottom row
are those accuracy % do you take the top players score and score teams as a mean divided by top score?
where do i see the raw scores - i can see the 98, 46 etc and stuff
cool, im definitely playing through those maps tomorrow ü§£
are the team ranking and players profiles public. i wanna look at the top teams and teams from the universities im looking at to see how i compare to their current players
ty
what map style do the tournaments tend to? ror do they tend to be a mix of everything?
you can see i dropped off recently with school picking up, but in lockdown i was active
DAMN top 1k global?
ive been a lot less active on ranked songs than id like but ive kept up playing a mix of non ranked stuff- imma find my scoresaber link in a sec
hey, im not in university yet but i will be in ~2 years and im really excited to start in a vr esports team, i wanted to ask what the average scoresaber rank of the players are
whats the average rank for the teams (preferably on scoresaber)
hi, im not yet in college but im looking forward to joining a team someday and wanted to get an idea of the skill level
No clue tbh, you could have a player commit suicide at the start of every round  but that might impact the teams money
although cheating might be a concern with spectators telling their team where enemies are
also adds a little context to each stream, as many maps can be confusing due to their size
hey im not in college yet i just enjoy whatching this server. but in regards to streaming pavlov, after a player dies they enter spectating, if there were a constant 3rd person view of the map with player tags i think it would make spectating and following whos alive and whos not a lot easier
i didnt have the issue with my q1
running a q3 airlink
it doesnt happen in oculus home
ive got a eird rendering issue, my left air has a stair step across it where theres like a offset in the view, like two perspectives in one eye
and default music still plays
i checked with 2 different music packs
all my mods BUT music replacer work
Steam. Then find a oculus airline tutorial
There's a gate in the way
What do I do
Where do I go
The horn went off and the gates are closed
I'm not in SLO mo
Decapitated for sure
Everyone is dead
I get stuck at the castle area (by the sea side with the plank to kick people off of) in dungeon runs
which is the latest
anyone know if you can equip custom avatars in u11
I can't find my spell sword or electricity whip
Anyone know why not all my weapons show up
Remove the mods you added and add them one by one til it infinitely loads. That's the broken one
thats for every version prior iirc
out the back door, and walk down untill you get to the dock
yeah me neither, ive been told its for a futur thingie
by the boat
theres a board down there with the maps
go down a path
you gotta walk over to the door, pull trigge to unlatch and open it
are you on u11 (latest version)
how do i add blade and sorcery manually to LIV, it wont show up normally
heres my mod list, also honour wont work at all
i reinstalled sectory and now enemies dont instantly die. they ust end up like this after i stab/kill them or remove their limbs
go to the map on the wall and select arena or canyon or any of the available markers
is there siomewhere to get premade settings for sectory
ez fix]
oh cool
hi, im on u10 still, ill send my mods list in a sec. but most enemies die at spawn or fall over and die near me. or their neck goes milp and they die or they completely derspawn
this is the best clip of it i could get
So dedicated router vs home network
On my usual network I get 56 or so mbps
Forced 5ghz
Using a BT home hub 4 and a quest 1
Drivers are up to dage
Settings in oculus arent
Ports arent
Router isnt
Cable isn't the bottleneck
I've tried everything I can think of
My link connection is stuck at 20-30mbps
Hmm, ok
Is there anyway to limit max objects/dead people
Nothing despawns and I really enjoy using a bag of random weapons and each time I get a kill I get a new weapon, so after 10 or so kills I get HEAVY lag
<@795716507689943091>
Online it said delete whole file
Uh oh
I removed all mods and still nothing
How do I fix
I'm stuck on a infinite load loop
oof
ive got iris installed, i see it in the files but it wont show up under options/video settings
10 i think
how would i do tjat
they couldnt get through changing the boot order in BIOS to get my installation of windows on USB running
they arent good enough with tech to be trusted to backup their data, reinstall and have it working
so no moral issues about going around a parent or whatnot
its a personal pc, parents. long story short, we're old enough to not need it but the dads not talking to them anymore and its his password thats needed
hiya, i want to help a friend install mods but they need a password to install programs on their computer. long story short we cant install curseforge or anything like that. i tried booting to a different instance of windows via USB but since i was telling them how to do it over the phone ( and theyre tech illiterate) it didnt work out. 

im pretty tech literate so if theres any way to get fabric mods running without curseforge, how do i do it?
is this something i should need to change
okay ill reinstall the server, launch and check
hm
no mods mentioned
looks ike a no to me

container@pterodactyl~ Server marked as running...
otherwise get a different server jar? (i think thats a thing)
so i can try reinstalling the server. starting it and seeing if it makes a mods folder?
but nothing
ive joined the world
working the same as vanilla
so
<@122060227800596485> its currently not working
brb gonna test it now
gotcha
ah so everyone just needs my pack
as it has no other dependencies
and thats the basics needed for that one mod
alr so
server side: falling trees, fabric api
client side: falling trees, fabric api
gotcha
do the players need fabric installed too?
its springracks btw
hang on, ez fix. ive created a /mods folder. imma upload a mod and restart it
on purchase i selected fabric so i think itd be right
should i retarget to fabric.jar?
java -Xms128M -Xmx2048M -jar server.jar
thats the startup command
lemme do it again
yeah
and are mods on modrinth marked out as server side vs client side?
there should be a /mod folder to drop my .jars into right?
ive selected a fabric server if it helps
im a little lost on the modding process
hiya, just bought a server through springrack hosting

it worked 12 hours ago well enough, i fiddled with OTT but didnt like it so reset it and uninstalled
verified on headset and router
both are all good
my Q1 has few seconds of latency via link. Everything has been power cycled, new drivers installed, oculus reinstalled and OTT removed

idk what ive done
what kind of artifacts can i expect with wifi4? sorry just trying to see if some of the issues im dealing with in vr can be linked to the router
100????? i spent ¬£4 on this one. jinkies. hows come wifi 4 is a issue
no but product launched 2013
second hand 2 weeks ago
its sitting in my lap
ikr
on my phone its a balanced 200 both ways
receive 13mbps, transmit 300
My oculus quest airlink connection is stuck at 20-30mbps
I've tried everything I can think of
Cable isn't the bottleneck
Router shouldnt be
Ports arent
Settings in oculus arent
Drivers are up to date
Using a BT home hub 4 (not connected to internet) and a quest 1
Forced 5ghz
On my home network I get 56 or so mbps
Reinstalled game but still crashes immediately after any interaction on quest 1
yooo it works
whats different abt it?
lemme try that
my game soft locks if i make a pvp lobby and when i join a server the first time it hangs for a few seconds then i load. i have to join and leave a game before making a lobby.
agreed movement feels 'slippery' and funky. also could we get a deadzone since my controller has a loose joystick i get jerky movement in game. a little deadzone would fix that, a deadzone thats adjustable would be awsome but a preset one is fine too
Yeah I can recreate it
ive got 2 issues, on quest one my game freezes and i have to restart it whenever i start a pvp lobby and if you crouch and run into the wall at A in santorini you can climb on top of it and get under the map and be able to either infinitely fall or shoot at players through the ground
a deadzone for input, controller drift on quest seems inevitable so why not do as every other console and make it have a deadzone (even if its not configurable its nice to have one)
Sad üò≠
Ah okay, not even if I payed for pc
Dang, was that ever a thing or a rumour?
I remember something about free access
I was on q1 for a while and just got a Q3 so I can finally play again
Is shack free for people who played in beta
ill just purchase for pcvr
imma q1 guy thoooo <:crydeath:701115192519688338>
STEAL OF A DEAL, i was thinking it would be 30USD (dont get any ideas)
üëâ üëà
me fr fr
whatd he do
<:jared:701116304647782410>
Space warp may do nothing
Similar to Nvidias resolution scaling (not dlss) I lose performance no matter what resolution I drop to
Dang it
And maps
And bayonets
I do like the new game mode tho
Back to live then
There's 2 full lobbies and 5 servers
Only 2 rn
So is rc only for testing and playing on other peeps server
So I won't always be able to make one
I'm trying to make a lobby then. So that's what they host
Ahh
Wait wait. If I click create PvP thingy what's that a server or lobbie
Welp. Back to live then. There's only 2 active lobbies rn and I say 3 earlie
It just says finding server
Trying to make a lobbies on rc and it won't load
Wich hasn't changed
Without a server
I can't host a custom map
Lobbiee
Mb
But newer
Those aren't in the live version anyways thought so I'll just have a bit bugier game
Can I make lobbies for friends to join?
Does the beta have multiplayer
anyone got a photo of a completed vcore3
Good luck
it might have been, guess i heard him wrong
i guess, im watching the live stream from above and he mentioned anti vibration idler, i assume he meant the toothed pulleys then
ive heard that the vcore uses anti vibration idlers, what are those exactly? (@me in response)
I did a funny
Wooo
could someone share their klipper config for a v1.1.4 melzi board
not sure if thats the default here but it means people only get push notifications or any notification if there a mention
make <#925478631126474843>  notifications defualty to just @mentions
hey all uk students, hows your schools DT facilities
e.g access to a cnc, drill press, bandsaw
please @me  in any response
made my day
ooooo
Pog
Or if that's just how it is
And I wanna check if my settings are wring
Prusa slicer estimates 6 days
People who printed a full mando helmet in one peice bhow long did it take
i think you might still be able to klipper. and i do sound like a shill but its much better
fairs
toolchanger, dual motors per axis
obviously massive upgrade but a pretty good one nonethless
if youre happy with the setup stick to it, but i would consider buying a skr pro, skr v1.4, skr mini e3, btt octopus, fysetc spider and a pi zero and using klipper+fluidd with 2209's
Hello
Can siomeone send me a inv for this server
<a:POGGIES:832045125508923432>
is there a config to show what name it uses
i may have issues finding that
because my steam username is ''game''
if im connecting via airlink then laucnhing steam vr to play the games which username will it use
thank you
alr
how do i know my username?
how do i check my scoresazber profile
darn, is there a pc 1.19.1 version?
is feetsaber out for 1.17.1?
Is beatleader a good scoresaber alternative
do custom sabers/sounds work with multiplayer
ah cool, one lobby woeks the other doesnt
but just give me rough estimate, e.g more than 10s/ more than 20/ up to a minute
how long should matchmaking take just roughly (for quick play with beattogether)
alrighty
no
we doing it together
we using legacy mods from the archive
we want online tho
you sure
wut?
thank you, so much
can someone link me to mods for 1.13.2
ive got 100+ songs to get onto my, and my friends headset. this should be fun
can i put all the songs into one zip to upload
fuuuuuuuuu
can someone help
on 1.13.2 and corresponding version of bmbf and cant use the sync bookmarks feature
thank you, so much
cant find it?
plz help
i have 300 i want to remove
is there a way to mass delete songs
accidently updated
can i revert to 1.17 for mods
cheers
is there a manual way
how do i download them
the mods (on the headset insided the get mods menu) just show a red X
@me with your favourite maps (need a good starter playlist) i can do up to 11 block per second
Sonjgs are different to the modding part, once you mod it you get songs
It wouldnt be
Assuming they already have beatsaber
If the apk is the same no matter the headset I can link my Google drive with it
how to downgrade
Is 1.14 live
What about the ost 4 update, pls @me when you reply
So if I'm on the latest version, nightly builds will release soon with mods (like beat together)
Ah, tbf the new updates are pretty good so its worth updating but people want mods
Ah, tbf the new updates are pretty good so its worth updating but people want mods
Why ever not
Eta for new bmbf
Lmao
nah i just meant it had been a while since i modded beatsaber and remebered using his sabers
oh hey, its you. i used to use a ton of your sabers
lmao
we updated before realizing theres a mod for multiplayer
cant wait to do custom multiplayer with my friends
get in!
is there a estimate for quest mods being compatible again or nah
will the btt tft 24 work on klipper or nah
all i'd ever want
D U C K
just
nothing less
nothing more
thats all im adding to the game
perfect
pc
is there a list of goood mods or shall i scroll through popular and dowload whatever piques my interest
cool, thats fair
does the channel featured here no longer exist
hey wheres the blade and sorcery mods
right???
but the lids off and thats what matters
i did a delid
otherwise, de chipping it would remove all heat
im gonna try drill a hole in the cpu to help vent the hot air, what do you guys think
salt and vinegar kettle chips
ü•µ
thats too expensive, gotta work with what ive been able to dig up in the ol backyard
would a third core 2 duo e7650 taped be better
for good sped
i taped two together
is my xeon 1250 any good
i used to have one, dropped my drill press on it
my brother said more gigafarts means faster, he said youd be impressed
is my pc good
how come?
tried arcane style
the AI is also good at style transfers like this
thanks, im still learning how to get consistent animations from it
also can i show you something cool, send a selfie
processed the entire video locally in 7 minutes
also lemme send you a video of me a made with the ai
that sounds cool
no i gotta look that up
and on a 3060 (non ti) it can run in ~30m locally
nop, i got those results with 8 photos of me from the backyard
and a mix of full body and up close and portrait photos, if you have any i can try run a training and send you the results
it needs 12+ images in varied locations to work, best with different expressions too and varied clothing
how the turn tables
yup, didnt get much good images though so the generations dont look to good
the 2nd last is a training of me
heres a few of my favourites
can you hear me
i cant hear u
ah well
everyones saying happy birthday, but we only know cause her dad told us, might be a little weird to see a ton of people just know its your birthday
30 subs gained
omg my heart, so sweet
subbed
Thank you
Ahhh
What does the tool do and what was the mod if you don't mind me asking
thanks
does that mean its worke
hi i run the installer and it gets to 100 then closes its self
1.20.4 update not coming soon
aw man
welceme
welcome
welcome
Theres no slot on the side so I tried pressing them in
My m3 nuts dont fit in my v2.2 toolhead where you conect the plate to the quick swap hotend holder thing
Ah, ill see what others are doing or try adapt the switchwire
Is it corexy or would I need go adapt it
Everyone else has a afterburner (dunno how, they have the same setup as me)
I'm already half way through a corexy build. I just need a toolhead
I'm using mgn12h
Ohhh snap
im using one linear rail ina corexy
do i need the v1.8 or v2.4 left carriage
ive got all the stl but if im using this on a different printer
thanks
<@!203924364385583114>  which part screws onto the linear rail
Thank you so much. Your a proper life saver
Ok. So this is the gantry+afterburner and the bowden is addons and couplers
Alright, so the Bowden top
Is all of it necessary because I need it to be light weight
I dont need a top. So I just take the v6 files and the Bowden files and print all that
Yup
I dont understand, I go to Bowden and theres a ton of .stl then theres another folder about the v6 and plates for that, do I need both sets or just one
i really need help knowing which parts of the afterburner i need for a bowden setup (just the toolhead please)
sadge
welp
oh i see
failed to authenticate with scoresaber please restart game  i keep getting this error
It's photo day üòé
Dentist had to do a 3d scan of my teeth (for a new retainer) and I asked for the scan, it took a little cleaning up to make it printable
tried out a marble effect pla, this is the closest pic i could get, its got a nice creamy colour with black specs that add depth to even the thinnest walls. and it hides layers quite well
Wooden. Panel cut for a proper Verizon of my previous post
Made a proof of concept. The proper version will be wood and have a lot better build quality
ah cool
im sure he enjoyed getting crushed by barrels
dang it
and whats that locked cupboard do in the tower
And I love that theres a spatula and muppet book in the tower
Also has anyone put the book in the tower over their eyes. I think its just a trailer bur not sure
Also love how the dandelions actually work. Thats pretty cool
I cant even use magic to levitate him up
So ive thrown everything you can grab or magic down the well (posters and that trophy by the well included) but he just asks for rope
Personally I like the face pressure so I get the ones that clamp on like the linked one
And if she hates pressure on the face get a halo strap
If she plays long sessions be sure to get a battery strap
If she wears glasses then prescription lenses are also a godsend
And I'm sure the even fancier halo straps would be more comfortable
This feels magical
Q3?
it was 9600x vs 3900x
i saw 6900x vs 3900x
ohhh man i cant read
shouldnt it be quicker?
Is that normal
I get a small shock from my the ground on my usbc cable when it's plugged into a combined wall outlet and usb port
xmanager version of spotify and put it in offline mode?
66g
theyll pry it from my cold dead hands
payed 15 usd for it with my keeb too
not dead yet
ive had the same mouse for 10 years
That's like the old thing of speakers crackling right before you got a phone call back in the 2000w
It does it intermittently and usually during low power use
I don't think it's meant to do that
Gotcha
Oh you meant that because the structure is so huge it makes sense it's 28MW and that's what deserves a wtf?
Is 28MW not worth a "wtf"
LG ICR18650 E1
Iirc there's 1 4.3v round cell
P50b laptop battery when?
In a community who will drive LEDs 10 times past the manufacturer spec and use bodge electronics , even the pbs2l is known to be inefficient. It's just how it is
its got a 3.6v input and outputting 15v
kinda - the circuits arent the most efficient so its expected
thats odd - i wont be of much help as im not familiar with USB stuff
try look up "pb2s/l budgetlight forum" for reviews
it can accomodate a protected 21700 cell
the l means longer
you buying one too?
They suffer in cycle life and drain
Vapcell f60 or k60 I'm pretty sure
you can get a max of 12400mah from 2x21700 right now, maybe more in the future
awesome üòé , glad to see it worked out
That's true but fn racing feels excessive because I can get bumped by someone who's actually fat ahead of me
When I play with friends I find that what we see eachother doing is really inaccurate to what's actually happening
Rah
üòé
Also found out I'm 513th in my country
aw man it doesnt even embed
hey <@680802342039584871>  check it out - after seeing you play i decided to get back into it - ignore the silent first clip i messed up the recording
edited in clipchamp so my buttery smooth video got nerfed üò≠ 

10000x0d after üòè
<@680802342039584871> you play BaS?
you ranked?
pattern or speed problems?
you might enjoy tech maps a lot, theyre on the slower side and really tough to fc
i gotta update to the newest version and get back on the grind
but its fun to play acc every now and then
personally i prefer all the speed maps
theres a lot of maps where the whole point is to hit 115 on every block
depends, he might be playing for accuracy and not speed
<@680802342039584871> use a mail forwarder?
I want it for fallout 4 üòãüòã
Decent game
Naw fo76 is actually sick now
Just downgrade or pirate a older version
Yup, ost4 and beyond is decent
Quick progression, only feedback id have is to swing slightly earlier so you don't have to move your arms as much
Especially for 10hr
Damn looks really good
balearic pumping and breezer i remeber being particularly poorly mapped in the exper difficultys
id reccomend trying the OST's past 3, thas where the mapping quality starts picking up
ayyy
But why he looks like that
Forgive my camera screenshot
That's great accuracy for a beginner, are you playing from your elbow tho?
i lived in BS during online school
iirc i reached top 3k before taking a hiatus
get scoresaber (or whichever is the modern favourite) its so much fun to see if youre ass or nopt
I must be wearing it wrong
I've played the q1 stock extensively (500+ hours) and I've never felt like this
30m playing, scalp is numb, eyes are sore
Omg the quest 3 strap is actually crap
I only own a-c cables
I'm in a new car and can't charge my phone
Is c-c the rule or the exception
idk  if this is the right place, but how do you start troubleshooting fallout 4 mods
the 160gb openscad file doesnt look right
ü§®
would you put the bushing inside that sleeve?
oh gotcha, thats cool
how do you know standard sizing, is there a guide of all the standard sizes for everything?
im new to the whole design and source game, but surely if i design something and then source it ad realise its unrealistic thats a good thing?
surely it helps to try source the parts you design around?
when should you start sourcing?
Hah damn
been waiting for the q3/lite to come out
im still stuck on a q1
true
got worried for a sec
ahhhh
did you get the headset too üò≠ ?
Some AR too I swear
it works on win10 even tho requirements say win11
its slowwww
installing chat with rtx rn
That fits for gaming, click response time
It's consistently doing this when taking photos of smaller/ closer objects
Wtf pixel 6a capturing photos before the flash goes off
ping is a command
am i stupid
"'ping' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file."
Steam vr üòÇ
Oops
Hm
Steak vr compositor using 98% gpu
damn  i was proud of my 300+ hours vr time
Like slime rancher esque
Something that's always chill
Whats some good, low brain power games
2025 üò≠
Why??
Damn
Does burn in stack, or does it need to be 3.6k continuous hours
Sounds kinda phony
Wasn't it "left in a hotel room"
This happened with q2 too
Is Sarah the one who does the product design
relay too
not bad for chrome
yeah the one on the right is from a image ive shown before, its a training of my friend
nah you do, ill be first to admit, stable diffusion is far far far behind photoshop for outpainting, in cosistency and quality
promot was superhero cyborg suit
the graphics look funky
i thought it was some xbox 360 game
thats new????
ahhh
the spiderman game or fallout?
the camera moves are so smooth it makes me wonder if they can control every character to be at certain points so they can execute all the right commands
definitely getting that
or is it scripted computer input
do they have someone play the game by hand and just try show off as many features as possible
Ooh i think that webline gadget used to be a mod for the og game
MILES MOMEVENT LOOKS SO FUN
HYPE
is h264 better?
normal 1080p on yt looks like blurry trash
yo ho yo ho pirate life for me
no?
considering inflation
so 300 nowadays is a good price
wait wait, isnt a price of 300 good. thats what we payed for a 960 way back when
i just want more vram for AI
ill wait for 50 series ig
almost worth replacing  a 3060ti
I'd give some more context if I could but the computer just locks up every now and then for no reason
Wether it likes it or not this pc *will* be delivering the frames I want it to
üôè
What tool nukes your video driver entirely and reinstalls them
cool, i might grab one
is the red visible irl? or just indoors + camera
Iirc there's a refreshed 6a but idk how the compares
But yeah if you can afford it get the 6
It does
This were just banging cakes
I'll let y'all know though when it's fake
I'm flattered
None of them are particularly well framed or shot. I'm no photographer and I've got shaking hands
This I can share
All on 6a
Most of my photos are of my family so no sharing but they look great
Just phone out, snap, away
Snapped this today, nothing fancy
Fuckin fantastic
i bought my Q1 on launch day assuming thered be all great games only to realise theres just beatsaber; at the time i thought it was a terrible game but now ive got at least a couple hundred hours between standalone and pcvr
before you buy tho make sure you have a clear idea of what games you're getting
supposedly- im holding out on my quest1- nothing beats that wireless experience for me
but id spend 25m walking around a dark vr room searching for loot
it just doesnt hold my attention anymore
i can never go back to flatscreen
well worth it if yoyve got a pc
ü´∂
ive committed mass murder with the fat man from fall out 4, while wearing mando armour, on the rainbow roads track
i LOVE the randomness and creativity of VR mods in blade and sorcery
But it's about 10% faster
I think optimization
On Pavlov that is
The hardware beats out either a 3090ti or 4090 I can't remember which
L
will i need antenna for this
and preferably it fits in a pcie 1x slot
i dont need incredibly fast wifi
quick question: whats a good wifi and bluetooth pcie card
I JUST INSTALLED YOU
can always get a cheap dedicated router like ive got
do you have a 5ghz wifi netowrk?
theyll prolly drop in price
tho with q3 around the corner
if youve got a gaming PC already thats a pretty good deal
quest 2 second hand and airlink <:chefkiss:643937705910337536>
what was the peak framerate
reaction: unsurprised <:KEKW:987119326710595604>
cheers!
yeah
how can i combine my microphone and desktop audio into one virtual microphone
Pico time I suppose
Ughhh
Otherwise
Idk in my mind it seemed that theyd stop releasing content for it entirely but still support it for wireless
No 6dof on the go is there
That is such a L
And my pc isnt anywhere near a good play space
That's the only way to do wireless link üò≠üò≠
i planned on running it indefinitely as a PCVR headset
does that mean it wont work at all or just wont be getting new features
losing official support by eoy
quest one
bruhh
uh
mhm
oy oy mate how long have you spent looking at the underwear in ark
pour it on
ah ic ic
the 2014 huawei one?
pixel 6a?
whats a slight upgrade too but equivalent to the oneplus nord n100
Can't wait
Guhhh
this would be right up coffees alley
ik but orginal is 85p
what a steal
portal is 85p rn
portal with trx is free
and other stuff with portals. but mainly flashlights
cause if so, you could make a mean flashlight with that tech
would a huge light source 10k lumens with a wide beam angle, sent through a tiny portal. would that make a tiny point of 10k lumen light?
watchng that light through the portal wa sick
idk how itll do in actual games
eh ive tried in vr, its okay but its very noticeable sometimes
thank you
rip vidya game
oop
oh it does it instantly
RIP, no way to clear it without a rebbot?
how can i see wats using my vram
üò©
Ah cool. Thank you
but idk anything about that stuff, just wanted to double check
my dad says there could be spyware on there
if you wanna do it i can show you how
and more variation in the photos is better
i dont have many photos of me
if i had a better train that it
yep
and a suuuper limited dataset
me AI edition, took ~3hours of training on google collab, local offers ~20m for better results
unfortanutely potato got there first
and with people selling dreambooth training for ~8 i could get my money back fairly quickly doing training for others
dreambooth training loooves vram
<@159774913631223809> how soon would you buy
250+120= 370, still coming up short
so
your killing me man, id sell my xbox too
i dont *need * it, but funny AI is so fun
how much would my left foot sell for. i dont need it
üò©
if so^ i might try for it
watercooled
wait wait
i couldnt afford the psu tho
so
250 sale price for 3060ti
oooooh
ack, if no one buys it before i get my job im down
maybe
i may
ooooooo
lemme correct that message: shoulda been *richer*
i shoulda gone for more vram
but
ah, makes sense
i need 12+ otheriwse out of vram error
gah damn why does 3060 get more vram than 3060ti
exactly! too many annex fans here smh my head. they should be banned
oh nvm youre right, tried it and back to normal
thanks <@186469468745105408>
after truning off alwsy on top for task manager it showed chrome was using it, ill switch off that setting just incase but i think it was just chrome
only unusual thing im douing is google collab, does that uise my gpu?
erm
yeah its hard with 2 working parents to get a unwilling child to work and engage
ill attest my brother spent more time at a screen than sleeping but he was a extreme case. i spent a lot of time at the computer too but usually doing something engaging
4M 1 C001 N0W 1 607 7H3 FUNKY 73X7
oooooh im blind
what is 1337
oh same
Ah I suppose. Still salty I got a relatively bad build for more than a 5600x and 3070 goes for. My PSU is showing signs of death (happened twice before) might just tell the builders to take back the pc and keep it and get something better. Oh first world problems üò§
ah üò¢  it is ti
That's nothing new is it
Wait a minute. Mine from last year has 8gb already
loving the name btw
<@566324204417449998> just saw your message thanks for the edit
the new v1.5 inpainting model works wonders for img2img and outpainting, ive been trying out the upscaler but i cant tell much of a difference
yeah doesnt look any worse i suppose, just a little miffed i spent all the time stiking it together for them to be cut off
haha i wish, just spent a while sketching in paint then running through AI
drippy forgü•∂
made a new background for my pc, unfortanutely cant get the aspect ratio right so the legs get cut off
bob explaining the funny
but ill accept 3.50, a ripe box of blueberries and a firm handshake in exchange
i have 23
couldnt care less about new dlss
well now i feel better about my 3060 üòé
because latency
but thatd be üëé
since id want to max out my settings, getting roughly 40 fps and boost to just above my headsets framerate so boost to 72+
so not great for vr
best announcement of the year
maybe when i graduate uni il be able to affor
thats a lotta performanc
gah damn
oh cool
Is that good
I only looked at pc parts during lock down so I've got no frame of reference
That's kinda pricey no?
phew
shoudl i jsut uninstall and ind an alternative?
am i at risk or whats up with that?
but boneworks got a little funny in certain scenes
stick me in a washing machine and ill have a jolly time
im good for anything in vr
sUS???????????
ah fair enough
if you just compare performance/watt
if both got a 50% power limit, would the ryzzen still be better?. if its a 35% perf uplift and not a 35% power increase vs intel that seems reasonable
much sharper
instant boost in ''graphics''
yeah true, ive just got prescription lesnses for my headset
does dlss work in vr, or is just not implemented often
although i wanna see more of the new fsr before i upgrade
maybe ill go amd
oh man
is it actually good. also do you know if its got vr support
huh? how would you encourage him?
so its fine for a casual
oh cool
would you use the new apple watch as a dive cmputer
anyone who goes diving often
<:KEKW:987119326710595604>
Welp, ran every scan option, removed 3 files and now windows defender seems happy
It was mostly just to try out torrents and I think after this I'll steer clear
To get the game?
cool, would just deleting its folder be alright?
sorry to bring it up again, but after ive done a full scan and removed all that windows defender sees, can i try play the game? or rather not
Cool üòé
I've done a full scan just in case
Is Windows defender sufficient for this stuff?
ah sorry, ill remove it then
Peaks at 70 at night
Bruh I'm stuck on 40 down 30 up
It's free so most people have it
thankfully it was just some spare money and not my college funds or anything stupid
thats unfortanutr
welp
i put some money into them a while back and it isnt doing to good, i want out. does this mean theyll likely start going up?
is that good
cool
like iminent doom or a couple months left?
really bad? cause i just keep some pirated games on there
is this bad
i dont know if you could boot without tho, have you tried do a open bench test of the bare essential. one ram stick, cpu, psu, one storage device
any chance you need to update your bios. like the current bios isnt compatible with your cpu? i dont know much about computers tho
just right click and copy the link and you can send it (jus not embeded in a message)
Ah cool. I'll do some more troubleshooting later
if i change the minimum processor state to 20% it drops to 3000 occasionally
i set it to balanced just last week but it keeps reverting
my power plan is high performance
is that the power pofile?
afterburer
0 backround tasks other than afterburner
when idling should my r5 3600 drop below 3.6 ghz
Cool. I see. They shoot out the antenna sideways, not out the top
I'll put it up on the shelf then
Yeah the table is ideal but I need the space for school books
Or at least easier to cable manage
But I don't know where In my room would be better
It's gonna have to go through one wall to get to my playspace for vr no matter what
Could someone help me with router placement
im happy with mine. i know more perf is available. but i run all my vr games nearly maxed out and everything runs like a dream
Same
My dad said it restarted on him but I'm 50/50 on wether that's true. Either way it's resolved now
I don't know if it was the PSU now
Yeah
It didn't crash after 1hr of heaven and cinebench all cores
Oh well. The instability seems gone. After updating windows, drivers, graphics driver, bios, chipset drivers and audio drivers
Is it something that I can ignore safely. I think it's cause I deleted edge files
Alright that makes sense
would this be causing the missing thumbnails
Nah, clciking them works fine. I tried some thing to check and fix corrupt windows files but it didn't work
cool
final issue assuming this psu doesnt die. how do i get my thumbnails back
new psu is installed. i tried my best at cable managment and it doesnt look to shabby imo. especially for a non modular psu
got the new one on the way
Poor PSU
also 7 consecutive critical power errors in 10 minutes. attempting to load discord
or just normal errors
is this bad
yeah, that seems unlikely, we can ask though
if it dies a 3rd time we'll return it, and hopefully by then rtx4000 will be out and a 3070 will be cheaper
as long as this wont die super fast its okay imo
sorry, to add context, its for a 3060ti + r5 3600
oh well
my dad insists on tring to get support to give us a good psu
i think we'll just return it and find a better perbuilt or same specs at lower cost and spend the dif on a good psu
i fond it for 39
itd be stupid to get any lowe power rating so the kolink is the only option
those arent fantastic options
welp
Thank you for contacting,
As an alternative unit, we can provide a CiT FX Pro 600w Bronze PSU, or we can offer a Kolink RGB 700w 80 plus white PSU; providing a higher wattage but at the originally specified efficiency rating as the system was advertised.
Regards
William
AWD Technical Support
alright, guess its up to support. worst case scenario i get a new pc with slightly better specs since the markets gotten a little cheaper
nope
would it because its getting power from only one cable, or just the psu is dyaing and any gpu with any amount of cables could cause the reboot
alright. the gpu only has one plug for 8 pin power. but the closest match online for it has two (and a a switchable vbios)
any chance its because the gpu isnt receiving enough power
in slime rancher 1080p tho
mine just crapped itself twice in 10 minutes
hey <@186469468745105408> how often did your pc restart
same (except its my dads) he keeps it on the shelf. ive played a couple games on there with him
ez just use tinkercad instead
my dad sent a email
bruh
yeah. thanks for the help diagnosing it
im gonna end up with another ass psu
welp, parents insist on phoning up AWWD-IT and have them fix it
i dont mind, all my fan curves are pretty aggressive anyways
which should i get?
its an extra 2 quid
is there any reason to get the 850W over 750w
i cas afford this
its the best i could get from the prebuilt peoples
psu is p650b
case is the mb510L
one sec
uh. not sure, i cant find half the components online
any good non modular one (assuming its cheaper)
RIP wallet
this is the second one ive got. i had similar issues and the prebuilt peoples replaced it. now its back. would the fix be finding some good 750W psu
that is definitely it, it happened twice today
would this be it
where do i look
lemme see
hm, i really dont want win11. i think im on the education version
windows is installed on a brand new ssd, only obviously failing component is one of my hard drives, would that cause it
pc isnt even a year old, had it prebuilt
oh boy
it said no memory issues
and can it run in the backround or should i close everythging
alright, is there a certain program to use?
ram?
and its definitely not a thermal thing, i stayed well under 70 degrees the whole time
so it shouldnt be hitting a power limit (especially in slime rancher)
its a r5 3600 and 3060ti, 650W psu
happened twice within a hour
my pc just turned itself off twice in a row. not a complete shut down but a black screen and then winbdows resets (all apps closed, need to login)
Only reason I like my jack is for traveling, I always worry I'll knock out my earphone and lose them
Really sorry
Shit
And I don't think I'm even half way through yet
It's so damn good
Finally got around to half life alyx
ill find a spot for some more rgb then
cool, didnt know if it needed to be a special type or hgave a special controller
can i plug any old rgb strip into the rgb ports on my motherboard as long as the pins match up
where could i improve?
rate my cable managment
This mark is on everything
How do we get it to look the same way as before
Could someone help, onedrive had marked all my mum's files as in the personal vault, she hasn't set it up yet. Is there a way to disable the vault without loosing any files
Oh cool
Insanely good or insanely bad
It's underpowered for sure but at 99 quid can't beat it
With a few optimizations I get 2 days without charging and roughly 14hrs SOT (assuming no Bluetooth devices and only browsing)
I'm happy on my OnePlus Nord n100
Oh and display cable
5 total
In that photo is 2 power wires, a webcam wire a Ethernet wire and a mouse wire
Cable management complete
idk i guess i can see it without turning its just uncomfortable
i sit ~2ft away and still turn my head to look at the far corners
God damn I struggle to see my whole 27" monitor how tf do people use dual 75"
I think I've got 2 exposed wires one of which you can't see really
It's not very practical if you wanna switch out wires but unplugging stuff isn't too difficult
Oh man if froggies cable management is good I can't wait to get home. I got some flexin to do
is it something i should install or keep an eye on or is this for developers (sorry for all the questions this stuff is just way out of my knowledge set)
is that good?
i think it means amd better
is that good or bad for amd
yup
from mrwhosetheboss
it doesnt, worse battery life than s21
if we're still talking about beatsaber, then quest 2 has nearly every pc mod and can do 120hz
have you seen modders have noodleextensions running on quest now
true
same particle settings as i run on the quest 1
bruh. my 3060ti peaks at 60% util in beatsaber
I'll try both
Hub
At least it's functional with a hib rn
Yeah, I will probably contact GN, while they're on a roll
How do I tell
How do I fix this, this is a prebuilt btw
It's all slanted
Am I stupid or is the Io not lined up
<@540888808640741376>  ^
Hm, maybe I should should order a new PSU and cancel it last second
So then my point is wrong
Oh I see
Does the number include those who are active or just have steam
It makes more sense in my head
But people buying a MacBook to game will be more likely to have a m1
Out of the people with gaming capable MacBooks x% have M1
Tbf those numbers are probably a bit biased
what temp rating was it, ive got a 16V 470UF 105 degrees celcius capcitor
fair enough
alr how come same capacity, whats it affect but yeah higher voltage and better temp]
so i could get a same or higher uf capacitor and a same or higher voltage capacitor and it woud be fine
well, i havent been told of any other issues but its pretty busted so this is the only way i know of to try fix it
ths is a very old gpu, cap can be as tall as it wants, the hjeatsink my finger is on is all there is for cooling
Dented on the right and the leg is sticking out
one sec
sure
its dented and someone pulled the leg out mostly
ive no clue how to find a replacement
would someone mind helping me spec a new one
ive got a broken cap on a gpu
a website
^
from a video a saw (cant remeber who made it) its a backwards capacitor thats drawing excess current. the wrong palrity should have been picked up by visual inspection but wasnt
But take your time
But yeah keep going
They break the window to enter
No I meant the office workers
Break window to enter
its really a gorgeous game, its a shame its so scary
it is, i play 1080p with my 3060ti and it struggles but dlss looks fine if i render at 720p
~~comedy~~
or at least reduce latency for galaxy buds 2
anyone know if its possible to change codecd in w10
im sure nothing bad will come of that
*assuming you pay our monthly subscription for fucking yourself
go fuck yourself
no
wanna own a house
i got to scared and gave up, now i just mess around with all the accessibility settings and play with rt and dlss
yeah uncompressed, makes sense
quest two stays comfy using wireless and wireless pcvr
bruh, what resolution warrants cooling for its wifi thingie
then wait for the admins to clean up
if you wanna get rid of the notifications, just right click the server icon and click mark as read
oooh, welp nvm
whereas a black pair would probably last longer before needing cleaning
airpods, dont look great with evena  bit of dirt
My brother has a pair, they really dont lend themselves to dirt, they're so grim
but a bath is hydrogen peroxide (assuming thats right) then a isopropanol bath will stop any shorts right
ah cool, fair enough
assuming that works
ive got some hydrogen peroxide apparently thats a good cleaner. so im happy to get refurbed and wash with that
or
hi all, having a hard time deciding which is better (same product just refurb vs not)
ill give you 5 bucks and a firm handashake
The AKG he recommended are me daily driver already but I'm looking for a step up
Needs punchy bass I think and good for male vocals, crinacle jumps price too quickly for me
whats a good iem for ~30 bucks 40 maximum that has a lot of punch, something for gaming
What's amazing for 40 bucks
ill trust u guys, ill be back with 2 sets of heaphone and bt and let you vote
ah cool, you mind if i ask a few more questions tommorow
the kz az09 is a bt adapter i linked earlier, dongles over your ears
would the kz azo9 not work here?
eek, nothing with a round the head wire or something near my arms thats via bluetooth
yeah cool, that seems to be the best then
ah alright, would they sund as good as those iems or nah
my blazer doesnt have big pockets
ah wait is there any TWS  option
ah ok, so i can connect a iem to a jack tho and into the bt
and by jack you mean 0.78mm pins
so i want .78
mmcx is the round one right?
cheers, didnt know if that bt would change per headphone
<@!174411368936636416>
and whichever bt adapter
with spinfit 100
my secpond choice is
no need for a mic
hows this pairing for bluetooth head[hones for my walk home
fell off my chair yesterday cause a stupid ad started with a loud bang noise
im very jumpy and while the game is fun and so detailed i really hate horror
or does it have any jumpscares
is control a horror game?
plus these on xbox also total price of one GBP
building my steam library, total cost is 14 GBP
cheers
anyone have some 'must haves' that are on xbox game pass
could you recommend one, id like to check mines working right
Huh so the new Nvidia scaler brings no performance uplift in any benchmark. I thought maybe I'm CPU limited doing 720p on the 3060ti but even on a 1660ti with no OC I lost 300 points on superposition benchmark
i like my stock lenovo quite a bit. its not the lightest but its lasted 8 years with minimal wear. its definetly best suited as a office mouse tho
When all others are within 40 points
Got a dip in performance by 100 points In a benchmark, weird
Maybe worse
Even down to 720p and scaled up it's no change really
True but I'm not seeing much improvement in performance with scaling
I don't see a difference in image quality but I'm using 1080p
I'm trying it out rn to see if there's much change
Have you guys seen the new Nvidia upscaling thingy
although, why upgrade when you could have 10+ bots doing one task faster than 1 upgraded bot
lumber is definitely the constraint
im "stress testing" my capabilities
these guys will be condemned to the endge of the map when i finish
oh i know
<@!131888315866677248>  on the road to 500 bots
subnautica didnt release this year tho, i think
or lone echo 2
it takes two is the best ive seen imo
ah just a announcment then
And will it replace dlss
Does previous experience suggest it'll look better or be better than amd
So it's a easier to implement dlss that works for everyone?
and mods
once im boared imma build a super factory in creative cause why not
also 380 god damn thats a lot]
quit for good?
getting to 20 total
im just stuck at the first 3 coloniser thingies so im addding a few more bots
well worth the money
I LOVE IT
ALRIGHT FIGURED IT OUT BUT NOW IM STUCK AT THE FEEDING THINGY
Hey <@!131888315866677248>  what are wheels and gears for?
D E F O R E S T A T I O N
stupid good game reccomendations
i blame zifnab
OH FOR FUCKS SAKE IVE BEEN PLAYING FOR AN HOUR
i like the cutesy artstyle, the rest i can ignore
thanks for the recommendation, i think im gonna buy it
what settins do you guys use in nvidia control panel or the amd equivalent
Welp thanks for the help all
I'm gonna assume changing the power limit by 6 percent fixed it
Alright 1440p and shit tons of explosions with cranked settings and nothing
Even with the settings cranked
Set off 5 thousand individual bombs for a few minutes and got nothing
<@190265238816292865> I've ruled out the explosions causing a huge spike
Nah, uk
Alright well I'll leave just cause running and if it resets today or tomorrow I'll send it back under warranty
Resets happened at random intervals afaik and didn't happen when I exploded stuff
So fairly stable for the game
But I still have my usual overclcoks on and the frame rate never dipped under 120 and never went hiher than 141
I have added a sad to the PC so they may not take it back
Lemme open just cause again at a lower resolution and see how it goes
So more like a reset
I didn't hear the click noise that it usually makes on full shutdown
Any other benchmark I should run
And the case temps and GPU temps are currently higher than when I was gaming so not an overtemp thing
Heaven is running rn and it hasn't rebooted
Max power percent on the GPU during heaven is 101 with the limit at 98
No spare psu, is there any way to check otherwise
600w integrator brand
Except my GPU only has 1 6pin afaik and no vbios switch
It says it's the gigabyte gaming 3060ti oc pro (the triple fan one) revision 1
Nope, large tower thingy
GPU boosts to 2.01ghz and sits at 63c
Everyone in my office has headphones in all the time so fan curve is far more aggressive than stock
GPU and CPU temps are under 70 at all times
Instant restart and no need to turn back on
And should I try run a benchmark on it or just keep playing the game since I know the game makes it reboot
Is there any harm is changing some settings and waiting and watching for a reboot while playing
I'm not sure why but my PC keeps restarting while I'm playing just cause 4
cool, thank you for the help, since this pc is in its final form ill just get a vetroo since its a lot cheaper
Doesn't need to be the best one just the thermal paste that won't be 'bottlenecking' the cooling
And what's the most reasonable thermal paste to get, regardless of what brand I buy
The noctua is a bit pricy and on my CPU the vetroo is less than 1 degree hotter, is there any reason other than quality assurance to get the noctua over it
Also is the biggest issue on AliExpress aio just leakage or the chance of leakage
Ah alright, would the vetroo v5 be alright
ill wait til black friday and get a brand name 240mm
is it worth changing from a stock cpu cooler (wichever goes with the ryzen 5 3600) and buying this aio 
yeah theres a few at justcause4mods.com but the launchers dont work
has anyone had any luck modding just cause 4 with the newest update, tried 5 mod loaders and got nothing
i hope they make a full store of well priced pc building accessories
Oh sick
What is it?
low res, terrible CPU and BD value at full MSRP and a not very scratch resistant glass isn't fantastic
BUT
I charge every 3 days
Nice enough camera for text, big screen, nice refresh rate, still updating fw and a humongous battery
If performance isn't what your after I thoroughly recommend a Nord n100, used
Im still using free earbuds from a airplane
next youll be saying 500+ for rollers is silly
sounds reasonable to me
got 417 points less than my friend with identical cpu+cooler and same capacity ram but slightly slower
bruh my cpu is very unlucky
i got unstable clocks and a m,assive noise and power increase
at least yu got power rduction
Oh meant to reply to <@192355339721506816> , mb
No thanks
Don't sweat it, opened Minecraft 1080p with some shaders (continuum) and my apparently stable clocks made the entire PC restart
whats a more intense benchmark than cb20 to run
it works perfectly now
nvm
Hn
Instant restart after running cb20
<@122460697874399235>
fairs
looking at this the highest performance is gen 1, is that coincidental
ah cool
ill rerun diagnostic to be sure, tune is just for extra performance then?
like this
do i just type in the results from DOIAGNOSTIC
otherwise the previous docs and the vid helped
i just dunno what to do with results and profiles
i can rerun on 2.0 tho
2.1
yeah its for zen 3 wich is different
mines a gen one quest so maybe improvemnts in q2 but passthrough occasionally warps and twists
but what do i do now thati have them
heres all my results after running diagnostic and tune
just finished going through it but need help interpreting results
plus lidar and full colour pass through that isnt warped
yeah that makes much more sense
i thought each one was a core
ohh my bad
could someone help
wheres all the other cores
hm
Works easily in one hand
It's small it's got a great screen and camera and it's not too wide
Pimax is great and all but varjio is where it's gonna be imo
Zen phone 8?
i just want cooler temps and similar performance, im assuming if i dont know what a avx woekload is i should be fine]
is it properly stable, a lot of people dont seem to think so
does ryzen clocktuner work or am i better off enabling pbo and auto oc, on a 3600
not if its better than another cpu
just to check its performing as it should be and i built the pc correctly
im moslty using it to compare my cpu to others with the same cpu, same for every component
haha, thats a funny one, you should tell it more often
to 230
went from 78fps
tldr im fucking stupid and had a fps limit set on my gpu in nvidia control panel
only later on?
and none of the impacted settings are relevant to me
and it just disables a few features and enables others
ill just go for education since its cheaper
fair enough
i dont think ill need that, all im doing is adding a ssd to install windows to
alright i found someone called u/s5ean that people seem to like, should i buy education or home edition
and where would i get that key
awsome, i can get my pc running and figure out the intricacy's later
whats that change?
will that disable it on the current machine
wonderful
is that full windows
that sounds easy enough
also im a student if that helps but the website doesnt seems to like my email
is this good
also, where can i buy windows from
ive no clue what any of it menas
my friend keeps insisting ill do it wrong and install legacy vs eufi mode
hello, can someone point me towards how to install windows 10
it happens all the time and i hate it, if i dont know an answer ill just say i cant remeber and then we all move on and stop wasting time
bruh i hate when people try fudge their way into sounding smart or just make shit up, its not too hard to say 'i dunno' or 'im not a professional'
Beatsabrr is the least nauseating and Pavlov the most nauseating
And walking dead saints and sinners comes 3rd
But Pavlov is a close second for me
Beatsaber all day no doubt
i drop my phone 1 or twice a day
nah i hat curved glass i always end up shattering it
that band is getting scratched af if i get it
So cringe
Ewww you actually do that
This PC is mainly for my little brother
Oh well
Didn't know that was even a thing. I suppose it's a bit late now tho
I have AA very small budget
In the UK, curry's sells 3090s for 10k
which is why i went prebuilt despite my friends saying i was stupid for not just 'get a gpu'
exact problem i have
i assume to share it with a group or he works on multiple machines
hm
or x
or z
theres no discernable y axis
Yeah that's pretty good
Final question (I promise) does anyone have experience with AWD-IT
I suppose it works then
Well it fooled me
Cause Ill probably never go higher than 1080p
Is that for 8k stuffs and whatnot
Or is it gobbledygook
Does that matter
Final-ish question the TI has 8gb vs the non TI having 12b
Alright and the prism cooler will suffice until I can get the $$ for a better cooler
Would a 5200rpm HDD be good enough for my non gaming stuff
Although I could take from a spare aio
But my current has to go to my little brother
Yes
I'm already 140 over budget
I know it sounds like I'm trying to be contraindicative
Well closer to 1080p but I would need that ti huh
Cause the ti only comes with 240gb Wich is half what I need minimum
Let's say I run discord, 1440p and VR would the 3060 work well enough
I know at the end of the day both will make me happy but still
And I keep feeling like it'll cost more for the ti build cause I'll need to add more storage and cooling down the line. And do I really need that much processing power. This just has to last 2 or so years
I'd like to keep price low too
Otherwise occasionally cad but mostly gaming
I'll be mostly VRING with it
its just too confusing
most parts are equal other than cooling, psu, and cpu wich is a amdvsintel issue
but then comes the storage issue, the non AWD has much better storage for only 20 bucks more
the worse coolers may perform worse evenif the parts are better
see the predicament
but then the awd has terrible coolers
I'd have to check so I'll follow up in a hour or so
See but then the awd hs the ti version and the other just has the 3060 so both are within spec
But the AWD iirc had 650W EVGA and the cyberpower had a 500w generic psu
I think that's listed under the  case header in the file
the infinity one is from cyberpower and the MB311 is from AWD-IT
yup, it hurts me inside looking at these prices. my little brothers pc decided to die though so hes getting mine and im getting a nice gaming pc
would somone look over them and point me towards the best one
but i have no expierience with gaming pcs
hi, just finished making two spec sheets for the ps' im considering buying
yeah iu figured, thats what parents are limiting me to so its time to scour ebay and the interwebs
oh cool, ill look into that
alright so assuming this pc will be upgraded in the future the list you sent is best i can get but if i just need something to game on that wont be upgraded a prebuilt with 2060-3060 is better
also, this will be better than a prebuilt right, i really just gotta get soemthing that works well
so tldr seems its pretty on par with a xbox and can handle most low end games
the mobo is unlikely to need updated though, right cause i dont have ay other cpu to update the bios with
thank you for the translation, ill take a look at the site
and nearly any case reccomended by gn for airflow will be fine + whatever fans
that doesnt happen often right^
Warning!The Gigabyte B550M DS3H Micro ATX AM4 Motherboard supports the AMD Ryzen 7 5700G 3.8 GHz 8-Core Processor with BIOS version F13. If the motherboard is using an older BIOS version, upgrading the BIOS will be necessary to support the CPU.
also sorry to spam you <@!174411368936636416>  but
and would 500gb m.2 ssd and a 1tb hdd be cheaper and higher speed (ssd only)
possibly i can do diy, will this run most games at medium settings 1080p
theres no pcie slot that isnt 1x either
its all of it, its a 3rd gen i7 running on the igpu with 1600mhz ddr3 ram
Yeah thought so. Ah well more waiting it is
My current ones a Dell üò¢
is there a reccomended ¬£800 prebuilt. im not allowed to build diy cause reasons and i can go up to ~900 if i wont have to spend money on upgrading the pc
i suppose we play often but never a variety, so we're kinda useless to facebook
ah fair enough, ive got a friend whos done that, but my other 4 with headsets play 1-2hr daily
2.87 million units (according to google)
is that considered small in terms of algorithm doodahs
which games?
i suppose its the same as mobile games, attract a 'whale' who just spews data and sell it for profit
oh no, their game reccomendations are wacko, "oh you played 'the walking dead', try 'cookout vr' its very good "
i dont like the paperweight thing but its fairly rare and this is all ive got
no ads in vr as of yet, my facebook account is barebones and they really only get to see what games i play since i dont sing in to anything else on the headset
what do they get out of me that makes up the cost of the headset
if valve can make a good headset i might buy it but only if theres crossplay with the quest since all my friends bought one
fair enough, but right now theyre the only people with a good standalone headset with a large userbase and library
also does anyone play A Township Tale
im hoping to pick up the next revision of the quest, apparently it will be announced at facebook connect
sad life when your pc cant even run a game about beavers eating wood
got some nice thick ones and i wear them everyone, home from school= pajama time
nah long panted pajamas are the best
/s
Sometimes
And it works
Nah thats ridiculous, i got my 50000W psu for20 bucks shipped from aliexpress
if facebook doesnt bother you the quest 3 is where its at (once it releases) with slime vr trackers out theres very little reason to go index
that one ltt reviewed recently is not a great case, from what ive read there far better cases and ltt ends up reviweing a lot of bad apples, but a not so smooth build gets more clicks than a easy user friendly one
Better than the amazon mmo rpg thats for sure
Ive seen a few sources claiming its a weird sized one with expensive upgrades and others saying its soldered on
Asumming AAA
Isnt the 400 model only 64gb of storage and most modern games are 100+
F
It'll feel like death
Thats gonna be sickening
No
Tbf if its super cheap it might be worth getting as a stopgap
Infact rock actually = metal
100% true
For a light panel im making, i have easy access since its not yet mounted
Just stuck to a sheet of plasticy paper
Just led tape strip lights
Would someone like to help a rookie figure out why his leds dont turn on
iT nEeDs MaRlIn
Power spike would feck ikt then
Can anyone conect to gtao. I just keep timing out
May aswell  slap on a new cap
Well may aswell try if you dont mind losing 12 bucks, also that cap is looking a little “ì·¥ú…¥·¥ã è
Tbf its dirt cheap but i wish it was better
Lol my ping is usually sub 3 but upload speeds are ~45-30
I think sodium is best
Java gets updates sooner and has better graphics options plus mods, if youre struggling with fps get Sodium, it boosted my fps from 1 to 24
The scroll wheel is worn smooth and the wheel occasionally stops scrolling but its good enough
If you're talking mouse life mines atleast 6 years old maybe 8
Lol im still using my defauly lenovo mouse, input lag isnt too bad and it fits my hand quite well, also the click is great and tracking smooth
I just popped the case open with a knife and glued my axle back together ad replaced the button
If its anything like my mouse its a 30m repair
I think both, we can get machinery and lua bots and we can get better biomes and envireonments

Lemme try

Try using an eye dropper and compare the hex values
Best I can do is 60
Now how many mm/s to time travel
Ah. Ill need 21 jigawats to power it then
<@151044308097564674>
Not sure if its incandescent or flourescent
So. Turns out I'm an idiot. Its the monitors backlight and its a tube with black thingies at rhe ends
And would pulling out the board and checking the bottom help much. Ik printer boards are marked bur dunno about monitors ( <@151044308097564674> )
I can send a few photos and the monitor model if needed
Im a big noob so I haven't plugged anything in yet
If I plug in some leds the wrong way around, will the break and how do I figure out wich cable goes in which plug (tryind to reuse some internals from a monitor)
thanks
ty
i think you're the person to @
this acc should be banned
<@954467647364419604>
or photo ai
i was told you lot would know where i can get a cracked version of topaz gigapixel
is there a drumming game for vr
one where the drums actually could line up to a real drum kit
like beatsaber but on drums
other than eyeball it how can i see the bitrate in effect
but i cant tell
id assume the tool overrides everything
do you know how the in headset settings for the bitrate interact with the debug tool
oke oke its the bitrate, 150 is too high. 30 is okay
imma go setting by setting turning stuff up til it breaks
i didnt do anything, just put the settings to default
the delay üò≠
WHAT THE FUCK ITS BACK
cause OTT was fucking everything up
for future reference <@463505220966809620> rocks, and never trust when a program says its unistalled - double check its install location
yeah sure
if it rules out anything
ill run any test
idk because its worked before- less than a week ago. which is why this confuses me so much
stable diffusion, A1111 but thats fully closed
lemme get  unigene engine
normal perf on AI apps all week
3060ti
lemme run a benchmark rq
üòÖ
local  server
there was a warning on the oculus that my gpu wasnt supported, could it be a compatibility issue there
so why do i get such a bad link expirience
so the actual connection is fine
so is my phone
headset speeds are 300+ or up and down
how do i go about that?
much smoother
THANK YOU FOR SHOWING ME ALVR
alright so its just a blurry stream -  i think thats cause the headsets only receiving 58Mbps despite my pc sending 200
or just open the app on headset + quest and it does the rest
do i need to be at the computer every time to start the link
but its veery low res
within reson*
alvr has no latency
maybe
BIG IMPROVEMENT
that cant be good
the wifi panel on the quest shows a links peed of 
receive: 58Mbps
send: 865Mbps
Eek, none of my friends have a good WiFi setup, I can see if on the weekend they'll let me try tho. Also is alvr free?
but i REALLY dont want to d that
i dont know what to do, whats the next step in trouble shooting other than resetting my pc
factory reset didnt work <:sadge:804466724497653778>
the router is connected via a ethernet cable to the pc
wired link wont work, since i play in my bedroom but the pc is opposite side of the house in a shared office
now its just awful
ive always had perf issues compared to other people with a 3060ti but chalked it up to luck of the draw and subpar setup
worked great yesterday
today
my Q1 has few seconds of latency via link. Everything has been power cycled, new drivers installed, oculus reinstalled and OTT removed
idk what ive done
it takes a while to get good, ive got ~12k images generated total. so getting results i want is fairly easy now
using the readme on github is the easiest way to install imo but nerdy rodent will show you the ins/outs of generation
nerdy rodent and aitrepreneur on youtube are great
yeah automatic1111 stable diffusion
this isnt in any specific style

holy crap! i've been looking for the solution to this problem for MONTHS and here I found it in my monthly search for the solution. How in the world did you figure this out??!?

I installed media feature pack for my version of Windows Pro N and the home screen was working again! thank you for sharing!
In the end the problem vania because in the last update of windows the windows media player was eliminated, since it is my version of windows, windows N, does not have it by default already installed.
When it is installed back it works again, it was all not being able to play the video file from the home page

1st is from chatgpt, 2nd is what ive written
PVC, a material widely utilized across diverse industries, boasts remarkable abrasion and chemical resistance, as well as inherent rigidity in its pure form. Its adaptability goes beyond physical attributes with the incorporation of plasticizers, which alter PVC's glass transition temperature [TG] and other characteristics. These additives impart increased flexibility and resilience, countering brittleness. By disrupting intermolecular forces within polymer chains, plasticizers facilitate bending and shifting, while also sealing minuscule gaps between these chains, preventing water penetration. Consequently, PVC finds extensive use in piping and outdoor equipment. Moreover, certain plasticizers mitigate the deleterious effects of UV radiation, bolstering PVC's durability in outdoor settings. Some plasticizers introduce voids within the PVC matrix, enhancing its flexibility, particularly evident in wire insulation.


PVC, a widely used material across various industries, has impressive abrasion and chemical resistance, along with rigidity in its pure form. Its versatility extends beyond physical properties through the use of plasticizers, which modify PVC's glass transition temperature [TG] (amongst other properties). plasticizers can make it more flexible and less prone to brittleness. Plasticizers achieve this by disrupting intermolecular forces among polymer chains, allowing it to bend and shift. Additionally, plasticizers can seal tiny holes between polymer chains, preventing water ingress, making PVC ideal for piping and outdoor equipment. Furthermore, some plasticizers can reduce the harmful effects of UV light on PVC, enhancing its longevity in outdoor applications. Certain plasticizers also introduce gaps within the PVC structure, enabling extra flexibility, which is seen in wire insulation.
PVC is a very commonly used material in many industries. Its abrasion resistant, chemical resistant and very rigid (in its pure state). Some examples of PVC usage are electrical tapes, pipes, wires, and packaging. PVC is a very flexible material in terms of its uses (not physical properties), through the use of plasticisers, PVC‚Äôs TG (glass transition temp) can be modified to make a more flexible material that is less brittle. Plasticisers do this by disrupting the inter molecular forces between the polymer chains thus allowing the chains the bend and shift over each other. Another way plasticisers can change PVC‚Äôs properties is by sealing up microscopic pores between the polymer chains, preventing water from seeping in, this makes PVC perfect for pipes and outdoor equipment. Its use in outdoor applications makes even more sense as some plasticisers can reduce the affect of UV light on the polymers strength.

6.    Graphite has a far higher melting point than iodine as it‚Äôs a giant covalent structure with strong covalent bonds, these require lots of energy to overcome and melt the graphite. Iodine forms a simple molecular structure where two iodine‚Äôs are bonded covalently with weak intermolecular forces holding the molecules in a lattice, these weak intermolecular forces are easy to overcome so it has a low melting point compared to graphite. Graphite has layers of carbons with 3 bonds each which leaves one free delocalised electron to carry a charge so its very electroconductive, iodine on the other hand has no free ions or electrons to carry a charge so it isn‚Äôt electroconductive

The writer of Source A has no plan to shoot the elephant,
as the rifle he takes with him is too small for the job. The
writer sets out how confused he feels from the start as he
says ‚ÄòI did not know what I could do.‚Äô Throughout the text
his view shifts from being determined ‚ÄòI knew with perfect
certainty that I ought not to shoot him‚Äô to the final line
where the reader realises he has to shoot the elephant.
On the other hand, Bartlett makes it clear that he plans to
shoot Jumbo as soon as he sees there is a risk to the
public. Bartlett states ‚ÄòI made an application to the
council to be supplied with a powerful enough rifle‚Ä¶‚Äô The
formal language reflects his important position at the zoo
and his calm approach, as he feels it is his responsibility
to deal with the elephant‚Äôs violent behaviour

I 4 both extracts the elephants are described. as dangerous and powerful and This is seen in

Source A in brohen its and in source B. : tusks through von plates", From this that clephants are powerful, but once free are you can infer docill. This is shown in Source A as the clephant peacefully eats grass and on Source B. Jumbo being perfectly quiet in the gardens. you can infer that elephants are naturally docile and only aggresive when retaliating against man..

In this passage from "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," Stevenson uses language and structure to create tension through the use of vivid and descriptive language to paint a picture of a harsh and unsettling night, as well as through the use of rhetorical questions and the repetition of phrases such as "nothing wrong." The use of words like "wild," "cold," "diaphanous," and "lawny" to describe the weather and the "flying wrack" creates a sense of unease and foreboding, setting the scene for the events to come. The repetition of the phrase "nothing wrong" also serves to heighten the sense of anticipation and unease, as the reader is left wondering what exactly Poole is worried about. Additionally, the use of short, choppy sentences and the contrast between Poole's physical actions (removing his hat and mopping his brow) and his emotional state (his face is white and his voice is "harsh and broken") create a sense of tension and heighten the sense of something being deeply wrong. Overall, Stevenson's use of language and structure effectively creates a sense of tension and foreboding in this passage.

At the end of the play the inspector delivers a monologue exploring themes of responsibility and community. In his final speech the inspector states that ‚Äúwe are not alone‚Äù and that we are ‚Äúmembers of one body,‚Äù emphasizing Priestley‚Äôs didactic message of socialism. The repeated use of the collective pronoun ‚Äúwe‚Äù is used to place responsibility on both the entire birling family and the contemporary audience. Priestley‚Äôs use of ‚Äúone body‚Äù calls upon religion to emphasize the moral value of socialism. Priestley (who established the socialist party in Britain) directly appeals to the audience through the inspector‚Äôs final speech to change their attitudes. Once the inspector leaves, Mr birling‚Äôs stage direction ‚Äú(triumphantly)‚Äù summarises the upper classes attitude, where there is no change without punishment. Priestley ridicules Mr birling and his capitalist values with dramatic irony, Mr Birling describes the titanic as ‚Äúunsinkable, entirely unsinkable‚Äù the audience is aware of the titanic sinking and therefore begin to doubt Mr Birling‚Äôs opinions as he appears to have unreliable views. Priestly does this to emphasize how warped Mr birling‚Äôs view of reality is, the inspector has fooled him and the rest of the family though he behaves triumphant afterwards, reflecting his view that the titanic is unsinkable though it sank on its maiden journey.

Fortunately, there are well-established physical principles that will tell us exactly what the difference will be. There are two sources of distortion that result from digital sampling.

The first source of distortion is aliasing. This effectively means that you can only measure pitches of up to half of your sampling rate. Increasing the sample rate from 44.1 kHz to 96 kHz will increase the highest pitch that can be recorded from 22 kHz to 48 kHz.

Since our ears only have the sensors to pick up sound in the range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz, the additional pitches above 22 kHz will not be audible. I don't think a single person has ever been documented to hear frequencies above 22 kHz. We can be pretty sure that this part will have no effect.

The second source of distortion that results from digital sampling is quantization error, which happens when you must round the value of a sample to the nearest whole number of bits. E.g. the value 0.733569 might get recorded as 0.73357. The effect of this error is to create a noise floor at some volume below the signal.

For 16-bit sampling, the noise due to quantization error is 96 dB. That means the noise will be 96 dB quieter than a maximum-volume signal. Not everything is a maximum-volume signal, though, so let's add another 10 dB to account for those really quiet parts of orchestral recordings.

If you play your speakers as loudly as a rock concert, that's about 105 dB. The noise floor will be 105 dB - (96 dB - 10 dB) = 19 dB. That's about as loud as rustling leaves.

Do you think you would notice rustling leaves while standing next to the speakers at a rock concert? If not, going from 16-bit to 24-bit sampling will not make any audible improvement for you.

I certainly don't think I could tell the difference.
no difference
mayaswell try it then
can you eadily reinstall icue
looks like it can cause crackles
try uninstall it
do you need it
do you use icue
unless ur usinmg studio quaklity 600+ headphones
theres no difference, u just monkey
what headphones u use
nothing audible
quality]
ah well theres no difference in 16 bit 44100 vs 24 bit 44100
its the standard one
try the bit depth and sample rate i have
add a bit of bass
eq just makes it sound better
welp. lower bit depth it is
fix crackle
yes
get better sound
also mess aroud with the eq
try this in the realtek audio console
gaming time
and if i can get jamie to pick up thn probably him

Hey, @everyone! Hope you're having a great week! We‚Äôre here with another update for you all, this time dealing with **Client-Side Impact**.

So, what are Client-Side Impactors? Generally, they are what make you **able to hit things reliably** in-game! Some notable improvements to this aspect include **forging effects, general crafting tweaks, and being able to attack enemies with better feedback**. Don‚Äôt worry, though, hitting someone in PVP will still remain as challenging as ever-- we aren‚Äôt changing those rules!

In addition, some **handling of tools and glyphs** has gotten an update. Namely, the side belt remembers tool position, making it easier to be ready for anything in a moment‚Äôs notice!

Hope you enjoy the update, and check out the full patch notes here: 
reddit.com/r/TownshipTale/comments/qref92/a_township_tale_official_patch_notes_quest_v0021/

Thanks again, and enjoy your weekend! :SchmeecheeRed:

Dear Families,

We are delighted to let you know that we are starting our Hadracha (Leadership) course for students in Years 10 & 11.
This will take place on Wednesday evenings from 18:45-19:45 in Beit Tefilla A (upstairs) and will be taught by Noam and NNLS educators.
It will start on Wednesday 3rd November and run through until February half term.
This course is a fantastic introduction to leadership skills covering topics such as:
    ‚Ä¢    Programme planning
    ‚Ä¢    Teaching techniques
    ‚Ä¢    Behaviour Management
    ‚Ä¢    Team work & communication skills
    ‚Ä¢    Games workshops
It opens up lots of opportunities for students to work with us here at shul and at Noam in Shabbatonim, camps, residentials, Torah Breakfasts, Kehilatainu etc.
This course can also count towards the skills section of their Duke of Edinburgh awards.
We very much hope you encourage your Year 10 & 11 students to apply. We have a limit of 20 places.
Please sign up here and we look forward to seeing you on Wednesday 3rd November.
Niki and the Education team

update in pavlov pc
'next we are going to.......steal the moon
why.......
vectors introductory phrase 'comiting crimes with direction and magnitude' builds a quirky and enjoyable character which appeals to both adults and children
despicable me is an enjoyable movie featuring comedic characters and a enjoyable plotline
many of his actions would end in mass death or total world annihilation
and makes the watcher dislike the main character
this creates a disconnect throughout the movie
gru consistently commits murder without a care or thought to the impacts of his actions
why its bad: the main villain is very predictabloe and never makes choices that make logical sense
like 'commiting crimes with direction and magnitude'
has funny ctachphrases
why its good: includes the character vector
despicable me  is a great movie
vr yet
poop ton of pissics

Look at my pro repair job. The driver (imaged) came without a pin so I made a new one
Then it moves til it hits something
You adjust the sensitivity so it knows what's actually a wall
When the motors runs into resistance it draws more power and the stepper driver notes that down and says we hit something
And then moves to a coordinate based off of the 'home'
It sets the wall as '0' or 'home'
Just rams itself into a wall and figures out thats the end
It uses sensorless homing
Also I got my printer to work
Ill phone yo when I get home
At boots optician
No space in my room rn, after lunch?
kk
minecraft
Having lunch play later
sure, ill phonr you in a sec

How do I know if my keyboard is already mechanical
Noice
cya
cool
vc?
i seeeeee but arent the switches the same wether custom or not
i couldve sworn cherry switches werent the best since they were scratchy
wait isnt gateron better than cherry
so im not worried
aliexpress is pretty good on refunds/returns tho
ali baba?
cool
i really like the gateron brown switches, anything with those
ok, then whatevers good, us or uk
then us. if its cheaper i can live with it
also the keyboard doesnt need to be full, just the same layout as the letter keys
then linear or tactile. i justr prefer the clicky noise
aren't linear worse
Whatever this layout is
for switch probably tactile and layout im not sure
any that you recommend? if you could buy any sub 100 preferably sub 50 keyboard which would it be cause ive got free choice and figured i may aswell upgrade
oof anything sub 100?
do you know any budget mechanical keyboards

ww2 was caused by the league of nations inability to prevent hitler from breaking the treaty of Versailles. the league of nations appeased hitter to keep there peace but this led hitter to believe that his actions wouldn't bring repercussions. he invaded country's and formed allies, he also grew his army and the league of nations sat idle. tensions grew and ultimately, world war 2 broke out.

Alum is a better conductor and has more wires
And is a worse conductor
Steel has one wire
Higher
Either way you say there's lower resistance in the aluminium
So idk if the q is about a single strand alum or the grouped
More wires together decrease total resistance is what it means
As it resists the flow
Lower current
Higher resistance in the steel

The beating drum of the storm drew closer, a parade of marching rain and clashing thunder. Clouds let loose a barrage of water. Their droplets beating out like a drum. Winds weave and twist past. they slide between buildings; their mischievous howls piercing the land. Explosive batteries of lighting blast above- buildings tremble beneath their might.
I didn't even use a thesurrus
Better story üíÄ
U were right
Bruhhhh
Rip
The vessel left the port hours ago. They finally reached the great barrier reef. The colossal ship gently floated being heled up by over 10 km of waters. Below them laid another world of creature some never before seen by anyone.  The cruise ship was glowing as the suns rays gently laid themselves on the ship. The distinct pink and yellow corals caught the eye of many of the passengers aboard the vast ship. Many children were tapping their parents and pointing towards some jumping dolphins. The shipped lowered a substantial anchor into the depths of the cosmic like ocean.
Click. Max opened his plastic bottle so he could drink some water, he promptly finished the bottle chucking it behind his back. Splash. The water landed in the blue abyss sending ripples through out the vast sea. Max thought nothing of it.
The plastic bottle laid peacefully on top of the sae. Jellyfish, sea urchins and squids all passed the bottle looking at with curiosity. The ship was long gone with them leaving 2 days ago. The bottled continued to relax being blanketed by the warmth of the sun, until a small young dolphin noticed it. It inspected the unusual object and innocently tried to eat it.
The dolphin started to choke. The dolphin couldn‚Äôt stop, with its little remaining energy it tried to push it out. It tried with all its might, but it slowly ran out of energy. The body started to sink. The limp dolphin reached the bottom of the sea where it lay dead with hundreds of other dead fish and dolphins. The plastic bottle slowly began to escape the corpses body. Pilling up back at the top of the ocean waiting for its next victim.
Threshing waters wash over me. My free will seized by the waves, slamming me through an unforgiving sea. Id been cast overboard by a violent tipping and tilting of the boat. Put out to sea by a callous power far greater than I. the thrum of my ferry fades, its garish colours slip away. 
No alarm will ring for a plastic bottle overboard, though it should. this is a life sentence much longer than most, a millennium forgotten at sea.
I resign myself to the waters, my descent to a seabed is gentle. It‚Äôs not uncommon, I pass many a brother and sister. I settle into the sand; my only visitors are inquisitive creatures.  From here I can see all that transpires above.
I once saw the delicately fading sun beams twist beneath the water, scuttling over shells and coral. Illuminating their vivid primaries. Boats scuttle across an otherwise still ocean, their propellers sending dances of sand and silt through the water. Their contrasting dances spinning overhead, delighting even the calmest critters. Swarms of jellyfish intermingle with plastic bags their translucent bodies casting soft shadows across me. The occasional whale will pass, their gargantuan bodies sending powerful waves past. Kelp forests flatten under the waves, they flail, and twist forever entangled with each other.
 But now its different, cloudy, murky waters obscure much else. Their permanent ashen colour casting a faltering light across me. The only thing illuminated now is the lifeless skeleton of a once joyous coral kingdom. White and soulless their creeping fingers reach towards the surface. The kelp forest long smothered by fishing nets. Their strangled leaves limply lean in the currents. A once lively landscape now forgotten and dead.

At the end of the play the inspector delivers a monologue exploring themes of responsibility and community. In his final speech the inspector states that ‚Äúwe are not alone‚Äù and that we are ‚Äúmembers of one body,‚Äù emphasizing Priestley‚Äôs didactic message of socialism. The repeated use of the collective pronoun ‚Äúwe‚Äù is used to place responsibility on both the entire birling family and the contemporary audience. Priestley‚Äôs use of ‚Äúone body‚Äù calls upon religion to emphasize the moral value of socialism. Priestley (who established the socialist party in Britain) directly appeals to the audience through the inspector‚Äôs final speech to change their attitudes. Once the inspector leaves, Mr birling‚Äôs stage direction ‚Äú(triumphantly)‚Äù summarises the upper classes attitude, where there is no change without punishment. Priestley ridicules Mr birling and his capitalist values with dramatic irony, Mr Birling describes the titanic as ‚Äúunsinkable, entirely unsinkable‚Äù the audience is aware of the titanic sinking and therefore begin to doubt Mr Birling‚Äôs opinions as he appears to have unreliable views. Priestly does this to emphasize how warped Mr birling‚Äôs view of reality is, the inspector has fooled him and the rest of the family though he behaves triumphant afterwards, reflecting his view that the titanic is unsinkable though it sank on its maiden journey.
cool
in singh songh the writer utilises comedy to emphasize how joyous his relationship is with his wife despite its issues, this contrasts the aggressive love seen through natural imagery in sonnet 29. the speaker in singh songh "after vee hav made luv\ like vee rowing through Putney" this original metaphor creates a vigorous and humours tone reflecting their unusual relationship. the use of a dialect in writing emphasises their relationship as it‚Äôs a blend between british and indian culture, this is seen in the quote "brightey moon" where the use of a romantic symbol of the moon and dialect combine to show the speakers love for his wife and her blended culture. the speaker‚Äôs aggressive tone in sonnet 29 is seen in the quote "wild vines", the use of wild brings connotations of uncontrollable love and the use of natural language "vines‚Äù further accentuates her feelings of strong love towards her husband. This aggressive tone is continued in the phrase ‚Äúand let these bands of greenery‚Ä¶drop‚Ä¶burst, shattered everywhere‚Äù this shows the speaker is not content with only their thoughts of their lover and would rather have physical contact. Their strong love is seen in the word ‚Äúburst‚Äù reflecting how the speaker feels as if she‚Äôll burst if she cannot contact her lover. This aggressive desire contrasts the physical joyous intimacy between the speaker and his wife in singh songh

Oh god, the superfly vid was just wrong in so many ways and the delta printer vid was just another guys vid with dpt getting the ad revenue
Ooh that asshat
Is that a direct quote?
his ass is jeaulous of all the shit coming out his mouth
im not the smartest but his fully enclosed printer build was bad right. from my very not pro view using a long rod that gets heatcycled as a stepper extender through 2 possibly non concentric couplers is stupid
i dont mind him making money and building shit stuff, but when hes racist, steal content, claims others steal content when the entire community latches onto to trends and talks about it or copies other vids himself then its crappy
ah so if he gets a factory to do it then you can go after him but if hes directly mass producing in his own home/property then you can do diddly squat
oh i cant wait for the day that guy starts selling and patenting it and gets invited here by some 'unkowing' fan and gets verbally bombed

Hello
are these the two files i need to share my save game with a friend
cheers
could i have the .stl?
yeah, but even in spill, i found they looked fairly similar with the sp36 having a larger and slightly brighter hotspot
weird, im total opposite, just tried out a sp36 and was underwhelmed, found my sc31 was near equal just slighlty dimmer
thrower or flooder
2nd light, im buying 2 off amazon to see what i like more
and is there a l21b equivalent thats available on amazon
which of these emitters is most functional with good throw
could always slap a tir or diffiser
will they accept the flashlight after slight use
is it worth buying a flashlight for more on amazon and then return it and try my second option then buy my favourite off aliexpress
im still a newbie but maybe the d4v2, its fairly floody. but im not too sure. sorry
sorry, out of those two, leps are out of my budget
and which do you use more often
ah cool, so ill use culpm instead, which one would you say is most impressive for showing off
looks like a jack of all trades
i do love my sc31 pro, its got anduril, good range, plenty bright, built in charging, great to carry if you remove the clip and got a fairly wide beam
seems the cslnm is really great for hunting whereas the culpm is more usable with a throw of over 1km. you have both and which one would you say is more impressive or surprising to show off and which do you use more often
the only dislike about the l21b is the lack of anduril otherwise both of these are perfect although i might use the culpm emitter or something wider as long as it can reach
which flashlight would be cooler or more impressive, a l21b with cslnm, school building 1km away which the flashlight can reach and theres direct line of sight; sp36 blf anduril with all the houses around me it would light up the road pretty well
I'll open a dispute and try diy it
Saw a nice vid on it from a fairly reputable YouTuber but I guess I got a broken one
Ah shucks
does anyone know how to open this up and swap batteries
white lithium
l21b to be specific
can i use whhite lithium grease on the threads of a light
also, just got it moving, thank you
and should i be doing this at range or at a nearby wall
is this visual or do i just wiggle it til the hotspot is perfectly cicular
i assume simon uses threadlocker, so i should heat it up
ah cool and give the whole thing a bump
the lens or the head
<@!707486206417698856> /@ <@!691033446167871578>
dont wanna break anything
is there a video guide for that
btw ive got a 3d printer if i can print this
how do i center it and should i contact simon about this or can i solve this at home
its barely visible, looks like its from a glass coating
is there meant to be a dim purple edging around the spill and should the hotspot look like a flower and not perfectly circular
does anyone have a osram/culpm l21b that can answer some of my questions
so culpm for throw and lumens as long as the extra heat doesnt bother me
@me in reply
before i make a bad choice which emitter is better in the l21b (or is there a completely different emmiter i should get)
Nihttime, very humid and foggy
L21b culpm emitter, roughly 1.4km max distance and closest is 400m away

skr pro vs fysetc spider (@me in responses please)
I've got the actual stick and not the sauteed ones
Ah. I guess ill check reviews and avoid their drivers
how come, ive only heard good things from fystec
yeah, im gonna try get that new fystec board for its extra slots for fans and thermistors
Called the mercury one
Custom corexy
Ah. New board then
Same with the thing by thr 150
The thing above the VOT writing looks broken
I think I had my wiring backwards, like the rst pin to 5v
It doesn't look to hot
akright, so they dont look to bad and look undamaged
can i desolder and resolder in a new one
ah nice, so i assume it is integral
<@!308819827592658944>  nada, no power leds and my second board doesnt turn on either (dunno if its never had lights and i never noticed but may aswell mention it)
wish me luck
about to go do it
also just to note, it took a second to pop, like when the lcd went on it popped
all right, how do i verify its on, i guess the green led
nothing bad or nothing at all
nope, sensorless homing
shall i remove my tft and try running it
yes the tft cable does use 5v
its the first item underneath the SWD pins
heres a diagram with components
should i turn it on again?
no, too scared to turn it on
found a redditor sayings its this 'It looks like a 47uf 6.3V Tantalum capacitor in the SMD 1206 footprint'
and i dont need it too much
nope, just lcd
so i dont think i really need it if i go back to exp1 and exp2 for my lcd, right?
It sits under the swd pins and above the t250
lemme get a better photo
yes its a 1.4, but the fuses didnt blow, i think
nah no fuses, only damage is from this one charred peice
not sure what to call it though
the circled parts is charred really bad although its only one part
oh yes, plugged in the power and heard snap, crackle pop
I swapped from exp1 and 2 to use the tft cable slot that comes with the tft24
Only wiring change was my lcd cable, the lcd looks fine tho
but thank you for the help
i got a good explanation from a friend, cartesian is direct driven and the arrangment of that direct driven axis happenes to be croxy
also @me in reply please
and if it is different what does croxy look like
since croxy is cartesian but is arranged differently
is there a difference bwteen crossxy/croxy and cartesian
Yikes
Hello!
i cant ifnd them in the book
do custom avatars work on u11?
thasnk you
ive got a eensy weensy bed no need to abl imo
for probes theres no ''none'' option
sweet
so if i have a linux pc i could host a online custom server with friends and custom maps
Can users host custom servers and maps
looks fine to me, just use duct tape ü§°
saves weight on everything
it looks like the ultralight version of the merc
or this
vs
<@!173827530929733632>
i say ender 6, custom frame or a tronxy
I plan on upgrading to a similar build
Maze's build is pretty much all advanced stuff
I should get a second 48v psu soon but rn one 24v one works fine
Im running a board + pi + secondary board
Ah if you like it then go for it and try the og hotend you got
Probably a thongiverse mod for it tho,
And you mayaswell try what you have now and change later
Well, theres a eva toolhead now, i would use those with the microswiss since its easier to replace parts on
No problem, the difference in bed movement still hurts my head
The bed is independent of the toolhead
Bed moves towards the bed to homke
If this is for merc there's a proper bom now in welcone
Totally, i bought a tesla cause my tire went flat and i needed new ones, totally economic
buy 32 bit board and desolder integrated driver and smt32 chip----> profit
Put my farm back together really wrong
I figured it out
Ah it's alright
Asap
Can someone send a photo of the front of the printer at the bottom of how the extrusions are put together
I just soaked it in acetone and slathered white lithium grease on it after soaking the bearings in oil
Make sure you have cleaned and relubed them. And if its missing any balls (there should be space for 1 extra bearing) buy some new ones
How did you mount a afterburner if it uses mgn 9
Cheers
<@!347144798102093825>  could you send me your klipper cfg
also, is this close to what you were thinking? 
its probably gonna be very expensive
oh nice, is it any good. i got the skr v1.4 turbo ( i plan an putting it into a marlin printer later hence the turbo) and im kinda regretting it with only 1 controllable fan
rn or in the future
impressive, 6 controllable fans and 9 stepper slot
dayum
see where my mess of wires is coming out from, yeah thats it its open air and holds my ras pi with a kinda press fit, in this config you lose z height but if you move the lcd its all good for z height. i can send it to you if you want, it mounts on the 2040 extrusion with 2 m4 bolts or on the bottom 2020 with 1 m4 bolt, its not very strong tho
nice
im looking at making a afterburner eventually and i seems to be more expensive to buy the hardware kit than to buy a knockoff bmg, is there any reason to not gut my knockoff mbg when it arrives
Cable managment done (albeit crudely) all that's left is one shipment of tnuts and firmware. Then its just little extra bits and bobs to do
ya know back in my day computers wold catch on fire all the time and just keep working, whats a little flame ever done huh. pc's these days are such snowflakes always catching on fire and not working again/s
not actual trinamics, but the onboard chip is usualy trinamics but the implementatuion is up to them
yep its 'trinamic'
yeah the only reason to use knock offs is money and unfortunately i am HEAVILY money limited so i gotta use knock-offs
true, genuines have better qualty and firmware
same i expect those are mediocre drivers. also rotating the model 45 degrees on cartesion will also give higher resolution results
wheres corexy has 2 working in tandem with double accuracy
true, but i still stand my ground on the fact this was probably tested on a cartesian where the stepper directly controls the precision
But isnt there a massive drop in torque, also interpolation mixed with a corexy system would make this a non problem,no?
wich motors are you upgrading to, imo most stock steppers are sufficient on a light enough toolhead
lol
damn you built this in roughly a week, ive spent a month+ ordering/sourcing parts
nice
i meant how far do the rails go along the extrusions
and how far along the rail
how to i arrange the rails, do i just set them as close as possible or just eyeball it or is there a technique/rule
lil dudes being put out of their misery
yuppp
go on
its probably the only one left in existence
<@173827530929733632> you might be happy to hear but the printer which wont be named (my little fire hazard) is finally being decommissioned, im building another xorexy with its parts tho
its still got the foam panels from the dumpster
in all its fire hazard glory
i might be there to rep vzbot though
ill bring *that* printer
i can show probably
next year?
Run water through the frame and make it a heatsink
That's what I hope. RGB in the vslot, water cooling with brass piping and laser engraved steppers. Rtx3090 and r9 running klipper
I'm just hoping he builds a full spec vzbot with cf and metal and does a custom water loop and all the bling
Pushing jay to build a mercury
LoL, who's LoganLuckLess om youtube
80% sure you gotta take the switch off that acrylic plate
Just glass from a fridge I found
Nah not a touchpad, although a LCD and tons of lights around the edge would be sick for a dynamic display case
Personal project, and imma use it for the awkright engineering scholarships (they give me money for projects)
Might make a super complex mount for a rapsi and use a long extender for the mini hdmi. Really make it look fancy and boom it's just a eensy weensy raspi
It's a bigun
AA battery for scale
Yup
I'll probably fill it with decorative junk
The case is so overly big because I don't have a glass cutter but I do have lots of room so I just extended the case
The actual machine is next to it out of frame
Mb, a electronics case
Also helps visualize how much wood I'll need
Proof of concept. Can't go to the hardware store til tomorrow and I had a couple hours to kill so I made a carboad proof of concept
I might grab it
But if I see a carpet tile
Probably not once everything is mounted
Well
And a glass panel
Gonna have RGB and a hinged lid
Proof of concept
The hotend is compatible but I'd still reccomend mounting on wood with a l shaped bracket
Otherwise it's mostly ender 5 bits
I just built mine from ender parts. I've slightly modded it to use less plastic and more ender parts. And to run klipper
flaws are: it uses a blade instead of sharpened bearings (community bottle cutter from recreator3d works great), the hotend is mounted directly to plastic it seems (recreator has it mounted to the x carriage with a cooling fan but a simple l shape bracket would be better as the heatsink only gets in the way, and its a little ott in terms of plastic use (a wooden board looks less cool but will probably work better since heat becomes much less of a concern)
i can see a couple flaws in that design
im building a similar unit
Dutch dude afaik
cheers
for a m3 heat set insert what size hole should i set?
Man I gotta talk more
tried out the new theme, turns out the docs are idiot proof üòÑ
Magical innit
And now it's been three

Gotta find my phone
In a sec
But it's round ish
It's a little undersized and I'm not sure what temp it melts ar
I made filament
Also
No need to take drastic measures
Hey woah hold up üò® we can talk this out
not sure if its reccomended
its what i did
the build so far uses nearly exclusively parts from an ender 5 of any model. and total purchases rn is 7 GBP excluding one purchase of a carbide cutter for a dremel
oops caps
ILL BE REUSING THE ENDER 5 PRO/MAX/NORMAL ELECTRNICS BOX TO HOUSE THE ELECTRNICS AND TO MOUNT THE MACHINE TO
i just need the electrnoics box from <@!186681249652277248>  and then im done
ive got the wood, ive got everything printed
and electrnocis
apart from setting up klipper
im pretty much done
its such good timing
hehe most of my messages are asking for help
me trying to get my SSR to work right
the leaderboard for messages puts me at 2nd-5th and i havent been too active the past few months
tbh, i was just here since 2020 ish and messaged a lot
ive been missing out this whole time smh my head
where do i sign up

they will determine what speed, accel and scv you use
country?
Potentially, check out the 3d print generals latest video for some Inspiration
on the other the engineers are lovely people and not terrible people
slammed my knee into my bed twice yesterday
oof indeed
i can throw pretty well but cant for the life of me catch. i can play beatsaber great but reaction time is higher than average and in normal life i have awful hand eye coordination
hell nah
bruh
ive been doing a ton in vr where you walk around them and solve them but no change so far
but im awful at visualising anything so going from a 2d sketch to 3d is **pain**
yup
and a couple hours
this is just tinkercad
they arent awful
i did design the circled parts (the cylinder is just a reference)
forgot how big the nozzle was so now i gotta use gap fill
nah just kidding
i did good cad'ing. it looks not terrible now
that guys crab watching the printer was cute
ah same, theres some interesting stuff there
which sub ?
the brown adds speed
time to build a polycarb heated cat enclosure
i was about to cancel my order, good thing i waited <:pepeCool:844138461547593798>
so you're saying i cant use it for laser eye surgery?????????
That print just looks grim. All covered in boogers and artifacting, not a single clean wall in sight
but should work for other abs parts
awsome
wheres this, so i can save it
i might get a 2-3 is veeery thin no?
fair enough, i might sell mine for another ender
only people ive visited is slice engineering, lovely employees there
lucky you
thats in dw7 from th3d, the firmware is a little unstable but its what i run
baby stepping?
i have a spar mobo. i might use that and a spare touch sreen to change
100%
yup, without tons of mods its a PITA
the daughter board sucks ass, half of it isnt used and is just empty ports
also so you have a link for that firmware, i casnt find it
mines 100% the y axis tension. not enough adjustment and came way too tight from factory
whats your biggest gripe for the printer
sheesh thats a lot of changes
thankfully most of the mods ive done can be accomadated for physically
cool, ill search it up. i use a dd right now and its worse quality but i need it for the all metal heatbreak ive got
oh? im still using theirs. what do you use now
same, its gone through periods of perfect printing where i click start and leave and periods where ive felt like dropping it out the window
ah mine was september of 2019
hey same, when did you buy yours
and prusa still made that mistake, 5 years later
good luck for the drive
if you're uk ill send you mine, they didnt help me but i have no use for them now so you mayaswell have them
two 1080tis still beats a 3060ti
the threadripper is really good tho, set this up as a server thingie and have multiple pcs run off it. grab a 3090 and have 1 case for 2-4 computers
daaaamn thats a expensive mobo
what did you trade?
yes, it was made for deltas to just screw into
that sentence is a little unclear
belt length is ÔΩåÔΩèÔΩéÔΩá
but obviously no one should be condoning it
but im just putting vegetable glycerol and water in there
and it makes my throat itchy
dw ive got windows open and a fan running i hate the shit
does it wqork for you?
same
whjat is it
sure
sexy
thats at least 3 meters
i'd say (as a profesional)
i can estimate
google drive?
please elaborate, im not sure i see your point
alright, but calling someone special is not ok
alright, calm down, we were all noobs
usually comment if i can
iirc im also subbed, i try and subscribe to everyones yt
havent needed numbers behind it for quite some while
the username i have for games and other stuffs is still unique
not  a single other living person has my usernasme
psh my name is the most unique of them all
12 generations time and yourr gonna have some fine dining shit
An acid brush is a small disposable multi-purpose brush. Their name came from the plumbing industry, where they were used to apply acid flux for pipe soldering applications. Acid brushes are used to apply glue, or other liquids and [certain] chemicals, and for quick small-area cleaning or wiping applications.
haha imagine being able to visualize any distance. in all seriousness though who wants to say their printer is 9 and 449/1000 inches
The spider is a solid choice for sure
Delta?
What fans
Was it teaching tech's website
Maybe try tuning
Also that quality is so good, the walls look a little lumpy tho
When'd it break
Damn
<@173827530929733632>  when someone asks when something gets released just respond with <:soon:917460946476220437>
Doubt
Nice
Ah
Or did you just add
Ohh is that from this server already
With the press x to dou t
the bigger the amount you extrude the more accurate the esteps
nope, extrude 200mm and do the numbers
theyre using bltough
np
just tape it m8
<@!201902512117252097>
yup
they did say that data blocker but for power (if such exists)
^
one that carries power will give you issues
a data only cable will fix the issue
tape or open the cable and remove black and red wires
like rudra said
ahh
moving the printer?
otherwise, you might need to cover or remove your cables ability to send powah through the cable
nop, do you have a data only cable to connect the other printewr with?
imagine being in a non uk time zone, cring
5 30pm here
hello!
Sort by cheapest and refresh daily is what I did
What country, I'll take a look later
or if you are ok with building a full new z and tapping holes, build a diy or buy a x5sa
lots
ebay
gbp
i got mine for 110 used
weird sound
And some IPA
Or for high speed some machine oil
But do you have any white lithium grease on you
That's possibly the issue, I'll listen to the vid in 30m when I get home
On mobile
Lube sorry
<@288037276070576129>  what did u use to live the rails
And.is.it In stealthchop or spreadcycle.
Is it a buzz or a hum noise?
benchy intensifies
Highly depends
It might. It depends on what's in the gcode
bake in oven
pla?
use acetone
abs?
By like x2
Isn't that hotned more expensive than the magnum+
What do you want them for
gemini board from mellow maybe
They just File it through AliExpress cause it's easier
I think the seven is when they ship it to ppre realese testers
chec k out his frame brace, it might be compatible with merc
vez3d did this and i beleive it helped quite well
the stock board is okay to use unless you want some of the fancier features like uart control (set driver settings via firmware) and sensorless homing. otherwise the stock board is okay. for other builds check out <#818597194856792065>  and the github for the printed parts. you can also find someone with simnilar specs as you and reference their klipper confi but its strongly reccomended that you get comfortable with making it yourself
<@704014399853166734>  how can I help
ill join in a sec and listen in
i got revision im procrastinating on
whats going on in vc
perhaps but its wuite late
<:PepoRage:844138461685350421>
Build surface?
Flow is meh but you can add a volcano later for it
ehh who needs that
welcome aboard
Price range? Shipping time
Hah jokes on you
Last week rember when you promised to send me all your printer equipment
Oh Wonderful
And we could call it power grrrr
It's stepstick sized
But get this
What if we made a power deliver board for 48v
<@451709396280410132>  I have one last fantastic idea
also, hoe do you pronounce tronxy, tron-ex-why or tronk-see
and maybe a ramps board
and threaded rod for the frame
what if we used kapton tape on the bed
definitely
we could call it quick-sketch magnetic clacky probe
maybve they can be the contacts for a probe
aha, we can use magnets
IS THIS WHY MY BOARD ALWAYS DIE
WHAT THE HECK IS PREHEATING THEN
IVE BEEN MICROWAVING THE PRINTER THIS WHOLE DAMN TIMEE FOR NO REASON
you dont
wait
maybe we can make it self heating and add uranium to it
perfect
yup, there it is
with the power of 5g we can heat the block
wonderful contribution
or erhaps lgs stands for large garish strudels
large gear 'struder
and mayhaps a 3:1 ratio
lets make an acronym for it
with large gears
this extruder
now
yes
its all english officer
something with big gears
we can make a extruder ourselves
well
frick
i think we should ask mellow about making a boudeon extruder
thank god we were here to create and nourish such a wonderfully delightful idea
lets spread to the other servers and spread the good word, for we have solved high speed printing. with no quality degredation and little backlash introduced by a ptfe tube ( i just decided we need one of those)
bow-din
i got it
ah
bow-ew-din
pronoonced
hey i said bouoden
huzzah!
idk
we could call it bouden or smthing
moved the extruder off the toolhead
but what if we
i have a crazy idea
lots of belts doubled up over one rail
ah
so howwould the belts go
its like a corexy but veretical right
no, switchwire but cantilever
i dont think that would work
like a switchwire right
how would cantilever corexz even work
Cheers
Can I share this
yay
my bitcoin is up 73% as of now
F
Nah 60 is alright I think. 75+ is a bit iffy imo but depending on whether it's a high temp version or not it could be fine up to 100 or so
hahahah, someone on annex forgot that torque wrenches were single directional
i am loving the annex redesigned logo
darn it, and tsa would not take kindly to a kilo+ of lions goingthrough an airport
daamn, thats a local thing right, i wouldnt be able to do that in the middle of london perhaps
thats what she said
<@!88387946813591552>  how big is the z axis on the large format printer
Max range 1.3km
New toy arrived a few days ago
www.cableworks.gr/ilektronika/arduino-and-microcontrollers/motors/stepper/nema-23-stepper-motor-57sth56-2804a-1.8degrees-12.6kg-cm-2.8a-for-3d-printer-cnc/ retail
minimum 1:2 i'd say
fair enough, i do think gearing it would be veeery advisable
<@!88387946813591552> ^
and for z 
for y you would want rails similar to these 
similar to tycho iirc
and for the z a worm gear and nema23
for the bed i would get multiple ones so you can save power, assuming you do large and small prints you can have a full heated bed or a small section heated depending on the print
Huh. Weird
I'm thinking of doing the water cooling for the awkright engineering project
Will this be on a enclosed printer
Fair enough
And it's infinitely expandable assuming the rad can keep up
So 36 pounds base
About 30 pounds for reservoir pump and rad and tubing is quite cheap with fittings being printable or a few pounds and all that's left is hetapippes Wich are 5 or so pounds
Less than peltier I would think
Or a plastic 4 legged holder that gets screwed in and applies pressure to the pipe which gets thermal pasted
No mod required version would be a copper block that gets screwed to the motor and had a embedded heat pipe
It keeps the water out the enclosure and away from electronics
Consider a heat pipe soldered to the motor that sticks into a reservoir of water that gets pumped around a radiator
Retractions are mostly to relieve pressure so I think it's gonna be mostly okay
Just get a large enough CNC and sleep on that
Not with that attitude you don't, who needs a bed anyways amiritr
makes sense i guess
marsgizmo and mihaidesign are brothers
i think i read soemthing abpout it being all the coatings on one nozzle but idk
i wonder what coating goes on here
true that
sure, but OBSIDIAN. i hope they just wanted a fancy name
hm
the only thing i really dislike is vector 3d being sponsored by e3d to cover 'all' of tct3sixty when in reality we all know its so that their new announcement gets good/positive coverage
i guess itll be the same as v6 where 10 is max reccomended but you can squeeze 16 out of it
ah yeah 10 isnt great
that would be mighty impressive lol
here
might wanna re read your first message
pardon
yeah, and to stop it from overheating. so now theres hardware and software limits
it does talk about being super light, and that round heater and what i think is a long meltzone is quite nice
i cant find the image again but they said something about a ptc heater ( i think) that reduces energy output the higher the temp. so being able to swap cold and having a hardware thermal runaway control will make this quite enticing for primary schools/public printers

*Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) heaters are self-regulating heaters that run open-loop without any external diagnostic controls
heh, just talked to maze about this in the vzbot server. consesnsus was, probably wont be faster than what we have now but will be better for beginners and young children
2/3mm iirc
<@!173827530929733632>  you want messed up bed, have a messed up bed
thats what elegoo do, they do very small upgrades to enders and sell them at a fairly good price
you could sell them or just toss them to the back of a closet
ive kept all my spare hotends just incase of catastrophe but i doubt ill really need them
How much does it cost
gn
f
lol fair enough, a bit of sand paper will clean it well
jeez what a maniac
well stacked
and those layers
it makes me sick
ewwww, those walls so flat and the holes so concentric
the middles worn smooth
yup, got a nice solid line on the side of mine
Good luck ü§û
and if youre really stuck youre welcome to ask in the relevant channel
hahahahahah, i know that feeling all too well
lol just clicked that vid to share here
i know, if early 2016 tech could do it first then its not much to brag about
it says industry shortest filament path but ive seen those early ungeared dual gear extruders with cut down heatbreaks+hotblocks screwed on with tiny paths
im sure microswiss know what they are doing but whatever poor intern got high and designed this must cringe everytime he sees this
what even is 'low overhang design'
ew
nice
not pirated?
Mine was not and the bed was terrible
Make sure its a reputable seller
cubic or gyroid for me
looks like its 2 halfs with each half having the tower built in
unmoddedgets me ~0fps since it crashes
tried that, these numbers are with sodium
i can run it at 5-8fps at 720p <@!173827530929733632>
darn
java edition?
i can only play bedrock edition but most everyone else prefers java
ah cool, just wanted to check, cant wait to see the build
<@!361204711954710528>  just saw you join and get the builder role, have you started the build?
cool, i might join later just to listen in
a slight possibility
ah cool, its just a maybe
or just vcing
live build?
i dont but i know a brass nut can work with a volcano nozzle
whats on the door
meanie
pog champ
wake up sheeple, the 3d printers manipulate my youtube feed and convinced me those linear rails was necessary
sadge life for me <:sadpepe:867922624569815120>
'giveaway for eu '
aw man i really liked those guys
considering going to tct3sixty, has anyone been before and feel like sharing their experience
look at this fun and safe project ive found
yoohoo <@!451709396280410132>
Wish i could intern there
My bad. I thought there was
Although there may be some flaws in the mods so ymmv
Of you are hell-bent on afterburner there's option like Vinny said but Eva already has all this officially supported
It's got exactly what you need
Check out the beta channel
Dont worry, had to click 'disable motors' on the printer and then it was all good
Fw
I'm on tm3d's dw7 version of marlin fe
But I'm connected successfully and it's heated up
I get the error 'printer is not online'
Can someone help me with pronterface ASAP. Trying to fix a failed print
Poorly tuned but i plan on dousing it on filler primer
Pretty good, ive just started a mando helmet and its going alright
Check cooling. It only happened on the small parts
Cheers
I wish, i cant get it to run smoothly so unless theres a web based one im kindas limited
Heres the sword, i need the blade part to be 70cm tall so that i can print and stick it to a peice of wood for cutting
Its for a cosplay prop (the nichirin sword)
Would someone mind helping me create a template from a png/dxf file that i can print and have at true size
No
Bltocuh for a microswitch
Lol
yeas
dubstep
*This, ever.
*good.
fat oof
nah kyles got none
Ah github is great but i remeber stuff from listening much better than reading
Books are alright but i prefer listening to podcasts and yt vids
nO nEw FaNgLeD tEcHy GaDgEtS
wHeN i WaS a KiD
nice, just comented a few mins ago
youtube is very slow
ah fair enough
hrphm
nice, visual guides are usually better than text
its been 20m man wya
<a:eyeshake:422358943600345088>
what changed?
check sample configs
First layer I drop speed to 20 to 50 for the rest 100+
Is it worth taking the glass from a old door (large panels) or more effort than its worth
I love that mod
As long as the supply current is hogher than what you need its fine
In simplest of terms, voltage is pushed through, resistance pushes back, amps/current is pulled through
Spectroid
just subbed <@!173827530929733632>
i feel attacked
Guess ill be building a cnc sooner than later
That seems right although dunno if the probe repeatbility is indicative of the z repeatbility tho
Check z repeatability
Or your z doesnt move the right amount
Overextrusion mayne
Processing time and electricity plus prep time
14 bucks and next day delivery
Looks good to me
Hey i wasnt the one that suggested it
With thermal runaway enabled maybe not but its up to you
Mb i just saw weight saving somewhere and jumped in
Ah unfortanute
For the idlers i doubt they get very warm
Abs+ is also super runny at high temp so crank up to 300 and abs+ to get max flow
Swap pins for 5mm cf rods too
With all the small secions you wanna get to top speed immediately
Tune acell first then deal with top speed
And increase scv to 50 or so
Definelty drop top speed to 200 or so and boost acell
You have a sock on right
Not particularly, just something to upgrade later
But tune z acel and get another fan to point at the boat during print
200, 70k+ acel may be better#
Gaps
Also disable z hop and tune z speed to as fast as possible (acceleration wise)
Extrusion isues on the hull so slow the print speede there and get external cooling
But a stock ender is beating ya
Not too shabby
Pog
Nice, current ender 3 record is around 5 30 so im aiming to beat that
I but on the graph, do you want less spikes and all that or biggere more frequent spikes
Do you want less spikes and short spikes
Then on to laser/cnc shiz or filament manufacturing
Im looking at getting a delta and completeing the holy trinity of motion systems
Im building my collection, got one corexy e5 and a cr10 both modded but one much more than the other
Damn impressive
Wifi dongle ez fix
I would think underclocking it and having equiv compute power would run cooler
Usb c and 4k usb cam and maybe cooler temps
Man maze deserves a all knowing roll or some shit, hes a literal info god
You're the best
How'd you find out
Eh im sure a out of shape 14 year old can carry it then/s
*based off photos
Fair enough, would you be able to estimate or not at all, its a 15 year old printer so i think around the time you  were dealing with printers
Ah worht a try
I found a free one nearby
Any clue roughly how much a Toshiba 1650  would weigh
Hey <@!451709396280410132>  sorry to bother but you said you had some expeience with commercial printers
Bid too early and got outdone
<@!451709396280410132>  got outbid by 50p
For best results
Create a mount for it to be screwed into the block
And pla silk green 11
Abd petg of the same brand for 13 iirc
3 for two and 3 colours of abs going for 7 quid
Cheers
I mean physical components. I'm looking at a pcb and theres a ton of stuff thats fairly distinctive in looks but ive no clue what they are
Anyone have a library of sorts online with images and descriptions of elecgtrical components
Just magnet sheets
If your looking to reduce weight on the y by using a smaller block a mgn9h id the same weight as mgn12c
Its pretty close, jus a little melty
Bruh
No problem
<@!419235997356916756>  
Iirc <#747613009915936818>
Im stuck on stock for now but the e3d high torque or wantai 811 are pretty good
Hes a user here (<@!517992263784071172> dw just to show your username)
Or use an z offset
Set endstop position as +0.3 and zero will be equivalent to your current -0.3
Drop speed to max 300 and bump acell as high as possible to really drop times
Youve got the role
Its all good, you should still be able to acces the thingy
React here for beta secrets
The enclosure is pretty easy, alum panels/acrylic panels is what im looking at and a top hat can be designed or a ikea lak
Voron after*chonker* is heavy and large and i dislike its aesthetic
Eva
Yup, in the end if you canyt choose just ask here, you'll get plenty of opinions
Mercury is the current design, theres a few alterations to it floating around but they all work well
My kinda build still uses stock z and you could retain mostly stock parts if you want to budget
A lot of users have just started from a pro/plus and replaced the z or replaced the stock e5's z
It works on all ender 5's
<@!347144798102093825>
Try pid tune bed and hotend and what's your z axis like
how slanted is the cube
weird
oh sounds like the platge isnt secured, try slide it left and right
take  a picture with a light shining up from the bottom, it should make the wobble easy too see if its there
shifts or wobble
dayum. cheap
ebay.co.uk/itm/265225046445?hash=item3dc0a509ad:g:ROYAAOSw6iNg6MzS         ebay.co.uk/itm/265225042084?hash=item3dc0a4f8a4:g:GEoAAOSwAcxg6MtM       ebay.co.uk/itm/265225051660?hash=item3dc0a51e0c:g:XrAAAOSwi21g6M87 are these worth it assumig i can pick them up
nice
<@!173827530929733632>  might not be able to
Watcha cad-ing
Ill join in a bit
Ah, i would try get dalias on, my understanding is very surface level, i can try explain it but dalais is gonna do it best
But yeah. Later
What is it?
Can it be over text, with friends rn, or if its quick
Much nicer
There it is
Alrighty
Yeah, i did use kiauh to install it if that makes a difference
Everythings up to date, i dont see it
lemme get it updated
what orientation
Thats on 90 degrees inst it. On sharper corners it gets lower
Also sharp corners and during some infill
I recall being told not to
Nah that causes a lot of problems
Sure beats my chicken nuggets and fries
True but more steps to interpolate with is better. No real difference tho
And try 32x microstep
Under the tmc2209 driver section insert interpolation: true
What microstepping and is interpolation on
did you try the actual rms calc
maybe too low is the issue, try something higher on both
whats your holding current
no no, that causes a lot of problems and bugs,
No boron nitride, i think melty filament or friction
How do i get the block out
The wires snapped
Ah no, my heater got stuck in the block so i heated it up and tried pulling it out
Oh boy the printer is acting up and now is not the time, i gotta get parts printed and its decided to take dump and stop working
Ah nice, then no need to increase pa by too much
Also if your hotend can handle it .5 line width and disable gap fill, also aligned infill that follows the x axis will help a bit
Cmon. The one time yall are speedboating and im not even awake, also disable retractions, increase pa, turn up flow by 1-4%, increase scv to the 100's and top speed 300 and max out acell
Props to maze, fixed my problem quickly and guided me through every step
Not it
Nope
<@!451709396280410132>   i know where it went wrong, i had used mainsail os instead of installing actual klipper, removing and reisntalling everything now. I hope this it
Anyone up to vc for some good ol' “ì·¥ú…¥ troubleshooting
Yup. Eating and watching loki
Would someone mind hopping on vc in a bit to help me with installing fluidd and miansail and dwc2 (Ive got kiauh)
Nada, im gonna try unisntalling and fully reinstalling mainsail, will it remove my klipper config
I cant even connect through any web ui to do that so powering off and on again is what im doing
Alright
Do i need to restart
Do i insert fluidd into what its name
<@!451709396280410132>  is this right
Ah, check with <@!173827530929733632>  but you may need to have a confirmed zerog to access those channels wich is a bit meh if you know you're using them on your build but it is what it is
Does that work#
Thats right, weird. 
Did you rweact
wHaT a StEaL oF a DeAl
This is just to connect to mainsail for now
Also  
app.a86db3db.js:1 WebSocket connection to 'ws://mainsailos/websocket' failed:
Nice
Where do i press f12
<@!451709396280410132>  i added *.local to allow any of the links to work. It  still wont connect though
Riveting
'Readthedocs.io' meanie url
Thanks for the help
Ill unistall and reinstal them later
Uh oh
The what nows
I had mainsail os installed first then installed the other 2 with kiauh
<@!451709396280410132>  installed fluidd along dwc and mainsail and none connect
The inner part shouldnt move
Yeah
Try heat/cold a bit of oil between the two to get it moving
Oh sick
Which one
App?
No prob
Bruh whyyyy. Just donate it to a local school or makerspace or literally anything else
You wot. Ill take a rusty dusty free ender any day of the week. But yeah reuse electronics for triple z and use the leadscrew from it with a second free one plus wires and heaters and bed and tons of other stuff
I fell for that
It was a budget version. All stock hardware apart from some fasteners and idlers
Well you could recycle quite a bit of the ender 3 or port it to a square frame. But thats your choice and yeah the whole printer is built on vslot. Also iirc someone made vslot version instead of linear rakls
The biggest announcement was done through reddit and that boosted users but not a ton. Today we have had the biggest influx of users on one day ive seen
Nah we usually rely on word of mouth or Google. He just did a one off (probably) talk about it in general yesterday
With kyledavis?
Nice
These are all voron peeps?
Holy moly
From trianglelabs or e3d
Gates gt2/2gt
Lol my room is orse when im mid project
Idk, zipties seem pretty good to me
Naaah
Oh its asmwaome and a zoomed out nozzle cam that allowed you to selectively zoom in to parts of the vid with the super close up
But yeah not incredibly useful for the everyday person
Print defects and understanding flow better
his best vid is just someone elses with his intro/outro
you can run it without one bearing, mine are missing 6 due to an unfortunate crash
oh no they are terrible brakets so unless you want get them for aesthetic then i would advise against the,
ah so my use with 3 in each corner shouldnt allow it to flex
Weird. Mine were super rigid and pulled the frame into shape
Guess ill get the type I recommended then plus what I currently have
Hows urs screwed in. Mine has 2 screws overall that pushes it against the extrusion
Go for the type maze uses wich is steel 90 degree corner brackets
That was yours truly
The inside the channel ones
The text one?
Tsk tsk
Plugins again
Ah nice
What was that beta thing
Either way removing the hotend and acetoneing it
Although the lever is bouncing up and down. Dunno if thats normal
Its a clog, without a hotend I cant stop it extrusion no matter how hard I try. With hotend its cliky click every few seconds
Nope
You know what. I deserve that pin. How'd I miss that^ twice
I missed this thing during disassembly, twice
Its official I'm an idiot
Might join but im not sure
It shouldnt be slipping at 15mm/s
Getting new gears in now unless theres something I've missed
Higher current no change
Happens periodically. New gears might fix it?
Oh theres tons of filament dust in the tube. Ill try clean it out
Imma test with pla
Still really hard to push through
Nope
Mm filament dust
And I found out I need to increase motor current instead of guessing I found its spec sheet
I found out where my underextrusion came from
clicky leveling knob
Nice, good holiday?
Lmao already posted that
And that's only 7v over normal
Yup
Ah dont worry about it. Nothing went wrong and theres plenty of fail safes. Lemme show you what can happen in thermal runaway tho (ill go find the link)
Yeh rather than melt a block
Also reduced life span
More heating power means thermal runaway can melt your block very quickly. Not sure of the exact math but what wattage is your current heater
Just tried tuning pressure advance and with the Bowden settinga I had horrid underextrusion. On direct drive it was less so but still massive. It might maybe be that my gears need cleaning but are there any other cuases for this
F for ukraine, scor's 4-nil to england
What were you planning on first
Should write. A short tldr with a small codeblock example and pin that in klipper
And does that board use 3.3v
Are any components broken other than that board
Was there a short
Did a wire break
From moving the toolhead, weird, was it powered on
Ah cool
Stepper calxulator?
Nah 8 is right, im out of ideas then
Check the length of them and make sure they dont touch the frame
Ah on the rails, someone had mismatched screws and one was too long and it was turning the frame into a speaker, kinda
Mine make that noise at 100 (otherwise they sound like normal steppers at any other speed) but i think someone solved that issue with different screws. Im not sure whats causing that noise
And is interpolation enabled
Alright, just wanted to check if it was stepper noise or chatter from bad rails, are those .9 motors
If you move the rails by hand do they make that noise at the same speed without steppers
Go faster and see if it gets quieter
Also, record a vid of the noise, just to check it isnt chattering or a weird screw
The wantai 811 are pretty good, the e3d high torque are good and those ldo ones wich im not sure how you buy
Ah cool. Ur all good then
I would install a few of them but anything more than 1 or 2 in a corner and its Damn near impossible to get back together
It took 3 people to help reassemble the frame and those are weaker than normal corner brackets
<@188043401562685450> avoid those brackets like the plague. I installed them and trust me. Any other bracket is better
Im building a smoke machine, im about to buy a air pump, should i spend the xtra for a 24v one isntead of a lower voltage + whatevers reccomended for berd air
Heres the macro i ran before the print
Any other print is fine its just this
Finally got to tuning pa and im getting massive underextrusion
Alright, gn
Definetly not actual ringing, it should change position or be out of alignment
Its same as x but 2 of the idler thingies
Weird, that ringing looks too regular to me to actually be ringing
No rubbing either?
Un screw the one on the motor and run the axis side to side manually then retighten and see if that helps
Hows the y axis feel during movement
Ah should probably fix that but those arent in motion during the y axis ringing
So the belt moves up/down on idler
Are rubbing on their extrusion
The x axis belts?
Nice, the second my magnets arrive ill be making one too
Quickly check the belts for me, are they rubbing and if you decouple the motor do you feel any bumps or lumps at any speed mvement
Could the z be causing ringing aligned with the y axis?
Same at low speess?
Try reducing accel on x axis down to 500 and raise it on y then do the inverse and check wich gantry it is that rings
Normal orientation that it imports with?
And which gantry axis is it with rining
Stock e5
Is that corexy
Tried shutdown and powering it up again
Any error messages
You could do it but why would you, unless you need it for high temp or just have one sitting around
Well thats true the majority of sesnores that are cartdrige are the 104 as far as ive seen
For clarification- 104gt is default e3d v6 thermistor and the ntc is what the ender/glass bead thermisotrs are
For 3d pprinters response time is better than accuracy since the nozzle temp, filament temp and block temp can all be different to the measure (but not by much) so you want it to react quickly and stay within your set temp
The default is fairly responsive but if it takes to loong to respond you can reduce smooth time a smidge or check out pt100/pt1000 they should be more accurate and respond better
Apart from offgassing and it could harden into a cemet like junk, although it may become flaky or dusty
Jinkies
No problem, check the max temp of that thermal paste and check that it wont solidify
Damn. Ive heard of milled extrusions for flatness hut never the whole hevort
Pics?
Silicone sock? Also do the bed pid just incase
Causinf the bed to expand and contract with temp swings
Pid is tuned well
Hehe, out of context that has a veery different meaning
How di i get that
Does it need to be the same size?
Ohhh tasmanian devil
Who
Rudras extrusions^
<a:hypercatvibe:743208354192818238>  rudras frame be like
Lol your frame is having a fun time
Write 75 mm2 as a fraction of 1.2 cm2. Give your answer in its simplest form.
Google has failed me, it doesnt understand the question
And i do not want to know what the second one involves
Chillcastrinating is too close to chill-castrated
And he can be 'chillaxing, bruh'
Introduce him to 'chillaxing'
Lmfao
Lmao, your 7 yr old talks like a teenage london kid
Bruh ive been wanting to work since i got a printer
<@!173827530929733632>  with the power of child labour i have discovered i may be building vzbot AND merc
Thanka for the help. Didnt know i wqas able to work
Nearest one is 40m walk or a 10m tube ride but the tube adds up. Ill look at mdnald and supermarkets or the tiny corner store
I think retail is gonna be best. Aldi down the road and sainsbury around the corner, two corner stores nearby and a high street. Someone must be hiring
13 and 14-year-olds can work a maximum of 12 hours a week. They must also have a minimum of 2 weeks off work during the school holidays.
Wait nvm, i just checked, its 13 min. Time to get job hunting. Another joy i hoped to avoid
Nah im 14 man, til 18
Not legally able to yet. So next summer ill get a job so i can build a printer
Lol, im in year 9 out of 13 then uni
I really should stop complaining
But iTs AlL wAtEr UnDeR tHe BrIdGe
Thankfully summer holidays are in 2 weeks. Even though we did end of years 3 weeks ago and they changed the date to be right after A FECKIN HOLIDAY and gave 3 day warning
Yup. I cant wait to not be in school, although thats a double bladed sword
It was 8 and raining
Or WINDOWS HAVE TO STAY OPEN
Yup, rules semm to change on a whim FOR NO EFFING REASON. But im not salty that we had to wear coats inside because heating wont turn on
Lol no one cares anyways, last week we were allowed to wear a coat inside this week if you have it on its a afterschool for 1hr
If your in the hall and have a shirt untuckked or lanyard off then you get a pink sheet to hand in and they log it
Wdym? Every time you get a 'behaviour point' its put on a website
That got me a total of 1 hour of detention
Bottom one i had my shirt untucked and the top one i finished early so i was talking to a friend trying to fix their code
Bruh, we get a detention and second time its a after school
No kidding, i forgot to wear my lanyard and got a detention
'Missing equipment'
Lmao, if we dont have a calculator we get detention
Ive gt a RE test to get to aswell sooo
If its ez or ik it then yup
Nah not test but we get 4hrs worth of hegartymaths.com tasks each week
Idk kinda sounds like im lazy and not bothered since ive been doing this for an hour
Ez
I just copy the wuestion and click seawrch with google and i get the answer
Ik, google works great. Its just ive got 8 tasks like this
Fml
Convert 54 km2 into m2.
Bruh ive got 50 questions identical to this except different numbers or untis (e.g 5 mm/cm/m/km)
Its stocked by lots of stores. Also check amazon
Thats what I'm doing. Plus magnet coupler
True but considering its cheap and works considerably well its a option to consider. For z when you go cheap I guess its a pick your poison
Cheap ones and wobble wings seem good, talk to the hevort discord to find out how that works
Nah being sarcastic, no ones cultist, most users know theres flaws and just dont mind, every printer has them
i MeAn, WhAt Do YoU eXpEcT fRoM sUcH cUlTiStS
Ah cool, design/belts it is
I thought that showed up on a ton of dual gear extruders
Ah cool, also ill be testing a magnetic one on stock bed, ill post a vid of any backlash
You can desolder the switch from stock, andif it take sup too much space use a positive endstop position instead of zero, or if you home to max set it to something under max travel to allow the carriage to travel further than the endstop
Try a different sleeping position
Mines around 120 at 20mm/s, it goess up to 255 iirc
On my baodr theres a dedicated pib
I have sensorless set up but not the right pins for you. Also does your board support uart
What kind of client
What board
Hm
Ah nie
Lol, are you just gonna get a new plate
Nice
Beautiful print
<:GOBRR:858730968684298241>
Cheers
Also for steppers do I just connect the metal frame to the stepper case
I suppose I could drill a hole and use a bolt and nut and ospade
No nearby brackets, could I sand qnd solder the wire to the frame
Ground the frame*
Theres no uncoated screws near my psu so to groumd it whats the next best option
Best i can do is mpluaderdale or ruckusmattster or  matthew
Commands from the higher ups
That woulod be extremist, assuming god is anything
What about aethiests
Mpmatthew or ruckusmattster or matthew
And ive only got 2 other usernames
Sorry man, old name is kinda inflamitory, if im gonna be mod i gotta follow rules

Lol
The light blue is <:chefkiss:643937705910337536>  and the purple is nice, that yellow is meh-meh the green is nicer than dark green
I was about to say
Im really like the remodel
Topapod g
So thats what pod stands for, neat
Much clearer who does what
Dang im blue now, also thanks for the perm change, also im liking this remodel
2021 colourized: dutchdude promoting himself to engineer
BIG SUCC
Dang that's the
Nice soft light. I'm gonna mount it into the printer later
And the white is kinda blueish
Its not as bright as I hoped so ill be adding more strips but its pretty good
<@451709396280410132>. Wanna see my light box that the leds were for
<a:banned:852615477196881941>
Welp, back to my build
Sorry to be a nuisance
Man this is karma for buying shitty electronics
It was under some cheap plastic cover that broke off when i diconnected it and i didnt notice the wire
So i held it in place and it worked
A wire wasnt soldered on
The leds
It worked, wanna know why
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i hate cheap electronics
Brb
Alright ill plug it in and poke the 12v and g pins
Should i use that
Yes
Yup, i poked +12v and G and nada
Alright so i poked around the tape with no success but then i did on just the led and it did light up
Alright, lemme go try that
Positive to a 12
Ive only got a 9v battery or the 12v supply, so you want me to put the negative to a colour and the positive to a colour
Huh?
So nothing fancy
Yeah, these are the cheapest i could get
For now i just need them to light up, i can measure voltage drop later
Oh i think these are mono rgb, lemme link them
Ok so i changed the design to only use two short strips both have the arrows and both point in the same direction. Theres only a positive 12v no negative that i see and since its only 2 ive just dont 4 wires directly connecting them
Should they go like this or all along one side going all the way up
Quick question on how I should be wiring my leds
Weird, ik 100 percent gets funky and 99.5 is much better but 18 houldnt be a problem
Infill percent?
What was it before
A higher winding inductance means you will need a higher voltage chopping driver to maintain torque at higher step rates where inductance extends the current rise time each time the motor steps.

It's not uncommon to use for example a coil with an ohmic voltage rating of less than 4 volts with a chopping driver backed by a supply of 12 volts or more. Conversely, a 12 volt rated coil will have very little torque at speed when used with a driver which can only apply 12 volts.

The same motor chassis is usually available wound in different ways. For performance you generally want to chose the lowest inductance configuration, which is typically also the lowest coil resistance or ohmic coil voltage.
Alrighty
Alright, got a mic setup if ya need me
I can go root around for some headphones with a mic but itll take a while. Ill let you know if i find any
Yup, you could mount it really high up and have a extended lever too, it would be much less accurate though so keeping it low is best, and if you mount it on the corner of the bed you could ([possibly ) have the bed move up lower than the nozzle and pick up the probe and have a very small offset
Anything else i can help with
You could also use their mounting system and mount the the outside of the frame to reduce footprint
The main idea is metal magnets act as contact points and it slides onto plastic rail and locks into place then probes
As long as you make the mount for it you can make the dock and the pickup anything you want
Here it is next to a toolhead i beleive those are 4020 or 5015 fans
Yeah sorry
Nah sorry, no vc for me, i can sit and listen and screen share but no mic for now
Next to plo8n
Also i asume you mesn the quickdraw one with the magnets and clicky switch
I know a little bit, how much do you wanna know?
Yes but they suffer from cogging and need to be geared down, the new servos should have sufficient torque and speed while being easier to mount and with far less cogging
Vez
Nice, cant wait to see ya serial
Ah if you have people in mind then that works, good luck on finding the person
Fair enough, prefer a more personal method then?
Just make a aplication sheet

Congrats on admin
Tell me ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
Lol i was mod, then asked if i could add a bot and got a permanent promo aswell
Whats pod
Lolol, not for me
A very very small amount
Sleep now
Uhm. Ill try explain it tomorrow
Wait <@!451709396280410132>  are they're directional arent they, i just need to rotate thos strip
Oh yes
Unless thats what you mean
No, rgb colour strip
They are labeled, +12V G R B
<@!451709396280410132> , for once, nope
Lemme go test
And they are 12v
Didnt over volt, most applied was 9v accidently
Dunno how i killed them all tho
They wont turn on
<@451709396280410132> . bad news
Or something better
Their super cheap so white it just blueish but if I can figure out hoe to make my board control colour and not supply power then I can tune it
Are ya proud of me
<@451709396280410132>. I didnt screw up my leds
Was scrolling through klipper docs and look what I found @dutchdude
<@!173827530929733632>  for the reason you mentioned yesterday can i not see <#841750249089269800> or <#841750177383710780>

Belgium, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Canada, Chad, the Ivory Coast, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, France, Haiti, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Mali, Monaco, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Seychelles, Switzerland, Togo and Vanuatu
Although France isn't next door to many French countries
Ah cool. Its a same language different land mass thing. No problem just wanted to check if it were accidental
<@173827530929733632>. Some of those countries are languages 'german' and some are actual countries. Just noticed that
Also louder
0.9 has more back emf but allows for more resolution with less microsrepping
Dowels are much better
You can use any but the wantai 811 or e3d ht are solid choices
<@!267646137719062529>
The stock mounting will just be two screw hboles and then account for it height and tada
Wouldnt reccomed the afterchonker but it is whats compatible rn, you could design your own hotemd that mounts in a similar fashion to the stock

This discord
Bruh
Top layer needs 1 or 2 percent less otherwise its a great print off a ghetto ass printer
But a quick print can solve my ringing and pressure advance sooo tomorrow ill be tuning 2 rolss of abs for a order and then I can brag
So considering the tuning its pretty good
On stock z too
But plenty of easy ways to improve so for a 15m print its pretty good eb
No PA or input shaper and 1mm retraction on bowden
Best
Worst anglr
Forgot to enable pa
New bed, trying to tune it
And abs
Worst part is ringing but it was all 40k acc at 80mm/s
Hows this for quality
<@173827530929733632>
Does anyone have a reccomendation for abs/asa filament in the UK
Less lines since more plastic is coming out means faster prints and potentially stronger prints
hm, i have only used bare glass and abs slurry or hairspray
I keep my bed at 95, what build surface?
And at 60mm/s 0.72 is well within your top volumetric extrusion
And line width
Oh 40-50c
what hotwnd and do you have a enclosure, also what pattern. I got mine to print flat with 40% at 80mm/s
I guess his reaction to a top speed of 250 was indicative of his experience with those speeds (if that makes sesne I cant figure out how to phrase it better)
I only saw unboxing then went to bed
Damn it
The extruder can be easily relocated too
Dang the e7 looks so easy to enclose, all the elctronics at the bottom and 2 rails sticking up and everything except z is lin rails
Yeh o never see those announced
Ender 7
Hm
Astronomically high for whats outdated in resolution
But that price
Yeah the ballscrew is nice and the tilting vat shiould be standard, the frame base looks sleak af and that easily replaced caartdridge activated carbon filter is great
Quality
Nah a good cross xy
Arent the high torque from e3d best or the wantai
Bruh ^
What happaned
Its a step in the right direction but theres a lot of work to be done to make it good, the frame is great though
Yes although the belts are super low down and make for a terrible motion system, the z is cool tho
Huh, cant send messages there
Thats the de one right, its not muted for me
The heatsink cooling fan should have a thin channel next to it for the wires to route through (on mine at least)
*as tested so far
These or the high torque e3d steppers are best for speed
42BYGHW811
Lemme link them
You would be better off using the wantais
Asa
Eva compatability is being worked on afaik
The eva carriage sytem has many extruders
Well you might be able to keep the stock belts but you would be better off just getting new/nicer belts
Ohhhh, gt2/2gt 6mm wide belts
Why?
Iirc <@!294803722956046346>  has a similar frame but im not sure]
Damn, ender 6 really upped its game, the z looks nice with vslot and that frame <:chefkiss:851932715623907409>
Or describe it
Potentially, i cant find any good images of the frame, could you send one
The hinges dont allow them to bend more than flat although they have a small amount of flex
Do you mean a stl or a explanation of how it works
Well what do you dislike abour thw printer
So my dehydrator is very loud, it sounds like a rattling fan, im gonna print some feet for it but was wondering if a silent noctua fan of the same voltage or with a step down converter would be a worthy upgrade
I just did from left to right in thin slices and tossed then in some citric acid water to stop them Browning, should I add some sugar in and sprinkle cinnamon on top
My v6 with 235 on abd gets 15.6 with some underextrusion and works great at 14
Ice got some apples in rn
Ill try that later (we already have a ripw one on the windowsill) and ive got some cow/sheep shoulder to make into biltong
Ayy my food dryer arrived (cost 13 quid) anyone have favourite recipes or favourite foodd
Then you need it
Do you want auto bed levelling
Cheers, you guys are the best
Just a blank screen
Nada
Lets check vnc
Alright, klipper screen is insztalled
How about dwc2 and mainsail or just stick with what works
The website is fine i just prefer to have both
Ah, ill stick with mainsail then, i prefer fluidd on touchscreen and mainsail on pc
Cool, ill get fluidd while im here
Klipper
Also, I saw something about scurve/s shaping, should I use that or stock caliper
Once I paste the commands is that it
Mainsails
Nah

No harm leaving klipperscreen installed and not using it right
Alright, ill see if it works
Any way to make it do that or nah
I'm connecting to my pi via vnc viewer, but can't see anything, should I setup klipperscreen?
<@525391334102532100>. Congrats on contributor status
What on
Ya know what. Ill just not touch it
Sorry for all the questions
Well. Umm ill ground it and pur the lid back on and get my LED on order with a power brick so I can avoid dangerous stuff
Oh. 13kv. Not 13v
So don't touch the circuit but the output isnt terribly dangerous. So ground the box with the wire and tether the metal frame too
Sounds like glove time to me. Unless I misunderstand whatcha saying
So if its one plug per ccfl I assume polarity wont change since its not 2 wires on one bank of leds so I can plug them in (only goes in one way) in any plug that fits
<@451709396280410132>. Its a ccfl backlight of that's helpful
Thin
Perhaps. Its a large glass sheet with grey dots inside and on the edges theres 2 (per side) t00bs with a fat and thin wite going to each one <@451709396280410132>
Oh cool. Unfortanelty I cought the big dum and couldn't see it was tube light thingies not LED
The polarity matters now right
This is gonna be a pain. In probably gonna upgrade to led soon then
Those are incandescent or flourescent and what I thought was a led panel is just reflector thingies
Damg it
I think I made a oopsie
Possibly. Theres 2 thicker wires and 2 fairly thin maybe 24awg wires
Alrighty so ill plug in the 2 plugs and pop in a plug
I just cant figure out why theres 2 plugs to power one set of LEDS
Theyre dumb ones, the monitor was not exactly modern
And any clue which way round these plugs go
As in will they break if done wromg
Does led polarity matter
Also look at diy food dehydrators to get design cues
For continuous use or just to dry filament and then put back to storage
I think so, check the search bar
Iirc you chop some of the white part off
Baotd
L3d panel
Think I figured it out
<@451709396280410132>
This aint it chief
Disnt think of that. Ill let you know if it works
So on the mains in and then poke it around till it beeps
I thought for safety you lick the main power lines to keep the energy balanced ya know /s
Ok so I keep my hands away and stay back from the big fecken cap and sorry to sound like a broken record but run traces how do I do that (roughly)
Alrighty. Same for power delivery or..
Thought so. If I take some wire and solder ot to the case and to the new metal frame that will ground it all or to earth
And finally is it worth making a custom case to keep it small form factor or is it safer to use metal and ground the panel and case with some insulated wire
So. I have a monitor taken apart. In hoping to use its built in power to power a led panel but I dont know how to determine the power output lines. If not what could be salvaged. (Ill upload a vid in a sec)
Use a dremel and a sanding tube/grindstone amd spin in the opposing direction for double the rpm
Turns out I can turn it off, I assume you want me to do that
Yikes, I got better-discord for its google translate, I just clicked install all, the plugin translates foreign languages into English and lets me use custom themes. This was a plugin that came with it. Chill
vErY iNtErEsTiNg NeW cHaNnEl ThAtS bEeN aDdEd, WoUlDnT yOu AgReE <@!451709396280410132>
Sorry, just testing a plugin that tells me when a image was originally uploaded from google/reddit
Like a copy and paste but from google
Can someone send a image from google, anything at all, just testing something
unless you meant the orbital gears and I misunderstood
No, no, not the feed gears, the orbital gears
the gears wont see all too much acceleration on a average printer afaik
are they built from special materials so that they last longer even without lube but won't deteriorate from not being lubed?
are they load bearing or hard to replace
true but better to have too much then not enough
yup
i would go for the thick stuff, less reapplication and its not high speed
wich part
And our voron like belt path is best explained with the name voron
Theyre synonymous or close enough that people understand
Its like saying kleerox instead of wipe or builders tea instead of breakfast tea
accu is alright, and one other shop, lemme find them
A heavily modified delta printer with a ras pi on the side
dunno where else to look but amazon was equal price but wrong size and strength
alright, assuming sizing and price is fine this will suffuce, i will check for some local ones and try get smco's if i can
will do, otherwise these are fine
huh
and possible use them to hold my printers pannels shut
water and soap should be fine
best i can do is 220 or 90 or 400, ill start with the finest and work my way up til it works
cool
ill get a nice one with a logo then later down the line
fr4
eh ill order it now, reddit seems to like it, if its no good ill just slap some buldtak to it, or wait
whens it arrive cause i gotta get one soon-ish, also ill just nab a .8mm one since its fairly ceap
yuo
yeh its what i defalt too since my school decommissioned their printer with some sheets but ive run out
nah nah, for the ones you reccomnded
also <@!398242299080867842>  which gives the more textured surface
what thickness is best
cool
yeh i see it
oh and, hows polycarb
where would i find those
ill look into those, for now straight painters tape will have to do
altight, ill get a glass cutter and chop up a mirror
oh man, 21 bucks, glass is a lot cheaper, and buildtak
thanks
any reputable seller
true
do i need to replace the bottom magnet
so how would i install a pei plate
i can get something off aliexpress and use glass in the meanwhile but wanted to know if theres sopmething better
whats the fastest/cheapest way to upgreade it
so, ive never upgraded a bed on my printer
it didnt come with adhesive
whats a cheap/easy glue i have at home that i can use to stik down a buildtak knockoff sheet
NEW HOTEND HYPE
if it comes up again ill take a look but i suspect a window was left open and it got windy or something else, ive tightened all connections just incase
mot sure, heated everything fully again, twice and ran a short print and its fine
thank you
thank god, went out for groceries right after startinhg a print, dunno what went wrong since all temps sensors are reporting reasonable temps sooo
only edge
nop
just didit, ill try on chrome now
ah on edge
i remember someone showing how to convert a chrome tasb into a 'app' how do you do it again
i think its something to do with the a.aliexpress
although i tried the usual tricks and got nothing
this is cool
you meant the aliexpress links, lemme try
my bad
<@!525391334102532100>  turn thi9s off/click it
gimme  A SEC
nah its just in theater mode, i assume <@!451709396280410132>  prefers it or uses it defaut but you use standard
there ar other causes but these are the ones that have plagued me
incosistent extrusion can stem from many problems such as: clogged or damaged nozzle, uneven bed, too fast prints, bad filament tolerances, too loose filament grip leading to slippage, broken or funky extruder, too tight gears squishing the filament, clog in some other parts of the hotend, bowden tube leaves a gap between nozzle and heatbreak
hello
lol your incompetence, my belted z lost 100mm of travel
itll be the pinacle of jank
ill be trying to build a 3d printer to donate and for a competition (ill find one with a cash prize) a all (mostly) recycled 3d printer using parts from bins and refurbished things that are getting tossed out
but if i cant afford it
lol thanks, my next project (assuming i can amass the funds) will be to build a bar non all out beast of a 3d priner/toolchanger/something or other machine, i wanna have waterccoling with fancy metal tubing and a custom pcb that combines a spider and ras pi and has mounting hardware similar to a AMD ryzen 5 and it will have a bank of 360mm radiotors for passive cooling. and obviously odrive motors with a silent air compressor
cant loose what you dont have
lemme send a vid of my handiwork
sure, i actually have a 1.62mm drill bit sooooo
and the outside is polished smooth like the inventors brain
the bit wasnt long enough but i overcame it with a some flush cutters and sand paper
the inside is threaded
and bored out with a screw removal kit
its polsihed with a shoe (only leather item i have)
carved with some rocks and knife sharpening stones i have
so what do we think
Toolchanger is better
Didnt think of tjag
Ah true
true ( they may not replicate it), but 5k i meannn
pretty cool, lthough a vslot version of the merc 1 that rusn on mostly stock hardware could have won
Also happy pride month
Anything salvageable, the motor is up top with whatever else is in there
but it'll improve more tmrw
and made it cylindrical
i removed all threadas
oh <@!451709396280410132>  i have improved the nozzle
its gonna have the fattest nozzle ever
also imma try it again with a v6 nozzle off amazon
it aint done just yet
When I get my file kit im making a smooth brain version
Imma make it pointy and cylindrical
Just wait until I get my files
Mans got a new vice and a dremel and need to test it
<@451709396280410132>. 'Mwah'
Lemme send the link
Its not fully finished but I think you'll love it
I got a vice and dremel and a cheap nozzle is the softest material I jave around
Modified
But uh
Its just a nozzle
Cause I got some awful awful nozzle gore
<@451709396280410132>. Whats our policy on gore
i mean, yes like screw drivers and dremel and a couple tiles
bruh its just a room but with a bed in and then 2 printers and tools
my bedroom si my only workspace so its contantly a mess
livable
and those rails gotta be worth quite a bit sooo
i mean, your house cant be that messy
no no, cleaned out of your house and into mine
oh no, ill help you clean out those rails, $5 is reasonable for all of the is a good price right
Poggers
Ive got 2 19 inch diagonal bits of glass and one 23 inch diagonal peice
3rd and final peice of glass acquired. All I need is a old monitor and some LED and I can build my enclosure
i saw a petg once but it was too brittle
yep
their 3d printer is ocasionally in store
ah its only online
Ah I havent checked lidl, also if they ever re stock it, aldi filament is godly, consistent with clean matte prints and best of all its only 10 bucks
Nice
I go every week to see the special buys since they usually have pretty good deals on tools or paint or appliances
I think itd every store but if not then in the UK
I'm no pro but uh this doesnt look too good
So I'm getting a small vice and file set
Aldi is selling mini vices and file sets and helping hands for soldering in the special buy section
just thought 3 quid was a bit too cheap
ill buy a few then
nice
worse idea than me wiring up someones 240v house
But code os not my forte so I cant help too much
Everything should be on within afaik and they have alrightish documentation from what I can understand
Check out the existing pressure advance one
Poggers
thanks for the help
ah, as long as what im using is smaller than what its rated for im good
lower?
alright as long as both numbers are biger im good
if its rated for 5A 24v can i run it half the voltage at 3a
ill get a 3A switch
dope
its for lighting my enclosure and sometimes will use it while fixing the printer so i dont want to have the printer on to use it
nothing smart, just manual on or off
turn the leds on or off
or does it not matter
should it be a 3a switch for the 3a going through it
also any clue how to find the right spec switch
nah they shouldnt be
nah its to drop 19v to 12v to power a LED bank
if not ill buy
all i need now is some LED strips and im 80% sure my brother has some
THANKS
<@!451709396280410132>  is this good 
the only other i have is for a laptop but we need it
nah, we dont keep many, all the 12v ones are 600ma
12V
i need 1.5A according to the vid but i can always get a 3A
yeah i gotta get a 2A one
<@!451709396280410132>  this thing
Ill buy one then
Ah cool
Lemme send a video summarising it, (skip to end to see final result)
And it wont be strained since the leds will pull 1.5A and it can do 2.4A
Ah, but a step down converter would do thr same thing right
Is it possible to step down the voltage coming from my power brick with a pontetiometer inside (like printer psus
<@451709396280410132>. You seem to know stuff about electronics and how to not die
Also cool thing, xbox 360 and possibly xbox one power bricks deliver 10A and something near 12 or 20v so its viable to use for powering some printer parts
yup i got 3 panels from a old minifridge
behind glass panels
nah cant use its led since those are too warm and desgined for lcd, goota get some cri 94 or higher LED, so imma get some led strips and a old power brick to power it
and im gonna use it as a top panel in my enclosure
or ill find a monitor in a bin
Also will the merc1 support the annex rebreather
Close enough though
England
Close ish
Ah
Also 4 tmrw sounds good
Are you in America?
So its 11pm here so a time difference of 5hrs
Possibly, roughly what time tomorrow would you be able to though?
I run at .6
Stock steppers?
What motor current are you using
Which steppers
Yeah we do too (not to be mean)
Wich stepper
And toolhead
What steppers
Just got a little woried
No problem
<@188043401562685450>
Hey man you joining?
Lmao
Is it built to similar standards of my printer?
Ooo lah lah
Fancy you
Well well well
But just setting up arachne cura
Ill show it off if ya join
Sorry was getting my pc setup
<@!173827530929733632>  ready when you are for cura
Like diyperks did with a old monitor
In gonna try make a artificial sun to light the printer, also the mini fridge might be usable for its door (to have with its built in hinges to use as a sealing door)
All I need now is some led strips for lighting
The table I wanted was gone but oh well
Also found some nice square metal tubing for my cr10 to reinforce it
Little brother suggested looking inside a mini fridge while dunpster diving and it had removable glass panels so I took 2
Unreal engine 5 is unreal in quality
hmmm
after chonker
why not, everyone benefits, also im a mod there so maze and i can propose it and if everyone says yes then we can make a shared program where any provider in both servers print both parts
we can combine the program with a couple discords e.g the vzbot discord
also you could have a print that has certain features present in the printer design and it gets measured up and printed with a premade profile, also you can make people enter their country and who ever is in that country and is a printer person receives a notification and they can accpe tor decline
+a little extra or just enough to make it non profit
and in terms of colour you should offer both a single colour of whatevers available for cheaper or a set colour scheme for more
would money go to a general fund or direct to printer people
i would sign up to that
no problem
Also if you need any small parts or spares I can toss those in too if I've got them
I can slice up the parts you need and send you a quote and start printing
Sure thing. Ive got a bit of tuning to do but I would say a professional printer shop will have very good tolerance although more expensive
True
My build wont be for months tho
If <@787476079248932915>. Wants a set I'm happy to bang it out and ship it and depending on where he is I might be able to save on shipping though I doubt it
Ive got a full roll of abs and parts weigh in at roughly 200g so I could get a few sets
Well ive got to start saving but I might print out a 3rd set to ship to whoever needs
Eventually yes
Ive already got bits sliced and enclosure ready so no lead time other than printing
Oh I may join that.
I can also offer to do the parts for you but I advise the insulation or getting abs plus and some cardboard
Dependings on where you are I can send you som3 thicc insulation if you pay shipping
lool i just wanted to use the big text but its not very readable
i see your pfp depicts a gopher with buck teeth, very stereotypical dontcha think. perhaps you should correct that and stop perpetuating stereotypes, wake up sheeple its 2021
mispelt, meant fixed
you can only see 2 wires on the printer now
i fixed my cable managment
Lol mine's just spaget
I used to love those books
Oh my god <@188043401562685450>. Is that Geronimo stilton on your pfp
I do have a bltouch for the psu thi
I just put a inductive under the bed and move it closer to the toolhead until it triggers
Wait. The probe goes on the toolhead
What about a Corexy bed and toolhead for double the speed
to reduce acceleration in a print can i just lower the max limits
Ive got a few new projects to work on
Also expect a lot more jank in the upcoming week
Ill need it
üëã
I'm exhuasted now
Alright. Ill tske a look around
Cheers mate
Also would the motor be a.c. or dc power
Lol if I'm not repsonding tomorrow phone 999 and tell them I grabbed live wires
Like a deep whir but more air
Some clicking and fan blade noise
And a good cleaning
I'm thinking dry ptfe in the motor or maybe oil
Yeah just a generic fan
I'm thinking of using a custom blade design (whatever's quiet from the fan showdown series)
Any clue how to make a desk fan quieter
And far simpler for nearly identical output
Less fiddly knobs
I can see why
And they wanna integrate it into cura 5.0
Nope
I can send you my cr10 profile
<@173827530929733632>. Yeah open beta
It allows wall to be 50 percent larger or smaller than the nozzle for where its needed, o can show you guys some examples tmrw
Slicing is great for detailed parts and large nozzlea
Oh also fun thing, check out arachne cura for a much better arangment algorithm. I could fit 5 extra items on my build playe with it
Probably less than a minute
Ill lower ot then and reprint
Alright
Abs
For and 70
Damn I'm looking to do 125k on infill
Fair enough. These parts just gotta be functional
But I can drop it to 15
80mm/s 40k accel
Alright ill reslice with lower accel and try tomorrow, what's a more realistic acc
Point is if its okay after a couple hundred ms then its all good for 10
I can reduce travel to 100
80mm\s print and 140 travel
80 anf 40k for some Abs parts
Try witch the printer pff and on as fast as possible and check mainsail or fluidd fkr errors if thrres none you're probably fine
Got some stupid layer shifting and then perfect print after. Dunno if its from overheating or the usual mechanical stuff
Probably
Considering it was some football finals
So thats reassuring
Well I thought I did just awful on a English test but it turns out they were either drunk af when they marked it or I actually got top marks
Smh
They sent a email adressing complaints because people are already on holiday and my school responded by saying it's our time to shine
Yeah and they told us yesterday so ive got the holidays to study
Instead of 5 weeks time
Worst I have is my exams are right after this half term holiday
Dang that super sucks
Lucky bugger
Congrats man. Enjoy the time off
<@178418959853289472>. You just finished gcses right?
Look right to me. Dunno if the outer diameter I'd the right size tho. Assuming its all to size then that looks good. Although a assortment pack would server you better
Ill reiterate we can voice our opinions and are plenty happy to hear yours back. If you dont feel like sharing that opinion its okay, general probably isnt the place for it but eh. If you click my profile you can block and ignore any and all messages from me if you want (thanks for saying it wasnt just me)
Wanna see a fire hazard of a printer
My bad
My bad I thought you were saying ypu would like to share a opinion but disnt for the well-being of others don't feel pressured to share a view
also i love a hearty conversation, doesnt matter if we disagree since we can still agree on 3d printers
share them man, i couldnt care less, my views are very biased and i love the conveniences i have today i just wish it was more moral to use them. also i cant tell is 'Of course, you know everything so I'll defer to you.' compliment, passive aggressive or insult
Anyone wanna hang out on vc later and admire my dope ass enclosure
Ewwww quality control
We should get a PIF program
And my enclosure design if it goew well will have the electronics in a isolated box and a heated filament box and steppers outside the chamber
Water cooled hotend
not for sitiing around though
i guess for work its good
oof, 24 here, 19 is a bit chilly, no?
i played beatsaber and went for a walk and thats it
daaaamn
look who found the milk, after 10 years, youre back/s
yaes
ill probably be on vc later for a bit so if you're on then i can show you all its features
if ya ever need 3d printer advce im your guy ‚Å± ·µÉ·µê ‚Åø·µí·µó  ≥·µâÀ¢·µñ·µí‚ÅøÀ¢‚Å±·µáÀ°·µâ ·∂†·µí ≥ ·µÉ‚Åø ∏ ‚Å±‚Åø ≤·µò ≥ ∏À¢ ·µí ≥ ·∂†·µÉ·µó·µÉÀ°‚Å±·µó‚Å±·µâÀ¢ ·µí ≥‚Å±·µç‚Å±‚Åø·µÉ·µó‚Å±‚Åø·µç ·∂† ≥·µí·µê ·µê ∏ ·µÉ·µà·µõ‚Å±·∂ú·µâ

i just put a wire in a cardboard sheet and ran 10A ac through it
wait, aluminum

5mmbrim and hairspray
I HAD A FULL PLATE AND IT WAS NEARLY DONE AND READY TO SHIP
THE MERC
IM GONNA HAVE TO DO THEM 1 BY ONE ARENT I
AAAAH
ARE YOU KIDDING ME 3 HOURS OF PRINTING AND THEY WAAAAARP
<@!451709396280410132>  ive upgraded the enclosure, i think its atleast 30% better (also after 3hrs a steady temp of 33 degreees is reachede inside the enclosure and even with external help it wont go higher
i just want a excuse to go fanless and use a phat 380mm rad and some pumps with a rgb reservior
ah well, ill just get some fans
and drivers too
but the mosfets shoulod be cooled so why not use water
also is water cooling my pi, fets and board a reasonable idea (with a passive 280mm rad)
Today is swell
And a government development
Also found a building being torn down with carp tons of stuff to go through
Today is going well
And a better tile
Also som3 square metal tubes and conduit
Its too heavy for me to carry so ill come back with a friend to get it
Is it worth me lugging it home and cutting and sanding and using as a worksurface
Sealant/oil is cheap
Just came across a wooden table, its not Ikea wood too
i tried making a flex plate diy a while ago but i ordered 5mm thick aluminum instead of spring steel because ali sellers are very cryptic
so a delta of 7.5
10minutes with bed at 100 and enlcosure is at 27.5 degress celcius and ambient is 20
wait no it would
would a mag sheet on mag sheet melt
stock magnetic sheet and removable surface are probably made of cheese
oh crap, back to 100c then
oh cool, so the bed is able to do those temps but the bed may not have the power to get there
oh wait aluminum foil for the air hole
true, the aluminum also helps
and is there a real max temp for my bed or is it just as hot as it can heat itself
as if my enclosure will ever reach that
ah well this is just for a couple of parts for a 'client'  and i guess the bocked airflow and slightly elevated temp will help
im trying to get the enclosure up to temp and the bed keeps auto turning off
is there a way to force the bed to stay on instead of cooling down after some time
alright waiting for it to heat up then running a print
by the left motor cause my panel wasnt wide enough
air hole
heh
if the enclosure isnt airtight then it wont keep a good temp so if i heat it and leave the bede on it wont be able to keep up the tempo and will cool down until it settles at its natural max temp (from the beds heat)
if i heat it now and wait for it to cool then it should settle around its max temp right
i wanna have it get hot faster cause im impatient but i dont want to artifiacilly heat it and think its better than it really is
after 5 seconds theres a 2.5% increase in temp according to where my temp sensor is
alright, enclosure test time, is it okay to get the enclosure up to temp faster with a hairdryer or woulds that skew results
my bad
wait i just had to restart
ive got a min temp and sensor pin and defined the type
yup
also how do i get a temp sesnor to show up on the temperature graph in mainsail
or melted
Mine always arrive squished or with funky lumps
looks like a pro v1.2 but even fancier with more ports and more io also a better more modern feature set
the minimalistic black and white and intimidating octopus just looks so serious and the word octopus in blue loks so snazzy
i like it more than the spider
oh dang that looks fiiiine
Ttime to see how it performs
Cheers
Whats a really warpy object that wont print without a enclosure
Anywho gn
Clear petg with 2 panels and corn syrup in between for clarity
Ill scour every building site nearby for more ghetto solutions
Just you wait. Its getting late here but tomorrow I'm stepping up my game
A plastic shot glass and cardboard holds the roof up
When you see the rest
Its gonna hurt more
With a showing of. How well it works with temp sensores for proof
Tmrw we can vc for a full tour of my quality hinges and design choices
That's one exposed corner
See the red part with a motor
Inside
This is just to print some parts for a guy on the server and with the money o get from that ill be getting some cooler switches and cooling plus maybe a few heatpipes
My v2 enclosure will have a proper filament storage and electronics box with every bare wire covered in heatshrink
And I make sure they have gloves on
I'm ticket terrified ill short something
I have someone else plug it in for me
Riiiight
Right
Quality
Yeah
Ill make a vid for YouTube pretending I'm serious about it being goof
Quality
Hehehehe
Hm, I might just glue them all to each other and then glue them to a table for a cheap and lazy way. Ill try it dry first
Well there is a fat sheet down the road
I'm planning on using s mdf board as backing and just laying it on the counter
The caulking?
A bit deeper than a e5 and 4 e5 long
Flat
And in my case, freeee
Cheap and very resistant to abuse
How would I tell
Sounds like it
Kinda but with tiles from a bin
Tiles instead of wood on a workbech
For cleaning and scrape and acid resistance
Do you have any tips for a tiled worktop
Lol
Lol this server is fairly light and joky until it gets real political and then back to normal
Kids like phones to good olds days without phones to me saying its not 100 percent kids fault they need phones to industrial revolution and modern civilisation making poor choices leading to a underdeveloped and ill supported generation
Especially since 1 tile wont cover the full bench front to back
Hey thanks. Im about to try make a tile countertop since they also have free tiles. Any tips for thaf
More poor decisions by mega corparartions leading to this
100 percent. Its no one persons fault
Also I don't like the outdoors
And removed our independence and wouldn't allow us to be out of our parents sight and sure as heck wasnt our idea to make parks large flat grass areas, not that I'm allowed out after dinner to meet my friends there anyways
Also not to blame you but it wasnt us who industrialised every single bit of land and filled it with people and didn't build strong enough infrastructure to support those people then drilled it into kids heads that they could be kidnapped at any second
Nah I usually dont know where mine is
I got a leg up with starting fresh in the hobbie. Instead of saying I could do it like this or trying to do it the wrong way I just take on board whatever's said as truth and do thay
These youngsters amd their new fangled tech. What happenes to the good old days
Most of what I know is the resultant stuff. Not why it happens. Like not oiling your rails after cleaning makes them rust. Onky just learnt it because the cheap ones arent stainless steel and therefore rust without protection (theyre usually carbon steel)
Ah my bad, 6 year
Then thats a 8 year gap. FAT OOF (just kidding it doesnr matter who know more in the end, you probably know how to do wiring or firmware better than me and mist definitely CAD better than me)
Assuming uni for you works the same as me
21/22 , right?
My condolences
Lemme check
Lolololol
High school
Most messages sent leaderboard
12 at night here
I'm gonna be adding quick connectors and a snatch block setup on a rotating anchor to lift and move heavy machines, in trying to get a locking mechanism that lets me stop pulling but keep the machine suspended
Also designing a bit more kf my workshop
I'm already in bed, I spent today doing home work and enclosure
Cheers
Lol same, ive got to sell some parts and buy some switches and other jubk for my enclosure then spend the week building and revising
Thank God I'm a kid and have 0 responsibility or commitments and can spend hours mindlessly reading discord
He left or got banned from the server( <@451709396280410132>. Was he banned) ive seen him around other servers
Yup. Reddits alright if you stick tp hobby subreddits and discord great if you knkw where to look
I just don't see the point in sm. Sure its nice for the occasional chat and meetung new peeps but overall its just weird
Ivw only got one for my vr headset
WWdym
/s is easier
Ive got a big flat 4m x 4m sheet for a nice painted aio build with filament storage. This is just to get some parts printed so I can sell them and make moolah
I just slapped some cheap foam on and put catdboard where needed
Lol you think I dis anything in cad for this
Hi tech
Enclosure
Lololol I just got really lucky with one massive cast alum bed for my 10s pro and my e5 is fairly warped but I love manually leveling it
I finished my enclosure, and just added the finishing touches
<@451709396280410132>
Wanna see some hi tech not ghetto stuff
Oh maaaaaze
Cheers
And just engrave a phat one on the tiles, also can I cut tile with a handsaw or would a hammer be better
I'm gonna do the logo in black and background in red with a slightly overlapping 'ghost' of the red one
And spray paint/emboss it on this
I'm gonna try engrave it on this
Can someone send me a high quality and large photo of the zero g logo
thanks, it really helps for prototyping
I have a cube I use for reference that exists in all my designs, line up the size and perspective and you get a real sense of size
<@585125364276133898>. Did you keep the parts you removed from the printer
And a bank of switches by the psu to turn power on and off to the boards and pi and for the mains
With pcbs on top of eachother
Maybe the side is best with a insulation box and space to exhaust air either side and a stacked design
I'm thinking a lid that slots in and a door in front on hinges with the electronics coming in from the middle although the bed might be a problem since I would need new, longer wires
Red and black it is with a logo
And would it be stupid to have the electronics mounted in the top somehow
Also I'm about to start my enclosure and decided to spray paint it, whats a good colour scheme
For power and and data you could use it on the hotend fairly easily just be breaking out separate pins
Ah I see
Wdym, a cable with power delivery has no programming
Well why not a usb c its new 2.1 standard does 240w of power
And a new house is setting up scaffold so I may get even more free stuff
Oh yeah and I got 2 free tiles
That means it somewhat contributes to fires and is combustible
With a EN13501-1 Class E rating
<@451709396280410132>. The insulation is 75mm pir stuff
Yeah ut doesnt have that but I just type m84 in anyways
Biggest differnce for me is that fluidd wont show the fr and voluneteic flow in real time whereas mainsail does
mainsail
Also whats thr enclosure look like
Why not have a small glass peice for the lens to go against
Crazy talk
Psh, responsibility other than printers
Why not a heatsink and fan with heatpipes going into the enclosure
Since the gantry moves a lot it will try focus on it with autofocus
Fixed afaik
<@!472000729872334857>  you didnt do the @ thing]#
greetings
for glass try a very thin layer of slurry and or fo a less nice bottom layer trie salty water and letting it evaporate though the bed heater
would anyone wanna share their prusaslicer profile, mines tuned for benchys at high speed
Lucky
Ive been veeery
My aliexpress order usually arrive in half the time promised or sooner
hf
crap
oh
ah is that where you tig weld the abs to a aluminum sheet and use a angle grinder to cut it off after
I though5 its the other way round hot layers like hot layers
Ive got a volcano block with a v6 nozzle and spacer on a full metal microswiss that's rigid mounted
I mean if you dont mind a potential easy its worth trying
You've seen my idea of safety, theirs is gonna be safety squints and looking away
I dunno but that seems like a less than good idea
That would be so dope but with small people
I'm torn between a small high speed delta or a upgradr to a vzbot built properly in every way possible
Also get a flag or something for tuning speeds you can watch it stutter
I should hope so if not a volcano block would fix it up. Whats its max volumetric flow
<@451709396280410132>. Perhaps pip program in place
Oh nice, thats as some I try so talk later
All merc1 or afterburner bits
I can probably print them if you pay shipping
Also abs+ green for some warping prone bits and purple abs for the rest
<@274968498210603019>. Which part of england too?
I can print and send them if you dont mind a small wait while in get a enclosure built
Which parts
Congrats <@173827530929733632>. We have a full .step release with BOM in the works and thats pretty dope
Or for everything
For steppers?
Try a 
3rd
Nice show a comparison
Or filtered out
Yeah I would think those vibrations are absorbed by the toolhead
Angry
And I wanna know what the v2 means
Ah nice a trianglelabs dragon should be pretty good
I think I'm getting mine for 20 with a thermistor and heater and screws
Nice
So its ¬£50 or so
Those are quite good, how much does it cost
I think its a mosquito clone or something
Nice. I'm about to get one of these
Just longer rails and some homing stuff iirc
Yes @scrogth has done one and so have a few others
Nice
Our serial system is just like the vzbot one
Lmao good luck winning/s
Oh I just figured if my hard drive gets wiped by magnets then maybe eeprom
Try btt support
Yeah I'm stumped
but if it is bootloader (did any strong magnets get near it, iirc eeprom can get funky with magnets) then you just have to flash it (best i can do is say find a guide)
if they look kinda funky you casn try bake it
well are all sauter joints in good condition
the z stepper can be outside too if i make cutouts or a flase bottom but i want the extruder and xy to stay cold
so the steppers are open air and not inside the enclosure <@!188043401562685450>
kinda like this, all i need is the insert that holds the material and i need the material, no clue what it would be
Lemme try draw it in a sec
Nah I got my steppers mounted above everything else, I just need a way to have a seel that will lift off for removing the enclosure
if my steppers stick up and i waqnt to build a insulated chamber, how would i make a seal aroumd them tghat can be lifted off
This is too much
I trust this as much as I trust my wiring
Same people same words
If you refresh thw comments just repeat over and over
fairly trustable doesnt mean you leave it unattended without a fire alarm
i kept stepping on them and falling over
nice
in the meanwhile do the things your procrastinating on, e.g firmware or cable managment or a enclosure
on aliexpress, they seem to be one of the best cheap but quality rails
if you dont mind the wait try usongshine
have you bought them yet
mine were 25 for 3 aqnd a spare block
why
120 lin rails
should be fine having a bed larger than the heater but you will have colder edges than the center
not at all, if its a higher watt heater it will heat up faster if the psu can handle it
Manufacturer Standard Lead Time
11 Weeks is what the page says
if you wanna buy from aliexpress go for a 40A one so it doesnt catch on fire
kabbom, voron approved on a trustable website and a omrom (good company) product
crap wrong link
hm, gimme a sec then
most of the power will be to switch it on or off and wiont be high power since all the actual power comes from the wall outlet
No prob
Can you even do that, ive gotten good results from 1 to 50mm/s
Oi thats my printer
Huh
yes. it was on the news, he fell on australia
ah well, i  can just spend a little extra time making it safe
i have a shed/workshop i dunno if that has to really follow those kinda rules
so its possible, niiice i can plug my printer into the wall and watch people fall over themselves telling me my electricity danger is ac power and not my questionable wiring
forgot about ground or earth, oops
if you could get it down to one it would be more convinicing since theres no way (as far as mos people know) to do ac and dc from one outlet
so it could do one plug with 4 wires and 2 power outputs instead of 2 wires and 1 output, but why bleed?
ohh and have a ac bed shown working properly that wired to the ac side, could you have ac and dc coming through one wire if you used a weird wall plug?
oh it would be comedy gold, and it would be pretty hilarious if someone plugged a ender 3 board and all that straight into a wall, unsafe but very funny
that would be pretty cool to have a psu-less printer, extra points for maikng a 'wall outlet' thats wired directly to the printer just to mess with people, you can show them a vid of the printer being plugged into the wall and just magically working on ac
yup
the 24v ones will work fine as long as you dont use ac on it
Since it was designed for 120v and you want to do 24v ir wont heat up much but I think you could supply a dc current
If its meant for mains I dont think so iirc
thanks
topology optimization time
what screen is that
cool
are they any good, i ordered some parts a week or so ago to build this with
they should be fine to be printed in abs as im fairly certain they were already scaled accordingly
nice, i was baout to order a rail from there, just a short 100mm one for testing
Nice, what seller?
im gonna get a crap ton of plugs and spades in a assortment pack
ohh cool, ill see if i can find any
wait, those are a thing, what would a serch term be for them
building my collection so when i need needle nose i can get emm but i would rather have th right tools for the right job
dont have any so if im buying tools i may aswell get the right tool
as if i can afford those, 11 bucks and whatever some crimps cost is affordable
amd will this catch fire
what kind of crimp would i need for the plugs used on printer boards
Well if you thread the plastic it makes a awful squealing noise
Woop woop
We have 499 people in the server
Oh crap
thanks for the answer, that does not sound like fun
so does that food just chill in your stomach until you take a supplement and then you have a massive spike in caloric intake or will it do the usual rounds and get pooped but without any nutrients being absorbed
if you dont mind, could i ask a question
also im fairly certain glass sloly 'flows' so it wouldnt immediately bend
ive had some glass that bent a good cm or so (but that was when i stood on it)
thermal pads will fix that air gap
well nevermind
does it persist even if you raise the corners, it looks like the knobs are too low and the bed is warping to compensate
printed parts, 4 or so idlers or a complete new set of bearings, pins, some fasteners and some dry lube and i was planning on usongshine rails
but im gonna try get some new motors and try get some quick disconnects and a separate box and ecause i found some glass panes in a skip and some insulation ill be making a b-tec enclosure
lmao
Ive got some holidays coming up. Guess who's gonna rebuild the v0 with new grease and finish the electronics as best I can
Just checked and its 29
The oldest converison I remeber is 1 quid is 1.32 euro
I wish the btt octopus was 10 quid. I could choose between fish and chips or a new printer board. I would be upgrading stuff left and right
It got fucked by brexit
Probably 28-30 quid
The pound does not have that much power
You wot
Without buying something too costly
Well its probably a very niche use case but I would use that to add a ton of fand without straining my board
It has a mcu too so its a independent board
But with heaters/fans only
Afaik its like a normal board
Ya know I might have to find some more sites with a price match
matte pla/tpu or filled/fiber filaments???
hmmmmmmmmmmmm
if you wanna check that the holes are right just find a mgn rail and cut off everything but the hole spacing then check it screws together
would make sense, it had some other precision ratings the mgn12h didnt
how long is the block
afaik theyre the same according to some spec sheets i found
how come
i guess bigger hole spacing
hh?
guess ill be buying some if 4wd arrives
oh dang, i thought it would be a lot harder than that
oh wait so it just straight up works on the dm542 with no niggles to work out
as long as it wont need you to make a lot of changes fw wise
would you mind slapping a second motor on there (not connected to printer) just to see if theres any change in print quality or if it works, if it there is then we can rule out just using dm542 instead of series or parralel
wait,is it you getting the dm542 or is it someone else
But I'm no coder
Also a simple external splitter would suffice but with these newer boards I don't see why it would be too hard to just say send this signal to pin 1+2 and this signal to 3+4
Yes
4 wantais would be beatiful
Would be very pog if we got it tho
Ive been tooting this trumpet since v1
Bruh
16
well, for the masses of smooth brains like me it would be a epic video, a small bit of solid editing and concise voice over montages and boom, good video
fair enough
also if there arent, you should make one
ah cool, just wanted to see if there was a yt video on it or how to build it
Ah so the quick connect was just a obvious choice kinda thing. I'm trying to find other designs and videos on boxes like that
original idea then?
<@!451709396280410132>  that external electronics box you were making yesterday, is there an inspiration for that in the 3d printing hobby or is it knowledge translated over from  a different community
Looks like ill be buying a new rail for testing then dismantling and regreasing the printer
So I flush it and spray stuff in there
Cool
I just shove it in there
So would that be it then for regreasing
Weird right <@451709396280410132>. It looks like it keeps going into the green section
Lemme get a pic
<@451709396280410132>. The hole doesnt have threads it just keeps going
Also lower layer heights are so impractical but so beautiful
Also any clue why a lower layer height has much more prominent ringing
Ah dang it. Ill buy a short rail and use the block from there to replace a crap one on my printer and test grease on that
How would I flush it tho
Ah. What would the grease hole look like
I thought the 2 screws next to it were to hold it in place
Uh oh. Maybe ill try a couple screw after my print finishes and see if any fit (eta roughly 2m)
Hey same I tripled my salary. But 0 times 3 is still 0 (not a bummer tho- just cant legally work yet)
That hole in the middle. Just to make sure
Ah. What else would I look for <@451709396280410132>
But I dont know how I would flush it without making a mess of my printer, especialky for using a dry lub (later on)
Theres a small hole on the red peice between 2 screws if thats what you mean
Also is there a printed took for injecting lube into the hole on linear blocks
I was thinking just buying a 100mm rail to test but there must be a easier way
Whats a good way to test a grease/oil without regreasing my printers rails (requires full disassembly)
unless....
jk
now i can have a lightweight bowden extruder
guess ill be building it
much less than sherpa
how much does it weigh
it allows the brass nut to wobble around but keeps the bed/gantry completely stable
so i may aswell use a layer height that keeps my top speed within my limit it doesnt matter
printiing time stays identical
if you keep volumetric flow identical between layer heights, e.g scale speed and layer height
oh hey wanna hear soemthing cool
not much but hey ill take it
surprisingly ive lost weight over quarantine
Lmao
So uh. Animated icon and some livestreaming tonight with our hq audio and video
<:this:844139463419887618>  is great. Thank you
Lol I was just typing and you got to the send button first
Hey now that we have teir one can we get that :this: emoji from the annex discord. Its quite useful
we get animated server icons, higher quality audio, custom banners for invites, high quality live streams and more server emojis
poggers
Congrats
Psh only 14. Man up and use 28awg like man. Big number=big wire
Good luck
You da best. But seriously I gotta fix my wiring
Hey <@451709396280410132>. Would you mind sharing a fuckton of photos of that electronics box when its done
I think my psu is but I have guests and tweedledumb and tweedle even fucking dumber walking around poking my printer
But if I know it will work and its well rated even with 30 percent headroom for chinese crap. Is there a reason to buy the 5 quid Ali connector vs the 1 quid connector
Hence the separate plastic box that isnt metal or conductive and quick disconnect
Is there any reason not to get the cheapest connector on Ali vs a expensive but identical looking one
But from the box out ill do quick disconnect
Psu to where? I plan on everything in the box being stock
For heaters I just nees a high rating. Noisy connectors don't matter. But for thermistor I want something a little nicer
Bur I think ill be fine. All I need now is 48v psu and connectors
Reasonable enough. Oh yeah ivw mixed up a.c. and dc a few Times while sourcing parts
Yeah I want a separate box. It sounds silly but it feels more fun having a separate box, anyways I'm fine with everything inside thw box being not quick connect. I just need everything going to the printer for control to be quick diaconnect
Also is there any guidelines I should generally follow when it comea to connectors
Dang. I gotta step up my game and get better cable management. Are you guys using all quick connectors for power and outputs, only thing I dont know how to quick connect is thermistor, endstop and steppers
yup, just reach reaaaal far up there, while you're there grab me some servos
just dry it
my bad
Oops
Its not faaaaaair
But I want to go to see the multi million dollar company that stifles creativity and over works its employies
Lmao
He said he had a proper problem
Nah I only use one account
Idk thi
I think that's the wrong link
<@141593844788494336> ?
How much were those
<:midline:747887005295312947> üçû üçû üçû
Pog
Going to a theme park today
üòó
Night night
Anyway I actually gtg sleep
So its gonna be empty af
Everyone else is at school but me and some friends all got the day off and today's the first day the park opens
Not this guy
Guess whos not goinf to a theme park tomorrow
Nighty night. See you in the morning.....unfortanelty
Gn
<@141593844788494336>. Its 11 30. Time for bed little buddy
Not with that attitude you cant
Crazy getting home and typing his roast in then @me
Eventually it will
Oh yeah. Congrats on the design crazy. The cad looks super sweer
Although I could brute force it using a cfd simulation
Yeah I wanna try too but um. My cad design skills arw lacking
Some people made fans that are actually superior to noctua when the only change is blade design
Saw that earlier. Did you see some fan designs beat noctua on their own fan
Oh mines a teeny weent closet
Ah good. My laundry room gets to around 40 to 60 percent if everything lines up
Or ventilate
I hope you use a dry box
Its gotta get humid in there
Oh no
Just get a small mesh like a lint trap from a dryer
Phew
Air has to get in somehow and if the only outlet/inlet is a fan port then the fan is gonna start slowing down
That's not great for the fans performance unless yoy have a leaky enclosire
Ah yours is just pull
Thanks. But its from pc building. I'm planning on a high performance efficient push fan and a smaller noctua to pull
But I will be cautious in the summer
Thank fully theres a few air conditioned rooms and one vents into my room
But I do see your point
Cold
And my area is usually very cool
Hottest temps were 31 and that was 1 day for a hour
Well tbf. I'm in england
Oh I put on gloves whenever I do a first power on. And use a fused outlet with a gfci switch
Ok. Sounds like I should change nothing other than a new top box and keep the same fans and get a second fan too cool elctronics
Well. Time to rethink my plan
So no fancy features
And mines a landy
I'm replacinf them with quiet fans
And I've got some spare 2020 on hand. Thanks For the idea
I dont plan on fully removing it. Just using it and another fan to cool my entire electronics case. Ill do a push pull. With a large push and a smaller psu pull fan
Nice. Guess I know what my next project is
I see. So I can do that and cool everything with one fan
Oh
Phh
Wdym. The black box that comes stock
Oh man. I'm really considering a separate control box with psu inside. Can I remove the psu pcb from its case and use a giant fan to cool it and all other electeonics inside my case or should i keep it as is
Cheers
For speedbenchy ill do 15.8 and normal ill do 14
Not even all metal or copper
That's pretty good. Above the average and only at 235
Not mm/m
I use mm/s
Oh my bad
I cube root the number right <@178418959853289472>
At 420 it pauses periodically
No skips and smooth extrusion
Ok so 415 is a safe value
So it wad skipping
Yeah and im on v6. I dropped down to 400 and its gone
Lower speeds
Alright
Oh my bad then. Perhaps it is too fast
I get periodic stutters in filament movement at just 600mm/m
Hm
Or that i know of
Afaik
Not recently
Or is there something else to look for
So I should be hearing some skipping right
Cheers
Yeah you just back down a bit. Best ive ever got was a on a 1.7mm nozzle a friend lent me and a volcano and I had around 50. How do you get top speed from flow rate
Cool
Thats just my loading speed for my extruder
Alright
And that my max volumetric floe
When it skips I back down and times by 2.405
So I do g1 e100 f3600 or more until is skips
But how do I calculate max volumetric flow
I remeber doing this on my old cr10
Mmm. Good stuff
Unsupportes rails
Smooth
Wanna see some bad ideas
Moving on
Great story
Okaaaay
We beleive you
Yep
Totaly
Mhm
Sure
Mmmm. Yah
Yikes
Alrightm my bad. Whats a good acceleration for a stock creality extruder motor for ABS on a e3d v6 .4 nozzle on a fairly short Bowden on a knockoff bmg extruder
Whats a good extruder acceleration
It somehow does both
Yep
If you want strength I dont reccomend silk. It shrinks after leaving the nozzle and give bad layer adhesion
Me?
Nah dark green is awesome. Like pine green paired with dark purple or pine green and brown
Character
For
Gotta get that scratchy lumpy badly wound filameny
Eww imagine getting filament similar to the product photo
Shame
Ah
What about wizards voodoo from fillumentum iirc
Yup
Yeah the actual glass is magnets and silicone i think
Wrong way rouns
Crap my bad
Metal is on weak magnets that push the metal heater into the bed but are weak enought that when you level the bed you arent warping the metal
But I do actually have to do it
Heheh
Looks clean
Its so I dont forget it
Pretty good quality
Laser engrave whatever spring steel you print on and push the pei into it to have a outdented shape on your prints. Or just laser engrave
Also looks fairly light. Perhaps make a speedboat entry
Dang that looks good. Are you gonna machine that plate to have that shape in it or is that just on cad
So, what's the final CAD look like
I know that too. I used this since it was quick change (kinda) and needed quick acces to the print head
Ill be taking a EVA and using topology on it and comparing that to my custom one
Fine fine. ive made up my mind on what I'm doing
Yup but didn't want to swap toolheads just uet
Ive thought this through and I know what I'm doing
I will be changing to a different toolhead and not polishing a turd and will be making it a massive block with mounting holes then using topology to reduce that into a lightweight toolhead
For my use case it sure is
Nah I forgot to tuen up flow
Its 2.2 toolhead
I'm making a hevacs style system
No top or part cooling
Nah I'm using less than 100
I dont use the part cooling built in. I'm not that big of an idiot
Pog. Got the 2020 removed and belt pur back. All thats left is to test it
So with topology you tske any existing hotend and just process it
Generative design is harder to do and creates plastic in between essential points
It reduces the amount of material and keeps the essential parts
Has anyone tried topology optimisation on the afterburner or custom mounts
Yes buying is more efficient and yes its gonna be easier and cheaper to buy. But I wanna get better at soldering
Yep. But I gotta figure it out sometime
The board is my experience
May as well get experience and figure it out
Nop. Good time as ever to short circuit a board eh
Hmm I may build one of those if I can source the parts for cheap and try wire it and solder it myself
Dunno what it does tho. Aa far as I can see the smart effector is just a light pcb effector
Duet has a smart effector for delta that I know of. Nitrams using it
Depending on how you tool change you can use flat pins like usb that slot together
Thats only 2 less on my hotend. But anyone with part cooling and a dd would get better use
Mount to stepper
Oh wait. So companys just build their own boards. That would make much more sense. Easy repairs, cheaper, well suited to application, high quality when it needs to be, custom features and parts
Well probably massive breadboard but you get the point
Bruh that would be wild watching a printer zoom around with a teeny weeny breadboard powering it
But for our hobby theyre kinda irrelevant especially considering most printer are still sub 1k
I would imagine the ability to take a broken printer and2 drop in a new board that needs no external electronics makes for quick repairs. Partnered with warranty and a gurantee to just work. Kinda like apple
Nah I think duet is alright. But not for our hobby use case. Proffesional company's would benefit more frome a duet board
for wood and metal, time to clean up a cut on my 2020 profile
i got a 24/18/4 TPI handsaw
my tool collection grows
i know that guy, thats me
But if we do get a shit post channel. May I be crowned king shit and get a role that makes my namr brown. Until someone dumber comes along
Ive had my fair share of 'close one's but I'm fairly cautious. I managed to build a bar out of pallets without losing too many fingers
But I agree we need a shit posting channel or a stupid questions channel or bad advice channel
I know jack shit other than im not qualified so I'm sticking to low voltages or using high voltage with a jacket and gloves
you know, im alright. wanna hear my wonderful new idea
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahah. i am not
i nearly drilled into my leg yesterday
what are you on about hmmmmmmm
use a step up converteer for the bed to 48v and start melting the bed
skr can do up to 29v and so can 2209s, but your heaters, easiest fix is reduce duty cycle time
i just use a slot on my psu and a 5A capable step down, i stack the main board connection and pi
ah, thanks
welp, may aswell
no on the hub
something to do with cancelling vibrations
someone told me adding a chunk of tape to one part of a fan will make it quieter
so i have agreat question
wanna hear a question
reeeeely
oh
ill be a regular there
can we get a #dumb-questions  channel
says you need access
thats from a private server so it only works if you're in the channel
this link shouldnt work for you
its a direct link to the message so if ur in the server it qorks
yup
nah its a message link, like this 
good job security for them and the police if they did tho
i though you meant they just casually went around commiting arson
ohhh
you mean pyrotechnic, right?
if the vapours catch fire then it 'explodes' in a fireball i think
even im not that dumb
then they put it in their non ventilated house
i think its cause a ransomware attack on some pipeline company iirc
theres a shortage
smh
lmao, saw a photo of someone filling a laundry basket with holes in it with gas
Yeah I did the test after a earlier prototype snapped cleanly in that spot
I did this test retrospectively
Its too late. Its already installed and put together
ive got a downwards one but i do need to add a upwards one, i can get that later, for now i just added some extra plastic
a curved upwards edge or a curved downwards edge
seems all the stress on on my part are focuses in one spot, and that one spot just got reinforced in my redesign- thats pretty good
might need to make one of these for my next psu
Wanna weld some blocks to their rail and complain they dont move any more
A man of culture
I see
nah i would use high quality misumi rails for good quality
imo, it would be hilarious watching my crap welding and some big ass metal frame zooming around
but funny
oh really
brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
go
big metal box
i was gonna weld the entire fram together
heheheh
no stealy
that was my idea
oi
i can always add one after
i dont need them to be flat, its alright if the prints are a little funky
wdym
accuracy is no concern
yup
And a wee bit of CAD advice
Its relatively urgent
<@141593844788494336> . I need help
Or is it the other way round
And the overhangs are so clean
What's cool is that its either 0.05mm too big or 0.05mm to small. So its super accurate
My 2020 extrusion delete. Its got some weird ringing (looks like 'noise' from the lower speeds I used to print it) it has holes for heated inserts to connect to the rail and y axis
ill make my corexy normal and robust tho
for just speed
im gonna buy a tiny delta and make it have larger arms and have it barely large anough for a benchy
no problem
and weirdchamp is like a weird but cool celebration
and pogchamp is similar
so pog is like a celebration thing
like a celebration thing, in video games P.o.G means play of the game
pog
what did you change
nice,
lmao,you gotta get more sleep man
dude are you typing an essay or some shiz, ive made popcorn and gotten my phone and you're still typing
higher speed and temp or same temp and lower speesd
pick your poison situation
too cold temp or high speed
Anything I can do now
I could add a brim but that means reslicing
Ive got rounded edges
Any quick fix other than enclosure
Hm my abs keeps warping
And if I redo the belts ill be greasing my idlers
Ill just be messing around on my x gantry and possibly regreasing the rails with dry silicone or thin oil
Ill be doinh some maintenance on the printer so ill be on vc soon
Oh yeah. Hotend influences that too
But it's Wattage is near 30 to 40
Until ot melts
Infinetly hot
Phew
Very expensive
imagine your job being signing into discord and being ridiculed
imagine the guy who reads those from slice and just gets torn to shreds
oooooh boy
are slice actually on the discord
lmao
f
Cause I check them and everything else regularly
Wdym, as in they'll vibrate loose?
I left the screw a wee bit loose so that I get less noise
<@141593844788494336>. Fpr my fans dummie
Its fine I got slightly longer plastic screws so its safe
But better
Not silent
I just loosed the screws and its quieter
Or just use m6 screws
Nice
Do you wear camo shorts or jeans or just cargo pants with camo
At all
Not petty
Bruh
Maybe
Not you
Guess whos not wearing ugly trousers
Good
Ah goos
But you couls get weird artifacts from the teeth on the bearings
F
Lol 10 4
Properly
Gn
Tell me if anything important happens
Oh hey dutch is live
I got my hand stuck on the bed when a print started and the z lowered on to my hand
I was tired
I once grabbes the hot part of a soldering iron instead of the plastic handle
I get to wear not ugly trousers
I got my hike tomorrow
I got sleep to attend to
Gn
And not allowed a angle grinder
I'm cut free sucker
for nerf wars
SAFETY SQUINT TO THE RESCUE
Psh I'm joking. Usually. So thpse external drivers huh
Or a drill on a printer
My worst machinery is a drill or printer
I don't use heavy machinery so I'm fairly safe
Its fun
Ill rwmember that when I next put my feet through a woodchipper
Just use a engineering stick to poke stuff
Degloved?
My room is awfully dangerous and takes a knowledgeable person to navigate it safely. Which is why I get injured often
I nearly grabbed a heater block to tighten it with my bare hands
For example. Ah me
I cut my hand on a toothbrush once
Servos are great but people of my skill should do a 180 and fucken run
Vez had his carriage whip into his frame when the belt gave out
But in all seriousness its very dangerous unless someone slightly advanced is handling them. Any beginner should stay clear for a bit since they uave a lot of torque
Too late. But I did already know that
They have no holding torque and the way it's simulated can be dangerous of handled incorrectly
DOPE
Be
Would
Thatv
And a solid gold skeeter
Cf polishes extrusion
Copper extrusion
Brass extrusions
oooooooo
CHROME
Did I hear the wors
Also better than my friends printer suggestions
Why nightmare
Dweeb
Take that
So
Also ill be the idiot with the best b enchy here
So, brass panels on the printer, polished brass no less wouls be very snazzy
Oh boy
You wot. I gotta get more steel then. I though it was the other way around
There was construction near my house and they were tossing a few meters away every now and then, so I figured I could take some and but anchors
I was gonna use tensioned steel cable
Ill bet you the bench I did yesterday that it's good
I bet they do a lot
If youre right ill buy some corner brackets and print some 90 degree inside corner brackets
The. Redo them and compare
You know what. Ill undo them and do a adxl test when doing my tuning
ill be taking  a 5010 and slapping a crap duct to it and aiming it at the print
and gfci english equivalent in my sockets
and ive got fuses in every outlet
dont wqorry, i tested everything was grounded when i was making fun of grabbing the psu
the worst part is the psu but everything accesible and though out
Its all sorted I was just making fun of it since ot looks bad
And they'll be tucked away onto the frame channels once the board is mounted
I'm holding all the cables that go to the top of the printer rn
The messiest part is that the extruder has its own wrap until I mount ot better
Anf the z is with its endstop
E erything going to the moving parts is serpareted and bundled with steppers
Everythings wrapped and on seperate levels
Dw it just looks bad
Of wires?
And doing b-Tec hevacs
So I'm deleting the extrusion
Too heavy I cant get my speed bench to work
Time get a duct and fix my y axis
Nice
And then inverted the steppers
Just the cables
And do I need to change anything cfg wise for sensorless homing
It homes in the right spot
And that's it right
All good
Thatsvjust a ! Infront of dir
So I invert both for back right
Theyre homing in front left
Alright
Anything I need to do in cfg
Well I swapped the cables
If your gonna use the externals you gotta go all the way
Not 240v ac
Why just 80
Ill just keep hotswapping
Sounds expensive
Duh
Well they break when I hotswap
So ridiculous
Gotta buy new ones every time I need to swap
Dunno why they make them single use tho
Same with drivers
No no. Just unplug the stepper and plug in a new one
No hotswapping mid print either
But no customizability
Alright ill swap motors
Nope
Guide says swap motors
No y is mirrored but x is fine
So swap the virtual endstop name too
Cheers, I gotta swap my motors, how do I do that in cfg
Eueueueugh slow
If you do it budget then yes
Yes I think it's near the 1k range
Yup
Vzbot with fancy bits and bobs
Hevort
Railcore
K3 or k2 iirc
Is 1.2k expensive when something equally as good exists for less
Cuz ya basic
Mhm, ya just jealous
Ewww I do mine properly. Imagine bitting, cring
Not sure. I think y but gotta check
Like urs?
Welp. Config is easier
Easy dubs
So I just reverse one motor
And I dont have a crimp
My pc is already on
For now ill just mirror the print so it's unmirrored in the print
I do need to un mirror one axis tho
Imma go remove my y axis print a fan duct and prepare the printer for a speedy b enchy on the weekend
Hey crazy guess what
ill try restart
nope its not here, ill let it boot up and try again in a sec
dont get the tft unless its for marlin
alright ill go power down
nope, wont show up
nah no ports nearby
gimme a sec
yup
i could an hour ago tho
i cant even ping it
so uh, anyone had problems with mainsail not connecting recently
to wich part, pi or axis (i got that one figured out-someone linked a guide)
also one of my axis is mirrored, i just gotta find wich one (only on prints otherwise it moves normally i think but idk)
i cant connect to my pi
uh oh
if i can should i use one long bolt to mount the x axis extrusion then 1 shorter one on the side
Hehheheheheheh. I fear for my steppers and linear rails
You can watch me mutilate some cad files too
Ill be on vc in a bit making a 2020 rail delete
So <@173827530929733632>. How wouls you rate my printer (scale of 1 to 10) on electrical safety, print quality and speed
Gn
Cool, just wanted to check
About to start a speed benchy
Wait can I use vc
Ah nvm
Drv8825 do 45 too but no fancy features
Not 80v. The highest voltage ones do 50
Theres a high voltage variant
T minus 4min
Get ready for take off
Overheat and die
The others go poof
Just gotta wait for bed to heat
Alright here goes one more
And 240 top speed
No no 180k accel and 150 corner speed
Speed benchy
It failed stupendously
Missed ir
Watch this <@173827530929733632>
Here we go, adjusted some values and trying again
And accel to decel
So I think i need to reduce corner speed
It was on a lot of small moves
Yikes. It shot off to the side
<@173827530929733632>. Here we go, heating up now
<@!173827530929733632>
alright, nearly out of storage so youll have to watch my stream, ill start it once im sure the print is ok
time to fly, setting the benchy off now, brb
can someone in vc help me with my slicer
about to do a speed boat
alright
If I see any dust ill add greaee
Cool
Right
But threads are good. Lots of torque provided on threads and torque os good
Sounds good to me
No clue
Dunno if that was as extensively tested
On v0
<@173827530929733632>. My idlers are sounding....crunchy. Did you ever try adding grease to the bolt for slightly smoother rotation
Its what imma use later
Nah I saw it on voron and thought it was cool
Lol
Dunno why you would want magnets and dowels and steppers and leadscrews for a spool holder
Makes much more sense noe
Oh I seee
Just smooth ptfe rubes
Its instead of bearings
Ill send you the stl its a actual thing
Oi
I saw one like that with ptfe tubes
Is that for a spool holder
For only 5 bucks too
Oh nooo, ill keep them for you, out of the kindness of my heart
Check out the <#818597194856792065>. To see some completed builds. I recently did mine but I built the prior version, hence the 1 .0.1 on my name instead of 2.0.1 <@407924515797073921> , you can request one of the mods to change your nickname (I'm sure they'll understand)
Lol. All good then. Weve had 3 or 5 e5 plus builds and we have a full instruction set and. Stl release but no CAD or official BOM yet
Hello <@407924515797073921> interesting name choice
<@!451709396280410132>  i drew a grid and i think ive got it
oh wait, duh
like this?
oh wait i just do the inverse so instead of 250/300 it would be 50/300
cheers, this diagonal move should just use 1 motor right, if so how do i use the other motor
cheers
that 60 is the repetitions right
is there any way too loop this
G1 X30 Y30
G1 X250 Y250
G1 X30 Y30
this should do a diagonal move right
For calculating max speed
We should put this in there
At low speed you can determine your max acceleration, then you increase velocity until you get a skip. That's your pullout torque point(and maximum velocity)
Our FAQ is looking kinda bare
Anway gtg
And keep hold current at run current until after tuning
Unless its a large value
No homing retract, no good for tuning
Gotta use a lower value and speed
Did you tune with these values
I have a spread od 20 values
Mines pretty good, try lower current on homing and half the rotation distance for speed
Ik it's still off by quite a bit, thats just the best I could slice
First print, all sides measure 20.05 and no tuning
yup. 6 30 am wake up
Also dang it. All the cool live streams happen when I gotta be sleeping
Yikes. Thats like sayimg if I get barbecued cause bad instruction. Sucks to be me
Cool
I see
<@173827530929733632>. Whats a people watcher (the role)
<@!451709396280410132>  whats people watcher mean
because they heard about you betraying your beloved superior corexy
are you hanging yourself for betraying voron
no he would never betray voron
hes a bit of a supremasist about it
oh he practically loves voron
'WANNA SEE MY TINY PP' i just built it
VORON= GOODERER THAN ANY PRINTER
but VORON=BEST LITTLE POGCHAMP
belt tension holds up everything
to be fast, this is a speed competition
but very fast
holy shit
and dimensionally accurate
but prints are all good
oh also <@!141593844788494336>  the printers already tuned well, ive just gotta do PA and input shaper
ive already got a benchy done, 40m
anonymity, ill use a mic later
gotta turn off my mic
ill do it step by step, my way
just have some patience
just you wait
yeah but mines within my printers limit without a toolhead so i just gotta lose some weight and get the speed together and then it will work#
ik but all values are attainable, i just gotta get the printer working
ah, lighten the x axis so the y axis moves less weight
so i need to lighten the load for my stock steppers
yes. that rail weighs 400g
Ill probably spend tonight doing that then print it during school then fix the y
No can do. Got school work then sleep to attend to. I do need to make a adapter to lighten the y tho
Its within my extrusion speed and the printer should be able to do it but I havent tested yet
Oh I dunno if I can actually print that
Also <@173827530929733632>. Your right adding the head made quite a difference
Well I've got my sliced benchy down to 9min. Now I need to reduce the y axis weight (replace the extrusion) and try a print. Ive just got to get 80k accel and 260mm/s
And the red following the walls
Bottom left corner
dang still got the weird solid shiz but now the infill covers the walls
its off, does ur config do this
those solid layers
any clue how to get rid of this in superslicer
ill tune speed soon
just wanna get this print done
yup
they all look identical
heres my setting
swicthing to superslicer
cura
any clue why every part but my walls are full speed
lol
Also can someone share their slicer set up
Acc
Also just started a print with 200mm/s top speed and 100k acv
<@141593844788494336>. The worlds fastest bench is now held by a voron 2.4
Lmao <@206880729509003265>. Everyone waited for your serial request beforw posting theirs
my psu is a landy ones so i dont wanna fry it
ah, ill stick to my voltages then
i just dunno if the gains are woth it
my baord is good, my pi will be fine, my heaters will probably be good and the steppers are allowed to do a max of 30v and drivers 29v
ill be right on the upper limits so maybe 27.5
is it worth turning up the voltage on my psu to go from 23.8v to 28v
Plus all my friends are here
Yup
Nah ita meant to be science specialist (but the teachers manage to mix up melanin and melatonin)
Lol my school is the blandest mix of generic bland people
Ah 'backchat'gets you after school here
Breaking dress code does mean you can get suspension
Yikes. If I walked into school looking anything like that I would get turned around and set home for the week
Lmao. Did you pass
Lucky, you got to wear your own clothes. I gotta wear some itchy ass clothes that barely fit and are sold out in every single store so I'm stuck wearing oversized shit
And if you don't wear some flimsy ass shitty lanyard then its all lunch time
If ypu just wear PE kit when your not meant to its a lunch time detention
If you wear the wrong uniform its a 2 hour after school or sent home
But I have some hike thing at school so I gotta wear these shoes
I have to wear a blazer a white buttoned shirt a belt and formal shoes
Mmm stylish. School trousers and hiking boots
Also
Hes not og and soesnt own a printer
Gn
Also
You are very valued
I take it back, you can be our little pogchamp
No no no
Cuz he's not got a colour
Salty boi gonna be salty
I see
Hey kyle how comes your name is red
Get in. Ill be the only v0 soon
But 1.0.1 sounds cooler so take that <@126409155299770368>
Noooooooo
I am the only person on v0 that's pretty fuckin dope
Aaaaaaaaah. I am number one. Get in. That is a great number and thanks for holding out on that policy until after my build
I chose it because its meant to be hot swappable and I need easy acces to the hotend
Yep its the v2.2 toolhead
Hes a real chonker
Ik
<@141593844788494336>. It is a afterburner
i see
what did you change
ya drunk
go home klipper
How do I enable a fan whenever my drivers are active
I love manual bed leveling on small beds
Such a smooth first layer
Although slightly pinkish
Purple unfortanelty
Pog?
Tada new build plate
Just fold some tinfoil over itself and cut a hole
Stock or not
Qq how fast does your bed heat to 90 degrees
sorry sorry
dont tire youself out, your mid afternoon nap isnt for another hour
cyanora
ive done it on some items stuck in transit
that gets you a refund by defualt if no agreement is reached
open a dispute
is it on ali
dinosuars and whatnot
nah im to young for barney ya know, too violent
uhm im too old for sesame street, get with it gramps, hey arnold is all the rage nowadays
nono, you are the BOOOOMER
mhm, thats what boomers say
i do it because my gcse wont need me to write it, only translate it and know a bit about the roman empire
et Latinam, et non sit crassa
and no one particularly cares
eh we dont stick to that
Oh okay thats easy to fix. I just swap the headers for the x and y in cfg
I think
Ok so my prints wont face the right direction but will be the right part
I can home on any direction so whichever is least effort and gets me a not mirrored print is good
Its should be fine like this right
And it thinks thats max
<@178418959853289472>. Invertee both and now it homes in the back left in stead of back right
nice, looks good but the price isnt justifiable
but no ones gonna complain if they got one
is thst duet
thanks
yes
yup
just swapped the headings and nada, ill try the second thing next tho
so wichever homed in the wrong direction was set to home at min/max instead of max/min
same issue, dunno how to fix it either
uh oh
mine was 8 usd with ferrules
you kidding me
540 usd
ewww
ah cool
nice, all the images just show cross sections of perfect squares, good to see mines working rightr
about the ferrules
oh it was m
nah wrong person i think
My x axis homes correctly but the y goes in the wrong direction
It goes in the wrong direction
My sensorlews homing isnt working
I need help
i set mine to 250 since thats my travel distance although the bed is  240
just how wide it is and how deep it is
and do i enable jerk and acceleration control
what do i put here
um
lol, ive been building for half a year
november 8, sunday 2020
and my build will finish this weekend
<@!173827530929733632>   my first ever message
i am active in EVERY SINGLE SERVER mwa hahahahahh
oh really
<#747900926324375572>  please
check your rank my friend
hey, a man can dream that gantry weight is holding him down
oh yeah, ok. i thought they were super stiff
in water and a kn95 mask
get good glue/sheets
why not a sheet like this cut to fit the extrusion with holes in
yupper
you csn see exactly when i plugged in the thermistor
why not replace it with a cut to size strip of cf
i changed it to the defualt
there it is, thermistor must be in backwards
lemme check
it worked for a sec then did the same thing. lemme check logs
ah i see, does it mention wich one. i assume hotend
lemme see
alright
also i gtg so wont be ablew to respond
pleas ehlp
keep getting this on startup
is superfly lighter than sherpa
yeah and i want a million dolars
gpu
and my current pc is a 3rd gen 17 from intel with 4gb ram so i need a pc upgrade
i like modding and need a workstation plus i need something with a long lifespan
5th gen ryzen 7
wdym intel
im waiting to buy a 3080 or a 4080 and a 5th gen r7 and 64gb of ram with 1tb fast ssd and 4tb hdd
im still waiting for parts to be available
cooler then
oh nevermind then
prebuilt pc
Their blade design isnt even that good for cooling. Tbf theyre meant for silence not performance
cheers, right on time too
and will i need to change the usb name after
ah, makes sense, wheres the firmware file
ill try
skr pro v1,2
tried flashing my new board and got this error, please help
Failed to flash to /dev/serial/by-id/usb-STMicroelectronics_BLACK_F407VE_CDC_in_FS_Mode_326236633539-if00: Error running dfu-util

If the device is already in bootloader mode it can be flashed with the
following command:
  make flash FLASH_DEVICE=0483:df11
  OR
  make flash FLASH_DEVICE=1209:beba

If attempting to flash via 3.3V serial, then use:
  make serialflash FLASH_DEVICE=/dev/serial/by-id/usb-STMicroelectronics_BLACK_F407VE_CDC_in_FS_Mode_326236633539-if00

make: *** [src/stm32/Makefile:69: flash] Error 255
thanks
ah good, thanks for the help. do you mind sending me your config so i can use it as a starting point for my new board
skr pro v1.2
nothing else
the manual just says sub 180W
i just need to make sure my board can power it without catching fire
ive got a multimeter
how would i check this
You can make it look better I just had pvc laying around and needed to use it
Short tube but less weight
Use a Bowden like mine
also looks like teaching tech is making a guid for klipper and high speed printing, pretty nice
100% a scummy price but is that a spray painted fan
i think vez has got one of those
dang, i only gained weight but lost some fat and got a little definition
i just eat gum, constantly, better than snacking and fresh breath is nice
surprisingly the melzi boards have nuts of steel, mine got a little droopy and has been powered on with the voltage the wrong way round twice and it still turns on, but i binned it for safety's sake
Daaaamn 1.6k subs (ps for shorter vids put #shorts to get the video show up for more people)
No problem. Glad to help l, that build is looking pretty sweet
ah good
f
did it shrink or crack
cant yank it off, just shoved it in the door and pulled, so its good
i just thought they were meant to be flat, just wanted to make sure i was doing it right too
true, but this was the cheapest option second hand or not
if they go flat wont they get too wide for a screw terminal
i see
mines square, but why flat
wich one
lol
yup
Dunno if that's right
Heres a high contrast image, the teeth stick out with small detents
Looks kinda funky
Here's a ferule on a usb power wire
The teeth are a little gappy and aren't tightly packed (I think) so it looks kinda funky but overall its worth it
It looks good for 10 bucks
My ferule kit arrived
Wich imo is its only redeeming quality
But voron style corexy fixed that
True
But if you use bearings instead of idlers you can buy from any seller as long as belts and pulleysvare good
f
whats everyone up to
good, sins like this deserve public humiliation
oh okay HIPS is hard to print
bleugh
i think im gonnna be sick
oh my god
ah nah i need the ferules too
The multimeter?
Now I need a crimper and I can build
Me multimeter is here
Wayyyy
Nice
got my booster 4 or so years ago
oh im good then
how long does a tetanus shot last
Which is why I buy 2gt gates belts and dont worry about the speccing of the other parts
but theres no images of me online so its good
oh i did that with my yt
no worries, you are doing merc im doing v0
Aformentioned drawer
Woo
Imma get me serial
Cause my board is 2 weeks early
This guy
But you know who isnt small or sad
My drawer is small and sad
Lucky fucker
What z mod have you done?
nice
F
whats everyone up to
Any way, bye
But on a standard set up the bed is attached to the bed in all directions. Which is frankly stupid just make sure it cant rotate or move up and down and just let it slide in x and y
Just decouple the nuts x and y movement from its x movement
Is that easy to do
Ah
Is this to fix z wobble (also I'm finally getting ferules and a multi meter)
gn, got school tomorrow
separate motor power input
yeah the government and civil disrest and dying economy and overworked labourers and lack of sustainable infrastructures kinda iffy ya know, especially when most of the good america stuff can be found in european countries
its nice, but you arent missing out on much
ah, ive only been to US ones, mostly ilta-con
which ones
my tshirt collection is mostly cybersecuirity conference shirts or plain coloured tshits
my entire wardrobe can be explained with one word, plain so i should be fine
ah, my schools fairly calm, most recent fight was a month ago and some 14 year old kicked the shit out of some 17 year old
yeah i dont see myself getting into many fights
easy peasy
uh oh, 'feel' and 'parts of my body' shouldnt go in a sentence together
oh crap, how do i avoid everything mentioned above
he took down 5 drug cartels with one end mill
tee hee
Well idk if its actually bad they just click A little
I have started going to the gym and swimming thi
Ah, no
Oh god. Hes lied. Everyone maze os a lier. Hes not a gopher
Oh Christ. I'm 14 and o swear my joints cry every time I stand up
Nop
Yup
It just has to hold the extruder high enough up that it can reach the hotend with a short bowden
Extruder mount all done, all thats left is to heatshrink wrap it for rigidity and install a new board
instead of idlers at the front, you use motors
should i OC the proccesor fot faster pulses
<@!451709396280410132>  speed
wait why doesnt nitram use 1x microstepping then
nah i could run my steppers at the same speed with 2x microsteps and 32
nah, i just want speed
you wot, im replacing all my steppers with those then
Yes
oh yeah, well worth the new motors
yep just remember to use rms current and not input there max current
[9:32 PM]
Quick explanation of current setting on TMC drivers. the value you put in should be the RMS value. not peak value that is written on the stepper.
The calculation of RMS from peak current is this:
Motor_Peak_Current x 0.707

Since we don't want to push the motors with 100% we'll do:
Motor_Peak_Current x 0.707 x 0.80

That will give us a 20% safety margin.
On a stock Ender 3 motor that is 0.84A peak 
0.84x0.707x0.8 = 0.47A

So you input 0.47 in run_current of your TMC stepper. 

A normal 1.4A stepper is:
1.4x0.707x0.8 = 0.79A

so you put 0.79 in run_current of your tmc stepper. 

the Hold current there is no "rule" about. i like to do Run_Current - 0.2
This will depend on the use case.
drop it to 650ma
yeesh, mines at 800ma with active cooling and get warm
just check ur using rms current and not the max current in your config
if so at what speed and how many amps
well are the stock ones overheating
torque looks fine, but do you want speed
<@!206880729509003265>  if you dont mind purple and green i can get some to you soon, wya
the wantai or e3d high torque
lpt: click the return to international site button in the top bar on ali to return english
what channel
you can set accel higher for x and lower for y
And if on klipper theres a config change you could make to have limits for accel on y and x that are independent of each ither
Make sure the pulleys are acrually tightened
klipper?
still cartesian tho right
on what printer
No clue what that is
Ah
Wich adds pressure and velocity
Add a small inlet around the fastest air part and it will pull in more air behind it
So this is a typical Venturi effect
Lemme find a diagram or draw one
Ill show you where it goes once I mount it
Extruder mount
Thank god its not going on the toolhead
Weighs in at 800g
Extruder mount
Some engines
Nerf guns use it
Anything really
If he means Venturi it means constricting the airs path and adding a vent the increaeed speed pulls in air and gives more pressure
Venturi effect
ah nvm then, ill stick with my setup
i could have cooled every part of my printer, how many thermistors
oh man
oh well, i dont really need this stuff
wish i waited for this instead of getting the pro
daaaaaaaaaaaaamn
6 pwm
whats it called
its got a ethernet port on it too
uh duh, i missed that
what are all thos epower inputs for
thats a chonker
holy shit
whose using dd and whos using bowden
ah, just slice them in half with a knife
f
you can always open a dispute
Cool. Just got a nice area to make a workshop. I plan on full surroumd sound and plenty of organisers and. Drop down lighting and other stuff
Cool. And drill presses and mills amd lathes and those sort of things
Ah cool,machinery and all that?
Bruh. Skin cancer much
Also wherw do you guys get your work benches and machinery and vices and clamps
Any ways. I gtg its 1am and I need sleep
Ah there it is, just zip tie it together
I gotta get a work bench with tslot, also I cant see the weld, where is it
Yikes
Ahem. No spares
Also can I allow the z nut to move freely in x and y whithout it rotating and allowing it to move up and down
Appreciate the pffer Man
Yup. Out of budget
Yea
Far easier to just modify what I have with parts ive already got
Uk
Weights and re used vslot wheels are much cheaper
True but I can't afford it
Stock e5
And it won't wobble
Since the weight is off the motor
If I add stabilisers and use a weight I would technically have a more stable bed
Would I benefit from a counter weighted z
That's quite a bit 4 times more than my multimeter
But only because I coulsnt afford something that wasnt archaic and not hot garbage
Hey. I got groovemount
Vooce channel
Hey Dutch dude I think <@823325160558952488>. Is actually deceased. Hes been in a vc for 2 days
It's why I'm gonna have to end up designing my own carriage or making a v6 to mgn12h mount and a 40mm fan duct for the heatsink
you can hear it when you hold a rubber band to your ear, increase the amount and the tone gets lower, degrease and it getts higher (as long as the distance bewteen 2 hands are the same)
think of tension as stress of a length, decrease stress=less tension increase length=less tension
yup
annex is just pure engineering, its great
good luck
lmao
much better
lol
ive been racking my brain for the last week trying to figure it out
i thought it was normal
yes but those 2 back ones are at the front
ah
they all face with the non toothed part outwards
hm, my vo doesnt have that
hey crazy, i dont see where the extra pulleys are in a voron style belt path versus a stock version
for a really short bowden tube
and waiting for my parts to print for a extruder bracket
relaxing
wink wink
should it be lower
run current 0.8 hold current 0.5
156 for 55mm/s homing
yeah b and q is only good for housing diy stuff or something without specific sizing
i bought all mine off ali since my local hardware store is about as useful as a paper bag
how, i did mine with a dinky wood saw on my lap wile watching youtube and only amputated 3 legs...just kidding i didnt cut myself
f
i used a butter knife and reshaped and sharepened it
f
hey same, ive got a whole knife sharpening set
my cheapo knife cant so its clearly not hardened
it should be hard enough to scratch glass if its actually hrc 58 iirc
ill figure it out
or it runs on dc battery not sure wich
it runs on 220v so i would need a ssr tho
oh so i could use it for berd air or hevacs
i know but if this is gonna be a integral part i dont want it coming anywhere near to failing
180l/min vs 15l/m
i was gonna use it for berd air
50 bucks
can a a air compressor be run indefinetly
Thank you
Any clue how to know the polarity of a capacitor
Nah I'm waiting til I can buy a nema14
They look funky
Yeah but it's cool
Cuz I cut one open
Wanna see whats inside a screw terminal
Lol
any highspeed corexy
do i need threadlocker or should i be fine wthout
lol
the air speeds up wich is good, you could also try a venturi effect with an inlet for performance but it looks good
how come it only goes through one pipe, is it meant to do that
well done
I mean use it to support the overhang and gain some performance
And you dont need to see the explanation just see it in work
Its roughly 19m in
Just skip forward to the vanes part
Lemme go get a video showing it
Better air flow
Just make sure its printable
As long as you do it right theres a lot to be gained
Nice
Even half assed mediocre vanes are far better than none
Like a grid inside there
Add vanes for better cooling and support for the overhang
Well if you do it right in the slicer it looks like one overhang is very short and rests on other layers and the other is a gradual slope
Well I didnt like their extruder since ot got lots of complait of uneven extrusion so I'm either gonna use cantilever rails on top of the printer to let the extruder move freely and have a not quite direct drive or stick to Bowden until I get a sherpa
Yours has a extruder and cooling
So yours is slimmer but longer but mines only using a hotend and heatsink fan
Wait lemme check. I think ive got something wrong. Yours is 98x61 mine is 79x62
I may actually ask him. If he gets cost down and keeps quality its a win win
Oh crap, more compact than my afterburner and has tons more stuff on it <@141593844788494336>
Massive improvement
Damn
I wonder if its worth messaging trianglelabs or mellow or fysetc about making a nova hotend or magnum+ (if its good)
gn
or juul
you mean a vape
i mean a speedboat entry
ive been building since the beginning of lockdown
you can submit your entry since mine is technically a different printer
new board arries in 18 days and i should be ready in 21
the second my printer is ready ill be submitting a vid
big part
just make one shorter and have it sit flush with the top of the plastic
no screws?
cmon, its worth it
<@!173827530929733632>  we gotta get ange his number 9 serial
hello
i think i count as advanced but only for this printer, do i still count
you can never release files from a pirated version
oh yep
huh?
no
please
oh god
nah its a official downlaod but with some weird activation key
caugh, pirate
<@!173827530929733632>
In all seriousness tho it would make finding answers to questions easy. You search your question in the aode bar and look for a pink username <@173827530929733632>. (Also my serial bot may be very delayed, but check out ticket bot. Vzbot uses it)
We gotta get hot pink helper roles
Annex is like the rolling phone prototype. Very high end constantly in development and very cool and has tons of engineering behind it. Except its very costly
Nice
Or helper role
Also I just want a pretty colour
Imo voron is the apple of diy corexy as is duet the apple of boards, and vzbot is the gaming phone of printers
Cheers also I fixed the belt
<@141593844788494336>. Any recommendation of a easy to mount lightweight v6 hotend without fanducts
Nah the pulley is Just a bit low, ill fix it later
Also after installong the afterburner ive lost 9.5mm of travel
No clue
Someone @'ed me asking about pulled pork
LMAO I got @ in the voron server asking about pulled pig
bi-metallic heatbreak
then they do a cross section of 2 nozzles and compare sound made from a wire bristle and conclude the e3d nozzle is smoother and has less machining marks than the nova
and he keeps insisting theres too much demand and that he cant possibly upload evidence
and the devs arent even unfair, they crdit him for his thinner heatbreak wich means less conductivity backwards then they point out its easier to snap
says its all about simulations and calculations hes done]
then he takes a shit on the mosquito style heatbreak
while some devs try ask him one question and he just avoids it entirely while talking about his 'impossible tolerances'
and saying hes being attacked
vlad just keeps promising proof and videos explaining his 'engineering'
and they show how the m4 threads are only good if your nozzle/ block is less thermally conductive than your block/nozzle
and he sells spider couples as if theyre some brand new tech
well e3ds nozzles turn out to be better machined
its not just him complaining, its his entire hotend getting torn to shreds
in the speedboat discussion
take a peruse through the dsicord
oh yep
do you dislike the nova hotend/vlad
theyre talking about comparing slice nozzles too
did you see that comparison of the nova nozzle and volcano nozzle on the annex server
oh good
what did you ghet
oh thank god
why are you getting a v6
get something better man
nooo, not a v6
welp, stock bmg for now i guess
ah true
<@!141593844788494336>  uh oh, they dont have a nema17 version do they
ill be building it this weekend then
dope
is that second pin for the second gears pivot
i think it does then
i dont think it does
ah poop
time to get pritning then, does it need good cooling
nice
Does it need anything not stock in a bmg and what Bowden tubw connectoe does it use
Oh well, is it worth fixing or should I just build a sherpa
The pokemon thing is too large and hole too small, the extruder gear that isnt turned by a stepper doesnt fit either
It doesnt fit
<@141593844788494336>
true, but this looks cooler imo
<@!141593844788494336>  print didnt go too well so its reprinting now
ah ok, so no matter what i do it should work, i seem to have a current tension of 60hz
awwwwwwwwwwwww
with supports
ah nah, just got up and started the print
but it looks good
another 40m
<@451709396280410132>. How do I use that tensioner app, ive installed it but what do I click
Is it the mercury with vslot or is it e5 corexy with vslot
<@141593844788494336>. 1hr 30m eta until I start assembling your extruder
Why not have the main extruder frame embedded into the eva carriage
Ah I was close
Ivw got another 8 hours til I'm meant to wake up. Amd I get a 3 day weekend
Unfortunate
America?
will do
Lol 12 for me
i love resins ability to be mixed and customised on the fly
im gonna print them all at once and just try a bearing once its a few layers in
welp, it should print in a hour so it should be nice and easy
cool, saves 40m in that orientation too
Smooth layer stacking too
also, any clue how to lay the main body on the plate
wanna see some new filament i got
lmao
i see, so do you think its worth getting some nicer gears off my other printer for this one or should i just leave it with the mediocre ones
ah, cool
this one isnt necessary is it
now to make myself a mount for afterburner
should look nice in matte black
dope, ill get to printing it tmrw
it looks really good
nice
i got mine at trianglelabs quality for ¬£7
nop
true but the frame can be directly adapted to vzbot but either way 10 bucks is cheaper than the parts separately
true, although i got mine for 100 from a bid like this
pretty good deal
thank you
i prefer 17 for now, but if you just finish it then fork off into the slotted version and send me the nema17 version, that is if you want to, idm
ehhhh
and it still firmly attaches to a nema17
i dont understand, whats better about the slot
<@!141593844788494336>
you mean have slotted holes that still attatch to a nema17
nice
f
so m3
its 2.97mm
lemme go get it
yup
yeh
if so send me the files after please
m3 i think, also is that the extruder i showed you
ah nice, for once its justified spending more
welp, fany ones it is then
why not the cheapest aliexpress motor
i plan on getting a nema 14 soon and using my pancake for z
not yet
this looks like a pretty good bmg conversion with some simple mounting points
Welp I may use link or gitd
I may swap to a gold and red setup but my v2 should be purple and matte black
Just clear petg and a really nice red
Mine is just a printer made to print a few abs parts so nothing fancy
Oh nice
<@173827530929733632>. Do we have a role for v0 owners, I should get a serial on the 21st since my board arrives on the 19th and everything else is ready
all thats left for a v0 serial is my board
hey my adx just arrived with my extruder and nozzle
If you want a half wide just use a 2010 extrusion
That's just drilling holes right
so, human interaction, huh
travels to japan and trains
hes a ninja
I KNEW IT
f
the top one will sit closer to 260-300 and the bottom one closer to 190-225
it will have 2 40w heaters and individually controlled heat zones
but yeah its like nitrams block except jankier
cheap injection molding too
gotta save money
well, fastest benchy?
so i remove the tip of a volcano nozzle and screw it in to the 2 blocks to connect them and use the threads of another to create a dual stacked block then you attach the nozzle
well i dont wanna spend any money that isnt neccesary so a coldish dual volcano seems like the cheapest way to get hf
just a square 20x20mm carbon fiber tube
i think i hit that on one or two moves but im hoping to get 40v steppers and raise the pwm scale for faster movements
and a double stack volcano for fast prints
and ill be using dry ptfe grease on every axis a[art from z and relubing my bearings so that the entire thing has the least reistance possible
the second my v1 works ive got some matte black pla and purple abs for a v2 with idlers
lol
dont listen to that crazy man, you're worthy, you'll see non planar printing some day
dont worry ender 5 i still love you
no no, the newest odrive should have a really good basline autotune
v4 odrive has autotune
hey there buddy, when was the last time you've seen daylight
like my double stack volcano im building
just diy it
lol
hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
software engineer? and adult only is 18+ right
us only? and for what age
ah nice, nothing im even slightly qualified for
what for?
hes also a engineer, beta tester and hiring engineers
what a steal wow, We sHoUlD Be gRaTeFuL
the arm is cool tho
fair enough
<@!141593844788494336>  good science youtuber, just science, obviously- 
not if you put springs to hold the bed down, tall bolts with springs under the head to hold the bed down, its still rigid but allows for flex
it will force it to warp
on foam
3 points
no
im building my own hotend using 2 stacked volcanos for a output equivalent of a supervolcano becuase i cant aford a super colcano
55 extrusions
mgn2
i beleive you mean 15 v6's combined into one 3mm nozzle
v0 is good, up to v2 everything was fine, then  you get discord flairs like 'questionable advice'
but voron 2.4, thanks chump change
since ya know, merc is way too expensive
now we should just build a voron
yeah ik our comminuty is elitist huh. we should strive to be more like the voron dicord
so ducthdude can rename the entire project to voron v3 and pin the voron subreddit
nice to see them coming together and working to get through the toxicity
before*
after
that i have shared with you
this is relatable and wholesome big funnies
no no
<@!141593844788494336>  so relatable hahahahaha
my leadscrew is super straight so no wobble and if it does wobble im just gonna build a coupler that allows x y movement but no rotation
one leadscrew plus vslot wheels for stability
go for something designed for ht or something fancier
maximum 50 to be safe
And proprietary nozzles
And refuses to provide proof of a lot of things
Yeah he called someone autistic and get banned from r/3dprinting
Someones a bit cranky
well its still corexz and a moving y axis
right
thats still a switchwire
then you get even higher print speeds with its higher volumetric flow
you'll get equal quality at high speeds assuming you do this right
well, it depends, im pushing speeds with top acelerations of 125k and speeds of 325mm/s and my prints are the prettiest, but dutchdude for example has down right gorgeous prints since he has high speeds but nothing crazy, 40k and 400mm/s max i think but im not sure
its not that bad, as long as its well layed out anyone can do any math
Quick explanation of current setting on TMC drivers. the value you put in should be the RMS value. not peak value that is written on the stepper.
The calculation of RMS from peak current is this:
Motor_Peak_Current x 0.707

Since we don't want to push the motors with 100% we'll do:
Motor_Peak_Current x 0.707 x 0.80

That will give us a 20% safety margin.
On a stock Ender 3 motor that is 0.84A peak 
0.84x0.707x0.8 = 0.47A

So you input 0.47 in run_current of your TMC stepper. 

A normal 1.4A stepper is:
1.4x0.707x0.8 = 0.79A

so you put 0.79 in run_current of your tmc stepper. 

the Hold current there is no "rule" about. i like to do Run_Current - 0.2
This will depend on the use case.
yep just remember to use rms current and not input there max current
2gt has less deep teeth profiles
4m total (just over ) but get excess for making mistakes with
no, gt2, 2gt belts work on gt2 parts but gt2 belts dont work on 2gt parts
<@835225916941664286>
what exactly would you like to know
we have a github and a reddit post, also a active community to answer your questions
hello
In having burgers
Unfortanute
Got guests over and looking for cheap ferrule kits
Chocolate is great too. The automatic stomach emptying is great too
why not a tablet or kindle
try a drill and dremel to cut them
youll have to cut them or wait
yeah no
if it just needs to be held together and the plastic is threaded then its fine, if the plastic isnt threaded then it wont work
depending on what youre scrwwing together you may not need to screw them in fully
yep
nice, tell me if theyre anygood
and has anyone tried ceramic bearings
has anyone tried usongshine rails and robotdigg rails- wich is better
skr pro it is then
congratulations on the build
eddietheengineer
ner3dp
also was it you getting the usongshine rails?
so other than steppers are there any good or bad things about either
well theyd be short bursts of loud but when theyre on i dont mind them, the pitch doesnt make it through my door and the printer sits in my bedroom
also robotdigg vs usongshine, do you know if either is better
occasional movements wouldn't be loud
hey for a z axis it wouldnt be terrible of 32x microsteps
motor drivers dont matter for me, ive got a seciond board with some a4988s for any z axis
nah gotta get this soon, killed my board and need a replacement, does the spider have more ports?
also skr pro vs fysetc spider?
oh welp, never mind, just saw they were on sale for ¬£1
for now the stock ones, i wanna do the hoghest voltage possible on them and amp with active cooling, or just higher voltage
thank you
oh good, so its possible
<@!451709396280410132>
and would you reccomend skr pro over the spider
can the spider do that
would one of these be good for driving my steppers at 40v
Only wiring change was my lcd cable, the lcd looks fine tho
My wiring is in the right direction and polarity
I got everything right so I dunno how
My board went pop
Oh fuck
damn, saw two glass panels for a door in a skip  (each bigger than my printer) and i asked if i could take them but the owner didnt know if they were needed or not
like the btt tft24, also check out 
I went for this mod since hevort was out of my budget and vzbot didnt exist
I would do a vzbot or cheap hevort 100%
A low center pf gravity with a cool look and auto gantry leveling plus its easier to install electronics
Why not
And my parts usually get mangled by me and my drill after so I dont care of holes are the wrong size or if it needs some manual correction
And its all held up fine. Even the calipers
And 12 quid filament
1000 zip ties - 4 quid
Calipers - 6 quid
Dremel knockoff - 10 quid
Cheap
I drop mine all the time and theyre great. Aldi sells somw great tools for really chea0
Ive already got digital calipers and they arent that bad
Most cases are comparisons and contrasts
Measurements dont need to be accurate of theyre repeatable
And dial guages are far better for cylindrical items or moving items
Tire gauges are like dial guages but caliper read out
But stuff costs money. And thats something I don't have a lot of, although I may be getting some more funding if I get a scholarship
Lol. I gotta get one of those and a dial guage or tire tread guage
Ill go find one and test in the morning. If not ill get dissecting
I see, so what tells me wich side it positive or negative
Ohhhh
Wait
But I cut it off
A normal usb a male connector
Best I can think of would be a phone but it cant do power delivery
What supplies power through mini usb
The two wires solder into a buck converter and the end goes into my pi
Nah this is for power delivery to the pi
Any way to make sure its got thicc power cables or is it luck of the draw
But wheres the current coming from
I dont see where any power comes from to burn a led
Ah you mean plug into the pi, and .measure from there
No multi meter, but what would I plug it in to
From a mini usb cable for powering my ras pi from a step down converter
Guess ill go disect another wire then
Bruh
For a raspi
The green and whitw wires
Which is positive and wich is negative
lower flow or more cooling
oh nice, mines not too far off, just wanted to check how much travel was gained on using the mercury
No no. But its the same size axis. What size is it. Just to conpare my travel size to what you have
<@173827530929733632>. Whats your x and y length you've set in klipper for the mercury
london?
no problem
<@!206880729509003265>
ask dutchdude for it, i dont think its on the git
Try cleaning in soapy water and really scrub well until its 'squeaky' clean. Also try a very light spray of hair spray, just enough to get a thin glazing
<@625517609076523009>. <@244874310592757771>. Is using a 5+ I think and is part way through his build
that or suspended in a tub
for my rail i left everything in overnight qand let it evaporate fully (the rails werent touching the bottom of the tub) even the plastic
wd40 degreaser probably leaves behind a thin oil but acetone is safest for plastic and the fact that that degreaser may need to be cleaned off is a pain, acetone evaporates same as gasoline
how?
yes but not foaming or ipa
dry ptfe or a safer white lithium grease
acetone works in minutes
it mostly relocaates grease or makes it a thin film
not ipa
no need for drying or cleaning
just use acetone
OwO
sorry, thought the command i was using was disabled in the <#747900926324375572> channel
dry ptfe for speed
and a heatpad and heatsink to passively cool it on the top of the fet
alright ill be using negative pressure from my hevacs to cool it if it heats up too much
if so do i use the bottom of the board with the pads or onto the mosfet directly
should i cool my mosfets on skr v1.4
lol
i need this
WAT
wait
Lol my only stock e5 parts are the bed and z axis, the frame is kinda stock
Whatcha gonnw build
Its far cheaper
You can always build the frame from scratch
But dont intentionally break stuff. Just run a dry print and get some time in
Gotta wait for it to leave beta, that means pushing your printer til it breaks and telling a dev to get it fixed. Once things stop breaking then it should leave alpha
Looking good
lmao
i 100% understand
big brain time
well done
you rebuilt it?
yeah that or white noise apparently helps
they have a feature called self disposal, if lacking in the brain department they self destruct
yeah have you tried having lots of small children, no quiet times
my dads got that, its the worst
i saw a nice air compressor for a bouncy castle i was gonna use on a hevacs / print cooler
i wish i had the balls to go dumpster diving
oh nooo, oh christ
worst ive done elctronics wise was short my hotend heater twice and have a step down converter explode and split a mosfet in half
f
his first fan was thoroughly melted
at least im not like a friend who tried runing 48 5v fans off of 240v ac becuase 240v/48=5
no
please
oh god
oh yeah they supported my entire printer build
ratchet plastic ties?
accidently running all the steppers are 2A and blaming it on the board and decided i needed this upgrade since the printer was clearly broken
and i wondered why it smelt of burnt plastic and had wobbly prints
12 zip ties to connect a zip tie around the groove mount of a v6 to a set of v slot wheels
wanna hear about my old printer
they slot in
nah the in channel kind
dissasembling a 3d printer to add brackets because these were 5 quid cheaper
how about a ¬£3 volcano upgrade
fractured ball bearings in the linear rail
oh yeah 5mm play thats normal right
snap, crackle, pop?
wich its not, since when i got it they made a cronch noise when they moved
alright so the extra expense isnt worth it unless everythimng else is of quality
ah ok, welp if i need to replace bearings for something more to spec would it be unwise to use ceramic
no but less friction means i can worry less about constantly re greasing with dry grease  and the added silence is nice
yeah impregnated is crap, but ceramic is good?
hey im proficient in tinkercad and duct tape and on field modifications with a drill and scissors
ceramic like clay or a pottery
huh i was told ceramic lasts 10-2x longer
price not being a concern here, how come
ok ok, i feel attacked
also in your opinion would a good upgrade for speedy linear rails be ceramic bearings
thats good right
gotta do it
daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang
oh yeah, hiwin is the cherry mx of linear rails
but i do agree '3d printer' stuff is over priced
because mine are surprising perfectly smooth with a wee bit of wobble
like 5 pounds per rail
fancy panels or wasted money
my entire build is roughly 300
bruh, thats maybe not a good idea
anything with demensions or volume is like quantum physiscsto me
bruh, i dont understand 3d
same
i have no 3d perception so unless ive designed somnething i have no clue how to assemble it
not ducthdude but dont worry, i flooded the server trying to figure out how to assemble a afterburner
print a adapter to hold those clamps to the bottom of the extrusion theyre mounted on. then use a long slotted hole to allow for adjustments or just put two holes and hope it works
Well in <#818601696702889984> you can ask about the printer and we'll do our best to answer
klipper is designed for better quality at higher speed
marlim has a worse motion planner (lining up movements and executing commands)
speed
try screws and a kinematic ball camera mount
reduces ringing
cancelling out vibrations with moves
which was 9 days ago wich means on average we get 11 new members
since the v2 launch we've grown  by nearly 100 members
so a 3rd gen i7's integrated graphics isnt a good idea to run sw on
fairly certain apple was sandbagging their intel pcs to make the m1 appear better
its next level, im not 100% sure how it stacks up to other cpus but its a beast of a machine
my jankiest setup was when i had 4 heaters electrical taped to a heater block
cheers
i spent roughly 6hrs on my linear rails cleaning, re lubing, removing excess metal, smoothing and lapping plus re machining a channel
my firmware is the shit part, i dont understand it at all, but my wiring and physical stuff
cause my entire zero g build cost ¬£270 including the ender 5 i bought
you mean something really dodgy that barely works
whats that
A <@173827530929733632>. I dont think we need a private channel, they only encourage people to stick to certain channels,  I personally dont mind people speaking different languages since it's no ones responsibility to speak english
i dont print abs often so aslong as my ambient air temp fan/thermistor works it will be fine
the enclosure will have a vent fan, i dont want it to heat up
All thats left is the front panel and my pay wiring
if i use a heater pin do i need to add anything extra
thanks
Oh but do I replace with the pin for my fans pin
Not great
i just need them to turn on at a set temp
im using the heaters for fans
<@!244874310592757771>  The `pin: extra_mcu:PB4` is that a temp sensor pin or a fan header
You are a life saver. Thank you so much, ill try it in the morning and let you know how it goes
ill fix this in the morning
i had that setup but they never triggered
im trying to get 3 sets of fans to turn on when a thermistor reads a certain temp
ive got a secondary board to run fans and thermistors from
yep, gimme one sec
what would i change it to to receive a tmp from the pi
nah, i had it working earlier but changed the config since it wasnt working the way i wanted it to
this is the part thats giving me grief

HUH, CANT GET THE RAS PI TEMP
oh well
huh
in london, pretty much next to greenwich and my pc says 10
its 10pm gmt but no stream
i think the giveaway times on the discord are wrong
Too far apart, I would be better off using a heatpipe to connect them to a heatsink
Welp, I'm sure they'll be fine with passive cooling
Ah, no way to get 2 to off one slot
These are 24v fans running on 24v, except theres 2 of them so they get roughly 12 and a stall or surge wont break them
I have one nore controllable slot but need 2. So if I run 2 24v fans on 24v they each get 12 and in theory if one stalls the other gets 24v
Can I wire 2 24v fans together to give them 12v each at max
Ill be moving all the elctronics to a double stacked panel on the side for easy acces
Enclosure made of cardboard panels and screws works surprisingly well and takes 10m to assemble
Figured they would look cool under a microscope, the second one is the wires, in the background you can see the ridges of my fingerprint and the wires are barely as thick as those
Macro of a glass bead thermistor
so i just flash it as normal and set it as a second board
<@!451709396280410132>
when i flash klipper to my second board, is there anything special to do or is it just normal klipper
Thanks for the help
Cool
Although I worry about little strands heating up
That way it has more surface contact
I was just gonna fan it out and screw in the terminal
Dont Solder the wire to the terminal or dont solder it anywhere?
As long as none of it is sticking out I think it's fine but idk
Do I need it or can I just use the screw to hold down a bare wire
Ive got the wrong type of insulation spade
Which is why vez is getting a magnum plus
All we need now us a hotend to keep up
Also I cant wait to see odrive or a really good 4wd
I was just gonna glue another heater to the bed and have it run at the same time and mimic the preexisting one
I'm just gonna have both go on or off at the same time since its less effort, I just want to put less strain and get faster heating from 2 pads
So I get bettee heat up times and less stress on the fets
And can I use a heater port on my second board as a secondary heater, e.g when the bed heats up both heaters turn on
Ah thanks
Can the heater pin be anything cause I need the actual heaters
So I set my thermistor pin in there and when my heater+generic reports a certain temp the fan turns on
i have a temp sensor for all my electronics and a chamber temp sensor
im trying to get cooling for steppers, pi, drivers and anything else that gets warm
how do i link a fan to the temp reported on a thermistor
Do a corner ans try a cube
after the first layer, it lifts completely
nop
in my very specific use case it isnt worth it but it all depends what your environment is like
and the temp thing is nice although i havent had those problems
well aslong as your careful it wont break but im not all too carful
and physical debris will mess with a bltouch wheres i can probe my bed with a print on it while ona inductive probe
yep
whereas bltouch doesnt need any adjustments but will break much easier
inductive probes are good but wont work on all surfaces
The chamfer is .24mm I think so it just makes everything the right size
Ill probably get some new parts or just clean up my room
Weekend
Same. I got nothing to do but yay
Well you can do threads in resin quite well
This printer or this rocket in integzas video
You can adapt any correct tool changer as long as it fits to run on the mercury
Thanks
B Ut ill try
On a budget so mine will probably just b3 painted black
either way ill avoid them
how come
any reason to get button head screws or the cylinder head ones
but my layerwidth was scaled acordingly so it was all good
poggers?
and the vase i printed was indestructable
the filament was movinbg like it was in a timelapse, but it was real time
so im buying another but i figured i would see what a 1.2mm nozzle was like
aliexpress messed up my order with a 1.2mm nozzle
<@!173827530929733632> 2mm layers
I'm going back to .6
Extruder is moving faster than my x axis
Dude my printer cant keep up
and my gears are flying
ill video it buit its so weird looking
the layer are so fucking PHAT
nah its custom, thanks for the tip
huh it works dreamily on a 3rd gen i7
just my preffered slicer
fucken ridiculous
lol, i can print layer height of 2.3mm
IT IS TOO LARGE
uhhhhhhhhh cura doesnt support my nozzle size
<@173827530929733632>. With my 1.2mm nozzle I should be able to achieve the same strength you get with 3-4 walls with one wall if 1.42mm thickness and layer height of 0.6mm
Much better now
First one is after polishing and cleaning, the first is rough and has machining marks and a ton of sharp edges
Dang I'm trying to spread the cost out and keep cost low. Ill be slowly upgrafing from v0 to mercury to 4wd to 5160 and on and on
Yep 500 at 40k works
I havent done input shaper yet since I'm waiting for my adxl345 to arrive
Yep, I'm just trying to push go to the limit regardless of ringing especially since its gonna be wall mounted
Ill try speed, I want accel to be stupid high, but I will try 500 at 30k
I suppose lower speed would fix it
Nah just skips
Ill do it and upload it
You mean the earthquake machine one
Yep thats the circle I just did from his cfg
<@173827530929733632>. Any other tests to attempt
Also look how much it moves forward and back from the side profile
Its gonna die any second
Any other gcodes you want me to use
Also <@173827530929733632>. Its done. Ive got the printer moving at 350mm/s and 125kacc its about to upload on yt. Ill link it
The balls can be upgraded to ceramic very easily too
I've dropped mine a few times and its fine
Whats wrong with the carriage
Silly me. Why didn't I think of that
Ohhhh
Ohh so if it goes into the nozzle hole does the heater thread in, then where does the plastic go, I assume around the outside of the nozzle
Ah good, where does the heater go.if the molten plastic keeps the thermistor in place and the heater gets clamped into place. Wheres the heater
Do I NeEd ThErMAl pASte To FiLl The GaP
WhY Is It ThReAdEd It JuSt ClAmpS In
Also I mostly use 5-15 pound filament so its quality is kinda doo doo so this nozzle Should be able to pass it through without clogging
It was meant to be .4 tho
My cr10s pro. Its slow but I like its big layers on .8 so instead of returning I will use it on my cr10
<@173827530929733632>. The 3 dollar volcano upgrade in all its glory, the quality isnt terrible
One good thing is that I dont need to buy a hardened steel nozzle for the e3d since the nozzles are both m6 thread
It was the wrong nozzle size and block style (glass bed thermostat) but it fits on my cr10 so I guess I'm gonna be using a 1.2mm nozzle now
So the price reflects quality
Nozzle quality. This cost a grand total of 29 cent
<@207570472647262208>. Check serial request
check <@!451709396280410132> 's stream and ask him to move through some menus
whereas mainsail looks more feature rich and has many tabs instead of one big page of info
fluidd is very minimalistic
much better than fluid
nice
which interface
<@!451709396280410132>  is that mainsailos
indeed its ~100 more
welcome
Welcome everyone
ah bertoo designed a insert and recessed hole that says merc and has space for that logo
hi techniak
thats all dutchdudes design but the afterburner inserts are bertoos
greetings
Hello trinni
Also its much easier to just get 50 tnuts of each kind (unless more are needed) these come in handy for almost every project I've done
Just use the corresponding tnuts
Well wich screws connect to the frame
ive @you in the comments of the post
welcome!#
ill cross post
ill comment and upvote
try the wires
But check those wires
Perhaps more steps doesnt always equal better
Huh. I may be wrong then
more steps translates to a smoother rotation wich is the same as increasing microsteps
technically .9 is quieter but there have been incidents were they appear louder, have you tried disabling stealthchop and upping the esteps or klipper equiv. also check that they arent missing steps for any reason, also try switching the 2 inner wires on the cable
tbf its only because i try respond to all the questions
got worried there
oh man
nice
ooo i just noticed, i got the OG role, nice
true, can you@me when its up
no problem
<@!173827530929733632>
Also you should make a official anouncment on reddit
Guarantee its gonna start blowing up
I see
Congrats <@173827530929733632>
Auyyyy beta is oit
First sensorless homing vid
Jesus Christ. 760 total views on one vid
Welcome
ill check that later
dang thats fast
dang, lucky. just wait til theyre teens and want their own printer
get him interested in STEM now and set him up for life i guess
unfortanute
Nah late night, early morning
Helo
<@!173827530929733632> , these
cheers
anyone know the brackets that vez3d uses on the vezbot for the 90 degree extrusion
i do think its the fastest ive seen on a ender
nice
i restarted the printer manually, guess the pi had a brain fart
uh, ok klipper
wich is by no means bad
we are gonna get flooded with people
lol, 31 more people til 400, we are growing, and fast
greetings
why not
we should get a welcome channel and evrytime someone joins, evryone whos active @them and greets them
I was gonna try it on the linear bearings, like how miragec has ptfe (dry) grease on his
I have some fast drying silicone lube I could try on my printer, would it work
Should have space for just 1
i couldnt download it, it said i didnt have acces
Bmg gear it too low, how would I raise it so the shell xan close
if i had anything near jeff bezos money i would be hiring dutchdude, miragec and vez3d to build me a 1000mm/s printer with custom hotends and boards
lmao
Not a bad idea. Ill make a ton of fidget spinners and be able to buy flange bearings. I could make 20 fidget spinners at 6 bucks a pop I would make 120 of of 10 bucks of material
lol. you mean sell them or are those 2 separate events
I was thinking use them with vslot wheels and a extrusion to support the other part of the bed
Ive got a ton of bearing and nothing to do with them, any suggestions
i dont think theres anything else you need
ill just look at the printable shells
i just wanted something with less weight
yeah
preferably with nema17
does anyone know a good bmg reshell
at least every corner is solid now, i tried a test at 400mm/s and 100k accel and 50k decel and 20mm/s cornering and the thing ttried commiting suicide and jumped off the desk, so my frame is solid
yeah i dont reccomend them, theres better options but they were on sale for ¬£2 and free shipping
also its pretty cool, this guys got the same board as mine wich means an easy peasy upgrade, and hes using hevacs (his adaptation) wich ill also steal
they arent printed, i will probably buy these but mine are pretty good already
ive got some brackets in everycorner already
yeah im planning on being as cheap as possible so ill probably use his parts on a ender 5 frame without the enclosure parts
i plan on using my Zero-G to print the parts for a hybrid mercury/vezbot
Is it using a endstop and pin to probe the bed
whats that
tbf ive never seen one slip
theres 2?
it has a grub screw for connecting
nope
ooo is it released
Any bass and it sounds like a feeble fart
Mine seems to play anything with a higher pitch fairly well
True but ill be getting bigger pulleys so everything is equal
ill be spending ~5 for a complete overhaul +belts maybe. its gonna be so worth it
easy peasy for a free upgrade
<@!173827530929733632>  it looks like a simple cut with tinkercad will fix it up and it will only need 4-8 cuts
if anything a larger bend is best for the belt
on what?
worth it if its free
i see, so the solution is larger pulleys on motors so everything is equal, i lose some resolution and torque so ill use more microstepping
if they are all this size i dont see this being a problem, although the size differnce may be negligible, whats the dimensions of your bearing
diameter 16
also, theyre each 5mm thick
how come
This is what it looks like, 2 of these in a printed case with a lip will be perfect
nah they arent standard 608rs
WDYM?
<@!173827530929733632> the bearings from the vslot wheels look easy to convert to flange bearings and are fairly high quality and sealed , looks like ive got a free upgrade to mercury. reuse the washers between flange bearings, reuse their m5 screws, reuse the  bearings and buy pins
here it is
yes i believe it is higher torque still, its just dont expect similar torque at 400mm/s as 10mm/s <@!173827530929733632>
technically yes, they will run cooler if running a 2.0A nema17 but nema23 have a drastic drop off in torque during high rpm
Lmao I love the ability to change microstepping in klipper . ive got my printer on 2x microstepping and it sounds likr a machine gun. And at 8x, 8 bit music sounds quite good
Oh good. Ill send it as soon as I can
Yep. When do you want it
Same as me. Do you want my config as a starting point
which board are you on?
no problem, i got my sensorless homing working fairly well, if you need any help just dm
nope, you have to cut them to not sensorless home
And since my pins are dubious at best it occasionally doesnt work fully
Once
less cabling, more flexibility for homing, cleaner, easy to tune only downside is a small lack of reliability but its never off by much, maybe a quarter of a mm at MOST
sensorless is far superior imo
Dont worry your just slot. Just make sure they face the right direction
<@402169283167256589>
These guys just slot in
No no, my was missing a pin so I had to solder one in
Lucky for you they came with the diag pin
Nice
troodon i beleive isnt open source but follows the voron 2.4 very closely
whats the printer name
hm, might be the tiny moves at the end of the top layer at a 45 degree angle, try 90 degree top layers
perhaps you hit a volumetric limit and in the end the filament solidified and shifted the hotend
is it a solid layer
only the last ones?
i might get a few of them then
Also heres my z screw. Its fairly straight
What are thrust bearings?
mine does that
oh good
Can I use the slider to slow it down or do I have to do it in config
So it would be trying to move at 1200mm/s
Ohhh I have mine set ridiculously high incase I ever want to go fast
<@!451709396280410132>  get a serial request while youre at it
<@!234475400313569280>  whats the macro's in your config file do, i tried the x test and my motors just started skipping
yeah, that looks pretty good, for the rods insert them and loosely tighten them so they stay in place, then move the bed all the way up and tighten then move down and tighten then back up and loosen then tighten then down tighten then loosen and that gets them fairly straight
Yeah its pretty huge
The sparkles on the second image are from jagged edges or 'flash' wheres the hugh quality one is smooth with sharp edges
Massive difference between the 2
<@234475400313569280>
Wheres the high quality one is smooth with well defined teeth
The lower quality is much rougher and has a 'sparkly'look to it
Lower quality
Higher quality
they will generate less heat over the same time at higher speed
well motors run coolest at higher speeds
I gor drv something or others for their 48v
wuich is a great cheap upgrade instead of 0.9 steppers
if not a 16t idler gives more torque and higher resolution
also at 400mm/s would i be getting close to my rpm limit
ill take some comparison shots with a microscope
oooh, i may need to upgrade mine then, i do have some nice ones from my other printer made of hardened steel
ive got some gates belts from trianglelabs but im just gonna use some high quality flange bearings later
<@!234475400313569280>  MGN9 carriages use 1/16‚Ä≥ (1.58mm)
gonna have to find the size  but i think the listing has a lot of different sizes
they should be much quieter and require less grease, i have ep2 grease its not too bad but it was much better with oil
yep
i was looking at some over sized and under sized balls for mine, too see what was better, but i couldnt find any with a small size down
hehehehehh
ahh, so they jump around kinda
whats chatter, do they shake
also the ceramic balls have a longer lifespan
it would wear less with ceramic balls, less friction means less need for lube
unless it comes as a powder than you can roll the balls in
i assume so, ill be dissasembling my blocks and spraying the balls, shaking them up and re spraying, for the rail im just gonna take it out side and douse it
yup
if it all goes well ill be combining both dry lube and ceramic bearings
let me know how that goes
so im shooting for the moon and hoping to land among the stars
fair enough, i want 800mm/s moves and printing at 300m/s and acc of 100k
ill be using dry ptfe lube and just spraying it on more often
same, mine was perfect except for a slightly misaligned hole, when should they be arriving
also, did you get high quality blocks or cheap ones
please @me when that happens, i dont wanna waste any money on something useless
More than all my linear rails together
No that's expensive
oh man 25 pounds for all the parts (new bearing and cf)
yep, and this only means losing a small amount of z or y
yep and if complicated enough, you could have multiple 'pods' with different sixe heat inserts to compare different rails
this only requires glueing and inserting a heated nut, less effort and print time
so that the rail is removable
if i expoxy it to the outside and it slots onto the beam, it will be as straight as the beam
If I 3d print a clip with spaces for a heated nut insert that gets epoxied to the cf tube I wouldnt need to be precise during mou ting as they would be self leveling
What about epoxging a 3d printed standoff with metal inserts
A thick epoxy would work for that
I see, but if it melts at 50. Heated inserts seems much easier
do heat inserts work on these cf tubes
<@!179670325351415808>  the shipping isnt great on those bearings, 4 bucks for 36-63 day shipping
tbf the weight saving to cf tube is ~300g so may aswell get even lighter
weight savings arent worth it for the non standard size, you're bettwer off getting slightly beefier steppers
im gonna but them now, so cheap and so worth it
expensive but maybe worth it
66 per block
well do we need grease if we have silicon nitride balls
<@!179670325351415808>  'Silicon nitride bearing balls have up to 80% less friction and a 3-10 longer lifetime than traditional metal bearings. In addition, they can operate at significantly higher speeds, have less weight, have higher maximum operating temperatures and run better with limited lubrication.' seems like these and some light dry grease is the best idea
i wonder if some light oil and dry lube would last longer, or if thats just counter productive
I wont be using a enclosure so no worrys about that epoxy. That Teflon is used ln bikes all the time but I will look at other options like graphite for a dry lube
im probably going to buy new bearings for my rails and clean and relube my rails with the dry grease and remove my x axis extrusion in favor of something else, cooling ill get hevacs for but thats down the road, for now ive got a pretty clear upgrade path
just saw miragec's new video. it seems he recommends klipper, carbon fiber tubes, dry ptfe grease and tons of cooling for his abs
mk
anyhow join whenever youre ready and ill set it off
also im trying to design a belt tensioner that uses rubber bands/string to tension the belt wich means with the correct length of string you cant over tension the belt, no matter how hard you try
first test should be on highest sensitivity and checking it wont move, if that happens i should be fine
this looks very promising
x axis has the fix, y axis doesnt
alright, it went in easy peasy
if i have the endstops configured to be open right now without a pin, should i change it to not be inverted as it is now
ill live stream it attempting to home in a sec
i have no clue
welllll, funny question, does it work
No shorts. Clean solder
it looks kinda crap tho
<@!173827530929733632>  it is done
is it ok if theyre a few mm shorter than the rest
oh cool, ill do both
im about to give it a shot with some dupot pins i stole from some male-male conncetors
<@!173827530929733632>  do i sauter in 1 pin or both of the missing pins
is the vertical extrusions just 240mm
ive done it, its not to bad, use a knife to start it and then use any old saw to cut the rest
oh, but i can just desolder it if it doesnt work facing downwards
ah, as in the pin will be in different places on each drivger?
could you send a front on photo of the driver if you have the 2209's
never mind, it wasnt going in straight
the slot it goes into has very short 'travel' whereas the others are normal and have full 'travel'
trying to sauter in a new pin
also is it shorter than the others
can someone send me a photo of the diag pin on their 2209
ohhh
@ me when you do
alright, wich hole does it go in on the chip
i have 2209, checked the chip and theey are 100% 2209
i think they have that but are missing a pin
i will check i wasnt duped and sent the wrong chip, but their layouts are identical
the listing is for both, the layout is also identical on both of these stepsticks (2208/2209)
if this is the under side wich pin do i sauter in
heres the driver with its missing pin
yepper, im checking ali to see if they reccomend soldering a pin
the moving y is from the x crashing, i havent checked if the x moves during y though
back right
not sure why
Invalid homing_positive_dir / position_endstop in 'stepper_y'
set endstop position to 0 and get this error
lemme try something real quick
nope
never mind, my cables are too short to swap, pins it is
ya know ill just swap cables, less effort. if it works ill do pins
cool
step pins  or dir pins
although its only when moving the y axis thats wrong
ill try that, the pin inversion  didnt work
ill try that
cool, ill browse google and see if i can find it if not could you send it later
how do i invert my y axis on corexy
nice
so remove one of them? or change it to p1.29?
brand new install

Unknown value 'P1_29' in enumeration 'pin'
This type of error is frequently caused by running an older
version of the firmware on the micro-controller
[tmc2209 stepper_x]
uart_pin: P1.10
diag_pin: P1_29
run_current: 0.66
stealthchop_threshold: 90
interpolate: false
driver_SGTHRS: 127  # 255 is most sensitive value, 0 is least sensitive
ah so ill do 0.66
oops, ill set it to 0.98
2209 and stock steppers
i set it to 1.2 on stock, is that too high
Is ther a way to run the input shaper test without collecting data
Height or width
you can do up to 6 (most ive seen) but 3 is already plenty
Dang. I got mine off aliexpress, fairly certain shipping was more than the rails
anyways i have to go
yeah ive done the most budget version of everything, my hotend cost ¬£8 and my lin rails ¬£18
a final version is very unlikely, its prob ably gonna keep improving as time goes on, im waiting til v3 for my next build
well you can make it from a square frame and a diy z
you could adapt it to the stock wheels and add spacers to the appropiate places but linear rails are reccomended
but its looking very polished
as i can see, very very close, i think (im not an official source) the beta will open within the next month or month and a half
started with designing new parts, devolved into a 'just chatting stream'
dont worry, if you prefer anonymity use <#802668875518967888>
in the vc
<@!451709396280410132>  theres a live stream now of some parts being designed or touched up on, you can take a peek
because you may aswell use corexy and get even more speed gains
you mean a crossed beam printer?
they drop off in torque at higher rpm
you mean 23?
in the end you can either run quiter or cooler at the same torque or at higher torque and noise
or 4 2amp steppers for tons of noise and torque
you can either use quieter motors that draw less current at the same total torque
2 sets of 2 motors either with each set in series or with 4 drivers
And better prints with 4 motors instead of 2 and 12mm belts plus hevacs (large general cooling) and berd air (precise and incredibly topographic cooling for small features)
You can save the most weight by going bowden, using llastic screws and using the v2 (less plastic on moving parts) and by using a cut down but very stiff toolhead and replacing the x axis extrusion with carbon fiber tubes
It seems the clay printer (on sale for 319 on kicmstartter) has beat this time by 5s
it is, scroll down to the speedboat text channels and read the rules and see other entries
lemme check
yes, i beleive this is run from the annex engineering discord
and ive got a few mounting holes leftover for additional mounts (e.g adxl345 and probes or direct drives)
just assembled the voron 2.2 toolhead and its so nice, the mounts for the actual hotend are suuuper simple so i can add my own hotends later on (just a makeshift rigid mount volcano) i 100% reccomend it for a afterburner setup
huh, i just lower my line width and keep the layer height 1/4 of the line width
thinnest wall i can print with quality is .3mm which is alright
damn, impressive
so upgrade and up the line width to .8 for functional parts and for detailed drop to .4
<@!347144798102093825>  the lack of detail with .8 vs .4 is massive but i can print with a line wisth of .6 quite well, so you could use a .6 nozzle and a line width of .4 to emulate a .4 nozzle
i personally havent but you could easily install any printer axis that uses a 2020 frame (cube) and just mount it to the e5. the hardest part would be connecting that z axis to the bed
no no, i meant the april fools part, but that lgx and cf nylon printer is gonna be so dope
really
bruh
f
<@!347144798102093825>
want me to print off a mini real quick
i use .8
Yeah same I was expecting a full release
huh? you mean the prusa corexy?
once you finish it
ah, so.. ya know how ive really procrastinated on firmware, could you send my your config for the v1.4
nice
Thin wall test on .8mm nozzle. Wall measures .3mm <@173827530929733632>
<@!173827530929733632>  lemme know  how the v1.4 goes
fair enough then
heheh, its been shipped, awaiting delivery
oh that other one was fine
dang thats expensive
Nice. Althpugh mine comes with heartbreak and nozzle and block and thermistor
spending ¬£3 for a volcano, wish me luck
thank you
ahhh
yeah trianglelabs have some good quality stuff
13.1x cheaper than other hotends and is 4 pounds cheaper to get a super volcano, this is all compatible with the stock creality hotend which makes it even cheaper and easier to mount (2 screws)
total upgrade kit including block, thermistor and nozzle
<@!500079262460674059>
<@414614473496723469>. If you need a upgrade for something higher flow I found that this fits onto a microswiss and cost less than 10 bucks
fair enough
but is that a high quality clone
total $9 or ¬£7~8
fantastic nozzle made of copper with extra snaz coating
good enough hot block
<@!500079262460674059>
yes but a cheap block and a mediocre nozzle only sets you back ~¬£10 wheres a new hotend is 10x that
the volcano does have higher output (volumetric)  but it has worse retractions and such
well for simplicity and cost this is a good upgrade (mounts are also super easy to make for this style)
<@!414614473496723469> , pretty cool upgrade
looks like a volcano block works on most hotends
wdym, its the only insulated one?
or fibreglass
looks like a braided nylon type thing
lol same
you could have a choir serenade you while you ptint
or single z and a choir of stepper motors
i think ive already done that for the heatsink fan
which second output
i guess my next upgrade is flashing cr10s fw on the skr and buying the spider
bruh and here i am with skr v1.4 and one controlable fan, pwm or controllable fan
you can try using a adapter to replace the x extrusion and save 400g or use a cf square profile and drill holes
looks pretty good
ah, better luck next time
dang, that sucks. maybe the shipping company can do a switcheroo or you could arange a switcheroo
if ae refunds and you get the right parts sent to you its a win-win
try the shipping company for recourse on taxes or getting the right thing sent to you
o crap
if its alixpress open a dispute and get a rufend
oh no
its gonna be so cursed
functional
im part way through 3d printing a mgn 12h rail
<@!173827530929733632>  your gonna hate this
yep
<@!173827530929733632>  can we get one channel for a ton of pinned things e.g every mod or reccomended upgrade
true, true
but an oven is cheaper, and im stingy
wish i had one of those
Let me know if it works or goes well
<@!179670325351415808>  this is perfect- i can collect others filament and sell it to them at ¬£2 more than it costs to make and advertise it as for custom blends or cheap filament
ill see if i can visiit one if im ever nearby
like find a uk manufacturer and piggyback off their technique
ill sleep on it for a few months
true
yes, its one of the big reasons im considering the project instead of doing it
and i can create custom one off blends for people at a high cost
im going to mix the filament with some other additives
well tolerance wise ill have a auto winder
im looking at building my own shredder and extruder as my next project, i was thinking of accepting scraps and sorting them then extruding them and sending the filament back on a spool for a small-ish fee
yeah, hey dreamcat have you ever looked at recycling filament scraps
so its just bad
ew
oof
the color is nice but those lines are
oh dang, thats a shame, their website is pretty crap too
<@!179670325351415808> , matte eco friendly pla with shipping included in price
this is pretty good, i think
Oh well, it'll probably be fine, thanks for the help
thank you, it says 2.0A but the pi needs 3.0A. should the wire specify it allows 3.0A
yep
alright, well since ive only got one- im going to buy one of those wires and try again
cool
ill probably end up getting one at some point, so yeah
ohhh, ill cut the wires and strip them again. so i avoid getting sauter on the end of the wires, right?
is that bad
no multimeter
uh, i took the positive and negative wires from a power only usb cable and sautered them to the positive and negative terminals
They dont touch
Nope
Ill check
Wich part, where they meet?
yeah, ive got a few fire alarms in my room and a fire door, so im not too worried
true, im just gonna take the chance and go for cheapo stuff for anything that wont suply high power
yeah some stuff is really good, but others...
eh, refund is easier
oh well
lmao, i mean which part of my wiring
yeah i honestly have no clue what broke it
yep, my room stinks of magic smoke now
those are just + and - wires, theres no gnd in the wire
yeah, any clue why, tbf it cost 80 cents but i thought it would work
and burned me with sparks
its cracked
its
dc, from the stock psu
dc to dc
Also is it not possible to over amp (I dunno how this works)
It still powers up but the lcd is just showing '000'
I think I "over amped it" if that makes sense or is possible
Do you think it still works?
And
I plugged in my converter
So uh
Nice
Also this joint will never move which is why I didnt bother doing it with proper strain relief
I just used 2 books to crimp a spade connector
<@500079262460674059>. First time soldering. Dont think I did to bad
Dope
Those small holes nect to the screw terminal, can I sauter wires in there since my usb wires are too small for screw terminals
unfortanutly we cant spend our full day on 3d printing so their development could leap forward overnight or be a little stagnant for a week, but it will be very soon
probably within the next month but take that with a grain of salt, it could be 2 or 3
lmao, ill probably buy min, since its so cheap
lol
yep, less weight with a fancier looking setup
apart from the 400g chunk of metal supporting it
im doing bowden with 48mm steppers and a barebones hotend with part cooling mounted on the side of the printer
it was just cheaper for these smaller pieces, but s adapter can be made so it screws in normally at both ends and for the rail a bracket would work
10x lighter than my aluminum extrusion
40g for 400mm
this looks pretty good for a replacement for my x axis extrusion
yeah makes sense, it gets the opposite of thermal expansion
Also temperature difference can mean the top sets before the bottom@middle which creates a vacuum which makes it inplode
Yes but during setting it heats up really hot and expands, then contracts
You may end up melting or popping the part
Careful with the epoxy expanding and heating when it kicks
Then try parts for the hotend with ht epoxy
Maybe use in epoxy to cast the parts for the mercury one for lightweight but strong printer parts
ah nevermind then
are you in the uk
dunno, had it saved on my phone
nice, i knew i had it saved somewhere
Is this good, it's got a transparenr background
I thought the github had, lemme look
Check the github
Also, would I benefit from using a cf rod over nothing or is it a lot stronger
also, how does he only have 2 belts
now im cnsidering a cf rod
Or no clue
Is the super whopper better than a different motor because it's from e3d or is any motor of same spec as goor
bruh
so it can heat indefinetl if you enter a PIN
lol, mine allows you to switch off the timeout function
wait, thats gonna take a while, thats 1mm/m right
lol my printer got 20mins in then shutoff
in my shed in the summer (black walls/roof) with no air con
damn, impressive, the best i got was 60
nice, that looks pretty good
ptfe tube guide is definetly a good idea, on bowden printers nah but as a guide for direct driev it would work
noice, would a drilled hole in the extrusion weaken it because it could secure onto the extrusion and go straight through a hole
hey could the cable chain on the y axis not lie underneath the y axis and travel down the back
if that 30 gbp resin printer allows for slicing prints and printing them i would 100% do this
just watched that rocket, i realy need a resin printer,  have access to the kiln but no resin printer
well it could run along top of x and under the y
yeah, tats much better
how would you rather have it hang
mine doesn't drag too much it seems to sit pretty nicely but the tubing is pretty packed
I just use some spiral cut tubing
Lol
just l shaped brackets from aliexpress, they are a pain to install and normal ones would work equally aswell just these are cleaner
So worth it. 3 brackets in every corner snd the frame feels sturdy as fuck. It barely wobbles and most of the flex is from the aluminum being bendy
Havent got it printing yet. I wanna perfect everything physical before the printing begins
I have no speed square so its gonna be a pain. Either way im just gonna rebuild from scratch and install a lot of square brackets
This is gonna be a pain in the assss
Install brackets and keep it square
In gonna have to take the whole thing apart
My printer isn't close to square
Oh carp
In having a great time trying to put this printer back together
Nice
Ayy
I guess ill just take it apart now
After I built the printer
My brackets finally arrived
Lol
personally, i dont know of any issues with the latest version from trianglelabs but there may be underlying issues
Oh good. Ill print that then. Thank you
I was gonna do the afterburner but I realised its for mgn9 rails so I'm holding off til I figure out how to mount on 12h
wish me luck, im aboutta start a 6hr print for the afterburner
The v2 releases very soon probably with the step files but v1 is currently out but buikding it is strongly discouraged
<@!500079262460674059>  do you still have your cfg from your v1 or if you modified someone elses, whose was it
Nice
So the farthest left belt goes all the way around and to the head and the inner part on the left goes straight to the head
no prob, ill fumble through it
if your v1 is still together can you take a couple photos of the belt path
fair enough, good luck
yeah, if you have a spare pipe cutter sitting around them maybe heating the rod and cutting a groove in the rod will help if you cut it, if you sand it put in some ear protection and get cozy- it might take a while
ah, unfortanute
also if its smooth rods cant you just have the poke a few mm out of the holder
no problem, just hold the rod steady and start on a low-ish grit and finish high ( and deburr the edges)
if its a few mm a electric sander may be better
either way, be careful and wear arm/hand protection as well as eye protection
so make sure its either a very fine toothing or a abrasive disc
but any thing mechanical should probably not have teeth on it- the teeth may bounce off the rod and cause injury
i used a cutting guide and handsaw
Ive got my cr10 to be slow and reliable, eventually imma kit it out with a .3mm nozzle for accuracy
That's the only thing I need from my printer
Fair enough
Can I @ everyone for the poll
Lol. Wee bit late
Ah, if your bothered to it would be cool to see but idm (I do suggest doing @ here to get morw votes) and what Kyle said
Ive mentioned it a few times and seen others suggest it
<@173827530929733632>. Can you add reddit to the poll
alright, thanks for the help
ok good, just wanted to check it was user error, not me printing in a different material
yes
so i should size them up by 1%
for abs shrinkage
hey <@!173827530929733632>  the parts are designed for abs right, so theyre over sized by 1%
dang the server is blowing up
but when my upgrade kit arrives its gonna be so much better
its good enough for the ¬£5 i spent on it
my bmg just arrived
get in
Next Time I'm using the lowest torque on my drill
Used a electric screw driver and over tightened everything
Never mind. Both halves
Time to reprint 1 half with slightly bigger holes
I drilled some holes too big and stripped a screw
Ah christ
This or the next one
<@173827530929733632>. Which way do I orientate the x axis idler
V1
not too far off from getting my serial number
then belts wich is a PITA then firmware then hotend and extruder
just finished printing and installing the x axis, except i installed it wrong so i have to undo that and redo it
lol, i just leave my lights on
Ohhhh, very fancy
What was that
Wait
ah its only dual pin
remember √≠ve only got 1 controllable slot, so its better to just use one fan
well yes, but no, they have less cfm and static pressure than the delta fan but in theory they usually have a higher static pressure
Nice and cheap
What is it?
also we want the duct to have the least static pressure inside, but a fan with high static pressure is better
please share
so higher cfm means wider duct
dang, so his has more force behind it and ours pushes more air, so we would need a smoother, shorter duct
nice
so we would be able to run these at 60% and have roughly equal cooling to his, or split them in 2 and have equivalent cooling
negative pressure cooling on my board and positive pressure cooling of my parts with 1 controllable fan seems pretty good
i guess you could split it into 2 and it would still be good though
but man, 30 bucks
well 2 is good enough so this fan seems perfect
holy crap 240cfm, whats static pressure
noise is no problemo for me, we just need to find a 2 pin fan with high cfm (amount of air pushed) and decent static pressure (how much force is behind that air). if we have one without the other the hevacs will be useless
lol, it worked, and its much quieter, and since its a 12v fan i can 'overclock' it to 14v (better cooling) by setting a different fan speed
2 opinions that agree are good enough for me
cool
also, i dont have a multimeter
dont worry this is just for a fan, i dont think i can break anything by doing this wrong
thank you so much
And is red or black negative
Does anyone know if yellow or blue is positive or negative typically on creality machines
fair enough
hey <@!179670325351415808>  how do i test the resolution of my webcam
dayum the minimum focus distance is really close
oh thank god, now to check on the pi
i might look for one then
yeah, atleast amazon accepts returns easily
nah nah, 360 degree o you could watch in vr. you could even pretend to be a printer nozzle!
yeah  dont have any other with manual focus
that would be pretty cool, i wonder if you could do a 360 degree camera under the print head
yeah i hope mine works, thankfully i hve another spare that fits but it has no mounts other than tape and is awful quality
ah true, well ill see if it works on my linux machine (pi is out on loan)
is it just linux that wont work
im on windows so ill see if it works there
mine arrives later today, just got a notification that its n the way
Damn its looking good, I dont even get half that quality at 30mm/s
Dang it. Well in a few weeks you guys can all watch me break my printer at my targeted 500mm/s
Dang, you gotta send me a clip of that then
No can do sorry, I've gotta head off to bed, tomorrow?
And then there were 4
Its triggered by a Allen wrench
Im using a physical limit switch on a loaner printer
Dang, ill have to get 1.0.1
Hey <@173827530929733632>. Just started x axis assembly, whats the m4 tnuts for . also noice pfp
not if you can wait 3 months for questionable quality from aliexpress
yeah its goes pretty quick
also i reccomend for the budget minded people, esun abs+
well now its 3
yep
whats a good endstop to use on my rails
im yonks away
well i would offer to print one, but ya know
you can print with the fan just pointing in the genarl direction of the hotend and just print a little slower
yes but for the fact that not many people are in the same country, for example theres only 1 other brit in this server that i know of, but its worth making one if anyone happens to need the parts
yep, we are getting ***fancy***
S
E
Y
ill just frankestien it together for a print then
bruh its off aliexpress and customs loves peeping into my mail
gcode running and all that just no extruder installed
dang, guess ill be taking a extruder from my other printer, or can it be 'printing' but without loaded filament
now i really gotta get the printer built, is it ok if it doesnt extrude, my extruder is gonna be really delayed, so can it just move
we're a proper fancy printer group now
we got serials
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
very nice
ill reprint it then post process and tell you guys how it went
surprisingly it came out pretty good but i forgot to swap to a glass bed
In the middle of a really slow petg print (clear lens) and my tnuts just arrived, and I cant print any aligners. üòû  just my luck
yeh im getting one later, absolute steal
2k manual focus camera for a pi, discount code makes it 9 quid
7PM2Q3MQ
ive got those, to stop them binding but i read somewhere it was betteer top screw it in either outside in or inside out
i know how to align my rails but i dont know if i should screw tem n from the middle out or from the out to the middle
i finally got my m3 nuts (customs had thrm)
also your duct may not be cooling the corrwect oart of your hotend
5015 is a fan size
does it wobble
is the nozzle sturdy
The zero g is gomna get a encloser
New dresser and printer space
Lol I had my cables wrapped in stiff wiring to stop it snagging or kinking
<@!173827530929733632>  you totally recommend i print this and use it, right?
so i did it without paying attention and becuase it was ¬£3 for 50 it snapped reeally easily
i had the wrong size mixed in with the right size when i bought a assorted box from amazon
now for the heat break
just got the nozzle out
oooo, yes i do
maybe, ill try that when im bothered to grab my saw
so now im scrapping the hotend for spares
nothing, i was an idiot and tightened everything way to tight, snapped a nozzle and gave up on it
but inside the block its threaded
its smooth on the outside part
i dont have one of those unfortunately, best i can do is boiling water
nah ill try cooling it then putting it in boiling water
what direction
so i just gotta wack it while holding it/the block with pliers
ive got plenty 'o' hands
ive tride that and boiling it, not sure what else at this point
unfortunately ive got none of that
also, any clue on how to remove a stuck heatbreak
probably find something there
search aliexpress for a metal bmg
drv8825 do 48v and when i upgrade to new steppers i plan on destroying my stock motors with high voltage just to see what they can do
thats veeery unlikely
ya know
but
lucky, im hoping to make a yt channel for this printer with a comprehensive guide on what i do to make it fast, then my end goal is to amass a good following and then receive free items to be featured on my printer
1/2 quid at most but im pretty close to dispatch (i think)
for anything sub 25mm i reccomend buying a assorted pack of screw+nuts
i got all the BOM and some nylon washers to go between my idlers
and the bags they come in are pretty nice
accu
gimme a sec
same, i just used a UK website
thats becuase the cost of other things (other than wire) cost more than wire, so profits are higher for larger spools
ahh in that case, feet are going to be better
you could use a lack table with the printer rigid mounted and decouple the legs from the top with springs/tpu
yep
but tpu works aswell
cnckitchen has a video showing mounting on a large heavy object thats been decoupled is the best
e.g bolt it to a shelf and use dampers on the shelf
i think rigid mount and decouple the table its mounted on
nah nah nah, im not in the middle of printing anything important so if it works on my printer than its an ok placeholder for a few prints
if its any good you an try it as a placeholder until proper parts arrive
ya know wat, ill try it this weekend on my cr10 and cause its cartesian i can easily isolate any issues to a single axis/part
well, in theory you could, in practice you would have lumpy prints and weird repeating patters since a printer cant do a perfect circle
bruh, 2-7 days, thats ages, i guess its worth trying although ive already attempted to make a pei bed with a sheet of metal and pei sticker and that doesnt have any bubbles
ill look at how to do that and try it out when my pei sheet arrives
whats a float install, if i buy this sheet i can try it
<@!347144798102093825>  the bed and pei together is ¬£15
this is the cheapest i could find so theres probably something wrong but, ehh
<@!173827530929733632>  i think i found a good deal on a pei sticker, if i get the 310x310 sheet cn i just stick it on my current bed (on the opposite side to my current sticker
@me if it falls but I gotta go
Print speed
So ya know
Its on fire tho
That was insane
30mm/s print speed
I might get a better fan and tape it over my y axis becuade none other overheat
True but I get weird skips at much higher than 30mm/s. I suspect cooling on the drivers to be the problem but its not worth the effort to fix
Launch in 5m
Yeh kinda stuck for adhesion so for now, hair spray is the best I can do
Either stick too well or nit at all
Yeah they disagree with my nozzle
Would thAt make it peel easier
Yep, I can slap a new sticker on my plate and have good adhesion but that's quite expensive ir at least out of my current price range
Its fairly repeatable but I haven't done any proper tests
Inductive probe
Same grainy texture too
True, ijt has the same maintenance procedure and behaves similarly to build tak, sticks too much then not at all
Same texture and feel but creality made. Its same sheeting and same sticker style but it's from a different brand
Is it not knockoff buildtak
Theres even lighting in this shot but the middle (where I sanded) is very shiny
Thsts how I got here, 240 grit is much to smooth, I might crack out the 90 grit but I had problems after sanding
This is 2+ year old build tak which has been through a lot of 'if bwd adhesions a problem just lower the nozzle duuuhh- z offset: -2mm'
55
Here it is
Buildtak
Its 10 GBP on Amazon but its a screw up batch its usually 18, lemme go dig it up
The brim is there because a few spots of my bed are quite smooth and filament won't stick so I use a brim
First layer is 5mm/s and bed is freshly clean before print. Ill turn off the fan and try hotter in the morning
Any clue?
Pla at 200 and reccomended layer height only change is 25mm/s and bigger line width
Also any clue why the bottom layer of my print peeled off with the brim? The rest is fairly sturdy just the first layer is funky
Theyre going again at half past
Can we get an F in the chat for the SN-10
Ive got those too. They're quite good. And 6m was 8GBP
But expensive
Nice
WhT length total belt
F
Ahh. I saw these more as similar performance but lighter versions wich I wont need to worry about too much as I'm going Bowden for now
<@179670325351415808>. I bought the bmg yesterday although it was a knockoff and only costed 5 quid so ya know it was worth it. What would be consideres current gen
Well the stuff from trianglelabs is pretty good but ive never bought any genuine parts
i agree with dream cat, i want 400mm/s+  and while i have the v6 (limiting factor) im gonna tune up the printer to run at those speeds, not while printing for now, then once i get those speeds im gonna buy whatever the best hotend is and use that to get suuper high speed printing
would using a larger pulley, e.g 34T and using a geared nema23 give a higher speed while keeping the torque of a 20t pulley (larger pulley=less torque/more speed/less resolution    smaller pulley=more torque/resolution/lower speed)
My electronics are in the way of where I wanted my belted z. Can I put it diagonal to my current z instead of opposite it (will I still have the support of a second z)
alright, well ill buy them for experimentation after i lighten the printer as much as possible, for now ill use 2209s
But would that be worth it
But drvs do 45v wich is even better
also if sounds not a problem could i use drv8825 step sticks, they seem to have a higher voltage capacity than the 2209s
(and have you seen a knockoff version i could purchase)
also has anyone tried the lgx extruder/ a knockoff of the lgx
in theory, yes but i dont know if that would be very accurate
Well, a good hammer and a lighter will get you pretty far for removing the plastic connector
yeah, its a good year until its a full fledged design, at least. but a similiar idea could be implemented, either way im gonna end up buying a heatlamp for abs prints
I'm off to bed now so I cant reply until the morning
I @you in the channels
just scrolling through the hevort discord, its a bit of a mess but they want to actively heat parts before they are printed over (for adhesion) and they wanna try using infrared lamps to heat a part and leave the build chamber open air, for all the guys who wanna do ABS this seems like a godsend of an idea (but for me the hevacs is better), so when these parts are realized could they be included in the next revision
Technically, yes but in practice, maybe not
belted z, its just using the stock parts/belts. its gonna be awful so its mostly to provide support for the second half of the bed
nice, mines nearly printed i just need a few tnuts
Hey dutchdude. Hows the guys extruder looking?
cool
nice, was it the 'wire swap'
also send a video if you an
what jhappwens now
also make sure your drivers are installed correctly
oh yeah if its nicely done, do it in config but if its a mess try it out
try it out, also what behaviour are you having upon homing
<@!347144798102093825>  whats your full setup and do you have all the wiring correct
hey <@!173827530929733632> , is the  any good looking
Tell me if it looks any good
Nice, I assume so but im not sure
He'll dm you the parts needes
Can send your discord to the guy
Wanna test it
<@173827530929733632>. Ive found someone claiming to have a sub 80g extruder
the only reason to use a4988s
pretty neat
didnt know superslicer had that
it lets you input ranges and creates tests then you inpu the best one, then it makes a slicer profile
free trial only, unless you pay, but this is a very cool website for dialing in 3d prints
im fairly certain it just scales up, so if the frame is bigger by a factor of 1.2 you would do 300mm x 1.2
noice, they look pretty good, when i get better rails (probably misumi), im just gonna spray paint them so i can have black rails
nice
im using the rail with grease on it on my y axis so its in conjunction with my other better rail
<@!234475400313569280>  is ep2 okay
yeah plain stuff is horrible lube
*wd-40 but specifically ptfe based, plain wd40 isnt ptfe based
oof, well if it is ptfe you should proabbly change it, and if you need to buy lithium grease and are eu based uero car parts has 500g for ¬£5
ptfe is no go for bearings
good
lithium grease/oil is better
ptfe lube has tiny chunks of ptfe in and causes bearings to prematurely wear down
oh no
honestly its cheaper to just buy the cheapest option and a spare more expensive block
i got mine for 20GBP total and all but one were perfect
what price did you buy them at
looks like smooth pei maybe or polycarb
same, i need one of those
ah
Is this the tft 24 on klipper?
yeah, next year im getting a ryzen 5 5600x and a 3070
only a gt1030! the horrors! good thing i have a mobile intel i3 first gen *underclocked* on passive cooling, phew
assuming a 0.4mm nozzle
4-5 top/bottom layers
0.2 layer height
0.26 first layer
3-4 perimeters 40% infill
*pulley
how do i support the gear and how do i insert my idler
im designing the geared part of my z axis
yes, will i also need a 1:5 gearing if im using a pancake stepper
Ill look at it
<@173827530929733632>. Yep both.
i think im gonna use herringbone gears (if i figure out how to design them) and have one be 5 times larger than the other wich would give me my geaing ratio then use a printed shaft to drive the z
i have everything else designed i just dont know if i need the gearing ratio, ill be using my second extruder slot for this z and evrything is reused parts from the printer
80 is defualt for marlin (dunno what klippers is)
i have klipper and for my belted z
if i need one, how would i implement it, room isnt a worry
do i need a gear ratio or can i just stick with 80 steps and no gearing
i have a spare 0.9 pancake stepper
Gn
, morning is about 10hrs from now so ill live stream my build and y'all can come on and critique if your bothered
Well a belted z isnt too much effort from that
Also will I need the vslot or just a belt, ive never seen a belted z
<@179670325351415808>. Can I ask, what setup are you going for on your printer
Thats only if it works and mines gonna be very, very, very poorly engineered
You're too kind
Will do
And its a easy project to do until the rest of my printer parts arrive (fecking t nuts)
Yep and I can use it either way because my current z has 400 steps per mm and a 1:5 also have 400 so I can repurpose or just have them synchronised
So once I get abl ill have better mesh leveling but until then ill have a cool party trick of a independent z
I have vslot wheels and extrusion and belts and motors so I can just huc it onto the printer and have a dual z, I also have another endstop
I have either a spare synced slot for z or a e2 slot to use
Dunno if it's a dumb idea but a vslot/ belted z (independent) that uses a 1:5 ratio
i'd say so too
also does frequency simulations
easy to use guide and they have pla, abs, pet as available materials
stress tests and all kinds of other stuff
free simulation website with 3000hrs simulation time for free
alright, non pwm then, cheers
alright, if i have a pwm fan can i make it work on a non pwm fan socket (just use the + and - leads) would that works
oi vey, sounds like im just using one 24 fan
yep ive got those ready to buy, is there any risk of them breaking, not pwm
im really inexpeirienced with electronics so what would you reccomend for least effort/money/expeirience
parralel would work better, no?
its dual pin if that helps
only 24v unfortanutly and same model fans
also should it be pwm for nah
or can i do 2 24v fans in parralel
alright well ill just get one 24v fan
hevacs, i could just use one but ya know 2 is better
hell nah, 5 quid per fan and next day shipping or 4 week shipping for 35 quid
could i put them in a parralel circuit and combine the 2 + and - wires (how would i combine wires0
i need 2 120mm fans and i have 1 controllable fan slot, so i need a way to combine the 2 and i figured 2 12v fans equaled 24v
is there any inexpensive (no cost) janky method to do it
how would i take 2 12v 3 pin fans and plug them into a 2 pin 24v plug
then it will be nice and steady without major changes
im gonna move the smooth rods to the front so its driven in the back and stabiliased in the front
oh well
hopefully he makes this into magic sauce for our printer
also is this fancy closed loop steppers or is it actually firmware based
is it feasible?
this looks pretty cool and if this reaslly is a miracle cure then i would love to have it on my printer
yeah they have a good spread of color and quite cheap (i got mine in red)
nice, i love their stuff, nice and rigid and good tolerance
√ºbersetzt mit google translate
Ich bin nicht der Entwickler, aber das klingt gro√üartig und die √úbersetzung von Deutsch nach Englisch hat gut funktioniert. Ich kann es kaum erwarten, Ihren Build zu sehen
dope
look at <#747889732481974403> and scroll up through this channel to seen some WIP photos
v2 is soon to be released (month or a few) but the v1 is alright, the v2 mostly gives more space and a belt tension system, it also is a bit lighter
yes, but no
and looks pretty snazzy
ill look at that later, cheers
whats a good average frequencyy for most belts
damn, much better than trimming belts and pulling tighter
bed mesh veiwer when it says my bed has a 2 cm dip in the middle and my bed is slanted up
beatiful
welp, here it is, a electronics case for the stock psu and wiring and the skr v1.4/turbo and my (specific) raspberry pi. it also has stepper driver cooling and a screen mount, im going to update the case to ride on 2020 extrusions using the default v-slot wheels
ill be live for a bit just designing my electronics case
Also for that build plate hes gonna have to buy his own hot bed made from aluminium or something
Full frame unless custom doesnt exist but plenty other machines have that build size
Anet a8 plus/max
damn
X idler nearly finished and everything else is in place. All thats left is rails, belts and electronics
darn
<@!173827530929733632>  ?
does anyone have a .stl for a mgn 12h block
would printed extrusions let me build stuff without needing any extra purchased hardware, my printed hardware tray will roll on extrusions but i dont want to buy more extrusions
yeah definitely see what he has to say
just a fyi not all of those need to be toothed and theres no ill effects from using a non toothed idler (its reccomended to go for a 50/50 split) but i think they should be exchanged and bought from one seller but i dont know if they would really do much different, you may just have a wee bit of extra belt wear
are they all the same spec
I'm just using A bowden. Direct drive has some benefits but it adds too much weight
if theyre the cheep ones
nice, make sure to clean and re-oil them
oh yeah, but veeerry entertaining
also that flying gas canister didnt look too good
<@!173827530929733632>  sn9 did a epic belly flop into the sand, over rotated and a peice fell off
the design opts for it just for extra stability on the rails (if theyre cheep they wont be the strongest) but if you dont need perfect dimensional quality and wanna reduce weight you may a swell not use one
im planning on a printed adapter/a short block of extrusion. but you can use a extrusion if you wanted
look through his channel, this one is surprisingly one of the best
ayyyy, nice, im just waiting for my tnuts, how are you doing hardware wise
dont want to high jack the operation, probably should have said 'my brother could make us a bot if we ever wanted one'
fair enough
fair enough, but can i ask why
Also we're gonna get a bot and serial numbers for everyone
Not bad for 1hr per part
is there a way to have some fans turn on when i turn the printer on that arent connected to my board or use usb power, i want cooling for my steppers
use tinkercad it takes 5m to make all of those or use dutchdues
or just the block length
do the circles need to move
i can make you a sick ass cube with circles on it
no, but i can do tinkercad
can you test using 4 microsteps (microsteps loose torque) and try using a free hanging mass dampener (a weight tied to your frame) to reduce vibrations
has anyone ran the blender bmw tests, if so what time would be considered mediocre
f
how does that 0.9 stepper compare btw?
i assume 65 is what it could do according to numbers but in real life it does 50
also do you know what speed 1000rpm would translate to
where the line is highest does that mean at 100rpm the torque is highest
the y is gf.cm
true, this is just torque
<@!179670325351415808>  is this what you were talking about for torque
the cad model should be out soon and will include voiced over animations of assembly
i think more toothed idler / more idlers and probably longer belts and different svrews
weird, ive never had any problems with my tl v6, even when it was tied on to my printer with string it printed better
smart, cheap parts from tl and the rest from a better supplier
makes sense
ahhh, theyre just behind in design
reviews*
weird, i have nothing but glowing reies for their hotends
isnt the trianglelabs version as good or better
most of what i want checked is just generic mistakes- for the pinout and all that im using example configs
unfortunately, no. but if i do my best to write one up (based of one of vorons pre made ones) could you give it a once over and make sure its good
im a complete noob at doing the config for klipper- can someone help me
jesus christ, you may as well do that for all the screws and sell exact kits for v2 (with all the other hardware)
0.68 per 100
yeah its cheaper for the normal kind anyways
cool, thanks
for tnuts*
this kind of block or the normal type
my friends expectations for my printer
and if its easy enough to print you could advertives hundreds of things then print on demand
its weird
yep
i see some going for 15+
honestly, ring doorbell buttons in stiff tpu
anywho i gtg now
and im only 150 in
yep- at least i set aside a good 500 just for this project
maybe ill magic up a way to do it
ahh- i guess im trying to stay nice and cheap while getting blazing fast speeds
what do you mean
but this build is still sub 300 so no complaints really
bruh, 20 quid for all fasteners and i still need to buy the motors (im probably just gonna stick with whats stock for now tho)
oh well, ill just grease it, lots and buy 8 just incase
would i need to edit the cad or is there room already
not between the idlers?
old version
yep
or is it 16
so 4 total
<@!173827530929733632>  i just need 2 for the front and 2 for the x idler, correct?
the current, ill by the new one once its fully come out since i havent even gotten close to done on v1
im gonna go for nylon but i dont know if i need the shims for precise leveling or just a set size washer <@!173827530929733632>
and should i get metl and use grease or get nylon/acetal and use no lube
which is better
thanks guys
<@!234475400313569280>  which screws from there
m3 m4 and m5
any
<@!173827530929733632>  i cant find any screws longer than 20mm
cool
for the v1 printer, is it m3/4/5 (for the washer and long screw on the idlers and tnuts for the front idlers)
guys- what screw type do i need for the tnuts and the screw and the washer
i cant access the link
and the 45mm m3 screw
are the washers i need m3 and the tnuts also m3
im using a 120mm fan (2) and the hevacs
no problem, i need a few more parts for my printer - i think just the tnuts and the washers and some 45mm m3 screws
oi vey- your prices are so inflated
also you can always return them if they arent suitable
also small motors are very powerful anyways
as long as torque is equal and amps are the same then go for the small ones
true but if the cost isnt massive then it makes sense to get rid extra failure points
wdym
high temp i assume means you wont need cooling for longer, so if the price difference is chumps change then you may aswell get it
neither can i, im just comparing it to what i have so im just gonna say bigger is better (apart from when its obviously not)
they are 10 for me
looks like the torque is higher
oh good, i have 2209s and i have 2 spare heatsinks
are you maxed out by temps or by the drivers
also <@!179670325351415808>  the degree wont matter too much since there will be 2 motors working together, effcetively upping the resolution, also 0.9 degree motors are worse for speed (i think)
are they good <@!178418959853289472>
also the weight is just a bonus, heavier objects need more force to shake so these just add reinforcement
beefiest motors i could find
<@173827530929733632> even so they can handle quite a bit so she highest torque possible motor is best and then run it below spec
Isnt speed based a lot on torque so you want to be able to have 2a stepper with the highest torque
bigd in mine ive used 3/4 inch pvc pipe and he ikea cube storage box
And the mgn 12h rails 300mm
Aluminium extrusion is the 2020 370mm
would just a block with captive nuts with similar sizing to a extrusion just screw in the same
could extrusions could be swapped for pla adapters to hold the linear rail (pla is most rigid as long as kept at low temps and the adapter gives less weight)
just did, looks dope
ill swap to yours
<@!173827530929733632>  would using a chamfer on everything touching the build plate (a tiny one)  help reduce any overextrusion and help with fitting
try a LACK enclosure
yep, everything extends off the printer now meaning more travel area is achevied
as far as i know it has a larger bed, lighter, belt tension, cleaner look, better design (more robust), cleaner look,but this is only in the early stages of development
v1 it is
fair enough
if i buy the parts for v2 would i be able to beta test in a sense, im not very fast at these projects so i wouldnt update the printer often
<@!173827530929733632>  im only going to receive some more parts for my v1 in 4 weeks, is it worth my buying them and building or should i wait for the v2 and order the hardware for that
nice, so in theory it makes it lighter, would infil in the opposing direction to your grid help stregthen it
<@!173827530929733632>  would printing grid infill with bigger line widths or multiple extrusion lines (both produce thicker lines) acheive the same effect
true
<@!234475400313569280>  have you seen the biqu h2 extruder
obvs i gotta share it (ill be attempting to use a hevacs as well) so i will probably just find another v6 mount and slap it into whatever is the current standard for this printer. so if my rail is on top of the extrusion i have the mount at 90 degrees and the belt clamp i have no clue
my mount will be no wider than i v6 so i assume ill have no grievances as long as i can align everything (i guess ill need to set some offsets) and the belts i can just *borrow* some parts from another mount to adapt to mine
looks like some washers are needed but that animation is *mwah*. although, do i need to use the afterburner or can i design my own mount (just the heatsink cooling and hotend mount )
nice, im gonna swap the extrusion for an adapter so that i dont need the extrusion but i can order some more tnuts and pulleys
will the amount of hardware change or is it the same hardware
yep, this v2 is looking like a massive step up
how do the motors move the belts
only 1 qeustion
just saw the v2 render, thats pretty smart routing the belts like that for the extra room
nice, thank god it shows all the hardware like that or else i would never be able to figure it out
honeycomb infill on a cylinder at both 200mm/s and 30mm/s
lgx/hemera competiror??
oh no, poor them
Key word- *visually*
the new extruder (especially the hf version) looks quite promising but i havent compared it to the sherpa
yes
my belts 38mm
just upgarde then takr the parts that you removed and make another stock ender 5
same (mine was 120 tho)
no its from any discrepancies in the leadscrew and can be caused by billions of things so generally its easier to use a belt driven z
and the belt adds much more torque and pretty much no banding
the build plate will woblle unless supported on 2+ sides
dual z will eliminate a lot of wobble and to reduce backlash you can get anti backlash nuts. it does improve for super fine layers and helps with getting better abl meshes
the bed if held from more than one point (not cantilevered) shouldn't wobble but if cantilevered it will
instead of having a leadscrew it uses a rail of sorts and a belt to rise and lower the bed, with a large gearing ratio you can get super fine movements and thats without microstepping. it also reduces all backlash if done well and doesn't require any greasing
if i buy a ptfe lined hotend from aliepress that costs 10 quid and just use a expensive nozzle, will i still get good quality since the only part of the hotend in contact with filament is the nozzle
also my pla sticks wayyyy more to my nozzle than any of my petg's
i just brush mine with a brass brush before a print
dayum, mines 1mm over my whle bed (but its a smooth gradient to my x is leveling to the bed now and i have variance of 0.3
PRETTY FLAT
true, theyre the apple of 3d pinters
i dislike duet. they're too expensive and you rely on their makers to make fw so if they discontinue it- you get screwed
yeah the gtr board looks like its meant to be a higher end skr boards for industrial or higher end hobbyist
true, i went for skr v1.4 turbo just because of the price (10) with a ton of discounts and shiz. but the board does look pretty nice
<@!179670325351415808>  it will work fine but with all the preexisting support i dont think i will migrate to the fystec board on the corexy. but i may get it later for my marlin printer
<@!178418959853289472>  cheers
its just less refined imo- but very budget
also <@!179670325351415808>  just lookded at the board- it looks like a cheaper (albeit slightly worse) version of the skr boards
quick question: does the skr v1.4 turbo use 4 pin connectros or the fans, or 2
sure but you dont need that many, 2 and a special bed is plenty for perfect level
use a kinematically mounted bed with dual z, should be more than enough
so the 3 mounts will have it level and bl touch will tram it
it uses gravity to hold it
the mounts would allow it to maintain its level always and it will never deform and keep perfectly level
yeah i gess ill figure it out with trial and error
but im printin currently at 40mm/s, im using the all metal hotend from microswiss
12mm/s cubed volumetric max
0.8
height=0.56 line width=0.96
<@!153256118473195520>  technically just a repeatable auto LEVEL not tramming, i would still use mesh bed leveling
<@!178418959853289472> i got 24.03?
yeah im just gonna ignore those 2 extra leadscrews
how to i convert my 12mm/s cubed volumetric feed rate to my top speed in a slicer
f
mine takes 5.....minutes to boot
i didnt undertsand the video much but if its lightweight then that looks like a dope idea
yes, you can insulate the bed but ijn some cases it makes it worse becuase it adds more thermal mass, so do it right ot not at all for insulation
its honestly very short and is just a tall prism its a flat cut so it probably cant be modified much but if i see any good change then ill keep working on it
it will use a 5015 fan with no optimization and 0 knowledge of how fan ducts work, so if this works, im fairly sure any system would work
im about to print a janky ass hevacs style duct fo my cr10- ill uplaod comparisons between my current (shoddy) cooling and the hevacs
<@!179670325351415808>  im not too iffy about noise and EXTREME performance but those arctic fans look very expensive for what they do, is there any reason not to go for the ones i found
If I use quiet fans and a badly optimised duct would it be much louder or still quite quiet
Or design my own good ones
Ahhh. So if I wanted a hevact I would need similar fans to his
these are cheaper and dual pin and the amazon one has higher cfm but they dont have pwm (whatever that is)
<@!179670325351415808>  would this fan (with a connector) www.amazon.co.uk/Neuftech-Cooler-Fan-Radiator-Airflow/dp/B00ZW15B6U/ref=pd_sbs_147_1/261-1604882-4747251?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00ZW15B6U&pd_rd_r=fb066751-3b1f-4051-9e89-b3485953b1e6&pd_rd_w=JOR0k&pd_rd_wg=Whez6&pf_rd_p=c1b0d6b0-0f46-4d06-b951-a1c184c4ce91&pf_rd_r=JY8KHPGGG4GJV0DYE6X7&psc=1&refRID=JY8KHPGGG4GJV0DYE6X7 work better than the ones you had
whats a pressure gradient do, could you not simulate that with ribbing or a fine mesh?
and the duct can stick out the side
the hevACS doesnt move it stays parallel to the bed at a fixed height
is there any reason for the hevACS  to pull air from the bottom, could it pull air from the side
ahh, when mine finally give out im going noctua
lol, i never replaced mine
lol, mines next to my bed because im lazy
quick PSA: joan fabrics is selling polaroid filament for 12 pounds- its not the strongest filament but is very pretty when printed
nice
yeah as the end will be sitting in a holder nothing will move over them (but try deburr
 them)
rails or rods?
<@!208332184031854593> it takes my 5s to get to 100 and 66s to get to 260
its like 8 pounds for a new 60w heater
15?!
dope, i could cut some glass to that size instead of my tiny 200x200 alum plate
sensor less just needs something to bump into
normal ones can be mounted facing up and use a lever to be depressed
it goes pretty high without the endstops but if not you can always go lower
you could add risers to the x axis or have a mount for the hemera that positions it higher
my god, *two* millimetres, it just wont fit. its too tall
and search the channel for the idlers
i can send you the buyer i used from aliexpress, 2 rails glide soooo smoothly after cleaning but ones smooth but not 'weightless'
nice to see the printer sill being updated, it inspires confidence in the future of the project
ahh, makes sense
the motor mounts look pretty thicc
yes but you would need to move the front rails becuase the carrige would collide with it, unless you lose z space and have it hand down
looks good, cant wait to get the new version
for example im using a rollout drawer that i printed that gives me plenty access and extra mounts for absolutely everything, wheres as some just used the stock box and a relocation
mainsailand+klipper is recommended but some people kept the stock board and some went for skr1.4 turbo with 2209's so electronics upgrades REALLY vary from user to user
ill be on in 9
try in cura setting max resolution to 0.01mm and using arc welder plugin for cura (and enable arc support in fw)
does anyone have the assembled model of the x axis, i want to make a adapter so that you dont need to use aluminum extrusions, it will have 2 trapped nuts to secure the rail and will reduce weight
what did you do
dope
ah cool
oh cool, thanks for the help (how come theres a few stls included with mounts in our github)
and should i not use the ones included in the zero g github
im not using a afterburner for now, i want to go for a bowden system
which stl need to be printed for the e3d v6
maybe if i designed and prototype it they would but i dont have the machinery
wish they would make this but i doubt it
so nozzle sizing doesn't change
BUT you would be locked in to a ecosystem  of heaters, but everything else would be standard (with the nozzle sitting flush to a peice of the top cover)
and no chance of jamming since theres no heatsink to heat up
what if you had a circular heater that slots in from the top with a screw-in top cover, the cover could be made from titanium alloy so it doesnt heat up and act as a heat break. you mount it straight to a dd extruder so you get a nice big heat block with a small travel and a easy solid mount
well, a lathe and someone who cares enough could machine a bigger better heat block
and the heat block isnt supported on the heatsink
yep and then no worries of wobble
yep, a dragon hi flow version is much better
and its a blinged up v6
and his decision of proprietary nozzles is questionable
the seller is very hostlie and doesnt give much proof of claims
it leans on groove mount (not a great idea)
nova
i wouldnt go for a ova
true but why add unnecessary weight, why not just the rail
cf rods will wear and release deadly dust, i beams are unneeded as a linear rail can be mounted without alum extrusions
<@!178418959853289472> mount the frame to something solid and make sure everything is solidly mounted with no dampeners and then mount that onto soemthing soft e.g foam
nice- i cant wait to get to his level of speed
at least nothing screws into them
no i dont think they are
but the matrix extruder has a hotend and etruder all in one so you wont need the bmg
the bmg is just a extruder, the hotend needs the fan but the mosquito hotend wont need as much cooling but if you are going for water cooling then the bmg is a good choice
the extruder only helps you push out different plastics and there's a new extruder from bondtech coming out that seems like it will work with the mosquito so i would wait for that- the hotend allows for higher temperatures or higher speeds so while you get the printer set up on the most basic level you don't want to deal with a bad hotend- as long as your printer is already tuned with your current setup it will be easier to tune after a new upgrade
the drivers are good and a good price
go for corexy, then board and klipper, then extruder, then hotend. make sure you buy assorted button head screws (m3,m4,m5 screws and nuts)
yup- i recommend getting 2209 they run cooler and have sensor less homing- its cheap enough to buy a new control board but if you skimp out on the board you can spend on getting klipper and mainsail working on a raspberry pi
cool- smarter than just yeeting everything together
yes, are you keeping the stock hotend. i would recommend the belts from trianglelabs as they're cheaper and better- the steppers dont need to be 0.9 degree as micro stepping will account for some accuracy so its a bit overkill (its not bad to have them but they aren't necessary). the linear rails will need some grease (and degreaser)
noice
ill eventually reprint them but for a couple months can i have them in pla
can the parts be printed in pla- im waiting for my all metal hotend to arrive
merry christmas
for mounting if i want to use a different mount designed for the blv, what would i need to print and change
good
im looking at the idlers and they have some holes that don't go all the way through, should thy or is it fine
welll, thats a weee bit too expensive
ah alright, steppers it is
are there any advantages to using this over a 2a stepper
these look like low cost servos for precise movement
all open air with spaced out mounting and 3d printed so i can never shorti t
using my old vslots to make a desk mounted roll out electronics case
just a fan and shroud should do it
oh boy 1cm layer heights here i come
sorry to butt in but can it be printed at any layer height
nicee. looks shiny and clean layer lines
dope
proper tungsten tooling parts last thousands of hours of milling steel, so your good
well theres an adapter pinned somewhere, community mods maybe, very recently, it has all you need
the filament path is shorter so its definately better
everything scales by a certain factor so find the factor and multiply 4m times X then boom belt length (give or take an extra meter just incase
not yet but you would only need to upscale yuor linear rails
cheers, ill send you mine if i do it first
noice, if you get this done before me would you send me your config
nice, im at the same point as you, im using a e3d v6 with klipper and skrv1.4- you?
and quality looks good, cant wait to print this
but not for this one right, im hoping to use them in another project
is there any part to keep from my ender 5, brackets and bearings and screws wise, apart from those keeping the frame sqaure
same as the voron afterburner build right
and is the x carriage mounting compatible with the blv mounting
cool, any eta or is this in limbo until its printed and tested, also when i get close to finishing the assembly of my printer i would be interested in the whole testing of new printer parts
does the hardware needed change or does it just add a few more parts
damn, new versions looking good
whaddaya mean dont run in linear mode, do you mean linear advance
if i buy a solid mount do i get the dragonfly or mosquito or draon
agh, expensive
if not i would asume the threaded heatsink is next best
does v6 allow rigid mount
ah, is groovy mount better
check it out, is there an easy way to mount this without changing a mount a ton
yes, but special
(input shaper uses vibrations from movements to cancel out previous vibrations to reduce ringing)
and for usability and universality marlin
at low speed, any, at high speed klipper
octoprint and klipper dont go togther, mainsail (i think) works better
klipper configuration, octoprint accessibility, marlin ease of use and reliability, PRICY
klipper is python, marlin is c++
marlin in reliable and rich in features, its good for sub 100mm/s printing and its easy, to configurate and to understand
its easy access to configs and its quiet
klipper is speed
well
abs+ from esun, little smell, no acetone smoothing, great color choice and no warping even after aiming a desk fan at it, if its not printing great a cardboard box does wonders
nice
if not a new board, whenver i get around to uploading my firmware for the ender 5, ill shoot it your way. youll have to enable sd support and change esteps and chamge the bed size but everything else is good
and the trianglelabs hotends (all metal ones) are really high quality, then a nice bmg 2.0 from trianglelabs is great, and if you feel like it a 32 bit board and corexy
well try looking at the ikea lack designs those are a good start
whats your aim for the printer, and how experienced would you say you are
ah, oh well
ah, cool, probably should have realized that, also would a nema 23 with a 1:2 gearing ratio give me better acceleration/speed
hi, ive broken a thermistor on my cr10s pro, i cant get it out even after undoing the screw, i think there's a grub screw holding it in or melted filament, i can either heat it up without runaway protection to momentarily pull it out but i have no clue how to disable the protection- anyone have a clue on how to fix it
im about to make my firmware, are there any parameters that are universal values for this printer
the channel is really blowing up, how come
Ding dong the Shane is gone
at least hes having a good time
oh well

Is it a pif equiv
The pod thing
Oh?
Fair enough
Its just a role with no extra perms called banned
No no, for a joke
Can we get a 'banned role' it just makes your name pink or something and thats it
Indeed, i have been promoted
Update me when its finished
And possibly adaptive extrusion but thats just a thing i read about a while back
Yup
Watch for skipping or underextrusion, sure the filament is there but is it moving at the requested speed

There might still be a few ;eft from thingiverse days
Lol, theres only 3 of those around that i know of
If its e5 compatible i can print and toss it in
You could gain more on the y if you went for unsupported rails
Z belt mods exist on ender 3s (try Google ender 3 belted z) and on voron 2.4 and a few other 3d printers
considering how non convoluted the e5 is thats a much better idea then the jigsaw peices i was gonna make around the z
@me when its up, also the panel would have to phase through some solid metal to be where it is, so howd you get the rods in the holes, unless you just lifted them and the leadscrew
<@525391334102532100>.
Those panels look sick, how'd you get them to fit so perfectly and how did you get then over the rods
Seriously tho. This looks awesome, if I ever convert to 2040 ill be using this
Aww shucks, ya makin me blush
Damn this looks soo good
Oh also try making sour candies with citric acid
Fair enough I just love the homemade ones. You can make them softer and sweeter
Havr you tried making marshmallows or honeycomb or fudge or a family favourite of peanutbutter chocloate balls (its just peanut butter and condensed milk coated in chocolate, very unhealthy but soo good)
To carbonate it you would need food grade dry ice (or a soda stream) but check out any traditional style recipes they'll probably be quite close
We can make a trade, you send me 500 bucks and ill send you a can, its a very good deal
Especially since the main brand has no sugar
Its surprisingly not too sweet in flavour imo
<@451709396280410132>. The flavour isn't very easy to describe. Best I can do is vanilla ice cream had a baby with soda water and sugar
Root beer is roughly 37p for a 2l bottle
They have all the best soda and its incredibly cheap
We have Barr and they sell it for 30p at the corner store or we can get aome other bran for ¬£1.20 so Barr is the best choice
i just have water and occasionally a cream soda or root/ginger beer
if i owned trianglelabs i would design my own hotend from whatever the hell annex says and make 80v drivers custom and sell wantai steppers (and a hardware kit for the merc)
if we are really dreaming, why buy from the factory when you can BE the factory
Cnckitchen has a video talking abour how surprised he was that they dont break
They hold up pretty well
What changed or how did you do it (just a short tldr)
Biggest I did was 410mm on a .6
also a belt path like that gives you a straighter belt path for much better movement
wdym
ah, thats a lot of effort
hes been there all day
whos the guy in vc
i dont have an arduino, i do have a old board tho
yeah thats what ill be using, i can use it to controll my stepper driver cooling and all my other fans
thanks for the tip
oh i could link my other board
is there a way to get more slots for thermistors or is it limited to 3
sorry turns out you need a min/max temp
how do i make my 2 new temp sensors show up on the temp graph
ill just tape it then
i wish
cool, solder or just tape
should i suater it to the bottom plate or to the heatsink
im going to be adding a temp sensor to my stepper motor
surprisingly not, if you can get the head through a spiral or if the tubing is loose enough you can just yank
pro tip, 10m of 12mm or 20mm spiral tubing or corrugated tubing is like 7 bucks and makes cables downright pleasant to look at
yeah you woudnt want to do that, but some particle board can be mounted easily for screws to go into
oh boy, guess ill be buying second hand or using cheaper boards
pretty nice, i may have to test that on the bottom of my desk
dang that looks good, reminds me of monster endergy cans
nice, actually seems like a pretty cool table overall, i may have to 'borrow' that idea
also is that table a custom repair job or did it come with the green pools
i think its this brand 
dude thats awsome
What's the chances
whats the ff
im waiting for trianglelabs to clone it
yeah, anyways a cheap extruder from trianglelabs and a bit of elbow grease will work as well as the lgx
yeah like the extruder is nice but is it ~that~ nice
im just waiting for triangle labs to make it for sub ¬£100
Why dont you use the corexy back plate? But also just put this .stl into meshmixer and use the inspector tool
very clean
theirs looks mildly miffed yours looks chuffed
lol is this your z belt idler
Phew. I thought there was already a mod for this and i had spent the last few days making a redundant version
wait is this a belted z mod for ender 5
dude i already sent you a screw in mod, bruh
just use the 2nd link i sent
yeah it is, or the second link wich is already made for the afterburner
just take his blouch mount and holes and huck them onto any afterburner back plate and bada bing bado BOOM, bltouch
easily adapted and hes talking about the back plate, the rest of the links specify just voron
or spend 5 minutes googling and find these(thingiverse.com/thing:1774738)
just use manual mesh bed leveling
you could make it strappon and only use during probing
well ive got nothing else then
well in the front im fairly certain you would just have to not use 2 screw holes and it would work
move the extrusion in the front that it would run into below the toolhead
ah, i suppose moving the front extrusion to be a bit lower and mounting it in front of the after burner would work
i think any bltouch mount will work as long as it replaces the current probe or doesnt add bulk
nvm
can ya do it real quick for me, ive had this going for a hour now#

can someone send me a stl, i need to make a gear but it wont render in openscad, if i send the .scad can someone render a 60T gear
and part cooling will be the hevacs- 2 120mm fans blowing air onto the part
the only mounted parts will be the hotend and its clip on cooling solution /adapter
yep, im pretty much only printing pla so im making the most bare-bones mount ever (plus reinforcement for rigidity)
oof
heres everything ive done since you sent me that, its just the adapter for a vertical rail to the thingy you made
ohh
tinkercad
yeah, im worried about my potato pc turning itself into a baked potato
ill give it a fiddle but my pc only runs it at 2-7fps
you're a life saver,thank you
its alright, i usually just mildly edit others files with tinker-cad and im pretty happy with that
thank you so much, i have veeeery basic experience so the f3d and stl would be nice but just f3d is good
could they be 4mm
pretty much, yeah, are the holes big enough for heat set inserts?
just need the groove  with countersunk screws and enough room for a heat set insert, ican send you their product page if you wanna give it a shot
unfortanutely, i dont have them
here it is btw
can someone help me recreate a mount, i just need the basic shape and screw holes can be added later (by me) i just cant create the basic shape, i just need the upper part
true]
but could you re use the y axis motor mounted inline with the smooth rods and move he belt to the end
looks pretty good
And everything else from dutchdude
A large glass sheet and glass cutter is always a safe bet. So is PEI on springsteel or my personal favourite (although ive only tried 3 plate types) buildtake and its knockoffs
But overall it required some mods to getv working and need  to be screwed down to prevent some residual bowing
The bottom texture imo is to die for so theres that
I have one and adhesion is iffy. Sometimes perfect and sometimes non-existent
Mine are for others it isnt
I think the middle one is but it varies
Ah forgot about this, i used a super long one at first and it went past a lot of high power wires and it wouldnt connect or would drop out, got a super short one with ferrule thingys, all good
Ahhh elitism
Dies that linkee video cover grounding everything
Same here my outlets are grounded too
Yeah no clue, sorry
Out of my paygrade, but when you run 50 lines above and below that line will it do the thing
Hm. And it's not from a set of movements
Why not run the gcdoe from the parts of the print that break it and check if its from that or a different issue
Ah I got t9 do that then
search quick connect or disconnect in the search bar and take a peruse
iirc
you could try whichever dutchdude decdeded on (also consult <@!451709396280410132>  he seemes to have made a good quick connect setup for his printer)
ah nah, i would just go to straight to xt60
ah, my calculator lied, or i typed it wrong
i havent had that problem since im fairly certain the crap chinese screws arent real metal, if youre really concerned try getting some nylon m4 screws
Or a hanging mass dampener
Try bricks in drawers for more weight
Make it as tight as possible to the frame (I'm cementing some screw on clamps to mine) and do multiple tiles if yoy must and put it on open cell foam
Simulating closed look or actual closed loop would be better
Ah I see
If I tune it right I could get it to detect the second it skips then re run the last line of gcode. But I neither have the skill or knowledge to do that. This was a more hypothetical of could this happen instead of how do i
ah that wouldn't be great for the processor either i suppose, like kicking out someones knees and sending them on a marathon
Can I use sensorless homing on a extruder to detect jams or clogs. It would have to constantly be checking for skipped steps and would probably need extensive tuning. But would be pretty cool if it worked
talk to <@!244874310592757771>  hes got the first e5+ conversion
auto i think
same step, one wont be 1/16th through a step and the other 3/16th of a step
dunk the thermistor in boiling water to check its accuray
yeah its great that it exists but its way overpriced, good on them for having a product but theres no way machining costs that much
aliexpress will fix that right up
holy shit, thats huge, and that nozle looks fairly cool wich is good
i couldnt find a image, could you link one
and rigid mount
oooo, thats much better
True, they just have the highest flow
that or nova seems best, hf dragon has really good performance but bear in mind, none of these will upgrade your quality per se its more of a way to allow for higher speeds
well for highest flow you canyt beat a super volcano, but the best is somewhere between a dragon, mosquito clone, volcano or the nova
Ahhh. Nice
How?
Reduces lever action on nozzle wich nakes it sturier
Reduces distance in between nozzle and linear path
Mount the rail at the top and have the motor mounted at the top too
Is either better or just different
is there a differnce bewteen the trianglelabs t-volcano nozzle and the volcano nozzle
but make sure its protected and taped on with stress releif
Or get one without a glass bead and tape it with kapton tape
A higher temp thermal paste or a tight fit hole, e g how a v6 thermistor works
as long as its rated up  to ~100 degrees
sure
looks good
ah yes, prosthetic
psh my printed rails only require a few kilos of force to move, they're pretty much as good as misumi
but avoid the threaded stuff, they wont move smoothly and the threads will catch, i think the pulley is just for linear motion so yes
yepper
using 5mm shafdt instead of 8 as a place holder
but 3d printed if you want
equivalent of a washer at each end with a 5mm hole
youll be fine as long as its linear motion is smooth
add a adapter at the top and bottom that add a 5mm hole that slots over the pulley
thank god, just print a adapter from 8mm to 5mm and apply grease. just ensure its cut flat
you mean as a endstop not instead of a leadscrew
wait
they have bad tolerance, hard to lubricate, wear easily and are going to be a pain to use
no
no
no
please no
yeah its pretty cool, im probably gonna go a little overboard with speed
hell yeh
oh boy! do I?
looks like its volumetric flow is gonna be really high, and you dont need to hot tighten it but one handed / quick swaps arent feasible
yeah if someone trys them ill buy a few for my printer
in a v6 formfactor
youll have a clean hotend and the acetone will evaporate leaving the hotend clean
very nice, try straining that acetone then leave it for a few hours without topping it up, just make sure the hotend isnt touching the bottom
and buy whatever drivers you want
e.g stepper ports or controllable ports
just find a board with all the ports you want
any board is ok since we run klipper
very nice
but not fully
its gonna mostly dissolve
The cheap stuff wont dissolve at all or will take 1-2 days
But is it expensive abs
Ahhh if it's abs then yah its gotta be acetone
then heat it up to 140 and make some snips around the parts that are fully uncased, then cool it and heat it again while applying constant downwards force and if it doesnt yeild and pull off cleanly it either got too hot or the snips werent deep enough
just heat it to ~235 and slowly pull down as it heats while supporting the wires
ive had ones the size of my fist
oh thats not too bad
that looks fun
true, may aswell ask tho
if someone just wants to go through some scraps then the only cost would be shipping
ahh
otherwise the voron discord probably has someone in your locale with a cnc
also, why would you need a metal one
its 15 GBP for me and free shipping
<@!173827530929733632>  i found a all metal bmg with a metal gear but no individual gear
whos it from
uh, maybe?
so ive landed on the afturberner in bowden for my print head, which .stls do i need to print
uh if you wanna design something advanced, no, something simple, yes
could i reuse the stock mainboard with klipper to use a 4 motor z or automate stuff on the printer (as well as my new one)
my tnuts arent even here, at least my heat set inserts are here
bruhhhhhh, nvm my package that arrived was the only things i didnt need to finish the build
nice
oh ok, i thought there was gonna be more effort involved
i think i just install klipper normally and paste this in using octoprint (or whatever the recommended equivalent is)
does anyone have a config for klipper on a skr v1.4 turbo and tmc2209s
hippity hoppity that's now my property
make sure its close to the bed and that you have a metal base and you should be good
although if its inductive you need a metal bed for sensing (p.s the sens has good repeatability and its only limiting factor is user error)
yep
would the cost of my steppers indicate that they are worse even if their specs are the same
nice. seems like a good idea then
im looking at some other designs and a few have linear rails sitting unsupported, is there a reason not to cut enough aluminum extrusion to mount the rail and then have the rest unsupported. also would having 2 motors per axis (4 total) 2 running in parallel give me better acceleration and moving power, also is anyone using input shaper
well with my last test of 300000mbps i would get 0.01466666666 second downloads
yay
ay?
with my cheap parts ill spend enough time oiling and greasing all my parts i just hope its a piece of cake to build
solid, well I'm about to buy all the parts i need and when they arrive ill probably be back for help and eventually, a finished build
cool, im looking at your x axis and don't see any belts going to the hotend, am i missing something or is it partially assembled
any advantages to using toothed because smooth ones are cheaper, and i assume the blv hotend refers to a mounting system/standard
cool
and the link you sent, i only need 2 right
alright, I'm gonna pick some of those up, the ones on my printer are mounted to smooth rods and a bit to big
oh yeah, there's multiple choices of types, but regardless of size they look usable, right?
nice, these look like they'll work- 
smooth or all toothed or a mix
can i ask how many smooth idlers and toothed idler i need and will i need any that connect to the steppers or do i use the ones from a ender  5
sorry i didn't respond sooner, didn't see your message
i recall seeing a comment that the printer is compatible with the blv mgn printer mounting systems so i figured if there weren't any mounts for the hotend i could use this one-
yeah im using a knockoff e3d v6
thank you
sorry to bug you but the rails are 350mm on y and 300 on x, right?
cheers, the parts i need, where do i find them
an where can i access the BOM and .stl i need to build this
hi, is this a mod to the ender 5 or a deconstructed and improved ender 5
found that out the hard way
ive done that, donno if it really helped or if its just placebo, ill do some actual testing on my e5 (as best i can) with rigid and flexible couplings
hes just twanging the leadscrew, i dont think thats during actual movement
nah 5 buck for a complete overhaul for 4 leadscrews (plus some left over bits for other projects)
but assuming quality items its overkill
because cheap crooked af leadscrews are cheap
wont that introduce slop and wouldn't this be better - 
looks like i move the mounting holes to near the motor and then installl it in the stock location, ill see how much parts cost and see what results you get
also is that motor mount compatible with stock z
ah, ill buy some, does it matter if i get some cheap ones vs expensive ones
uh oh
cause mines rock solid
wait, are couplers meant to do that
hahahahahahahah
oh right you couldnt stop it from rotating and allow it to move, i guess your solution and 'wobble wings' are best
dim question i think but why not have the motor contrained in z and rotationally but not too much in x and y so any wobble shakes the motor instead of the bed
Congrats
Nearly enough for a serial
the biggest change is if you make acc 40,000 and top speed 180mm/s. then you get a line of near constant speed (except for 0.6mm of acceleration)
top speed will be held for a distance of 6mm for 10k and 7.3mm for 13k
over 10mm (middle of the x on the cali cube) 13k gives top speed in the first 1.6mm and 10k gives it in the first 2mm
thats over 50mm
looking at the prusa calculator shows the top speed will be hit in the first 5mm. 13,00 does it in the first 2mm and 10,000 does it in the first 3-4mm
<@173827530929733632>
True American health food
And the first layer is perfect, and since I swapped to my old textured build plate and im using silk pla its as shiny as glass but really "professional" looking
Shiny asf
<@173827530929733632>. Thanks for the help I just got a suuper clean print off the printer
any st belted z addon can be easily adapted to give you a triple z, the biggest problem is stepper ports
uh oh, mines a 5:1 gear ratio on a pancake stepper
damn looks pretty beefy, does it need to be that 'torque-y'
as long as you can do it, iw ould say go for it
also v2 isnt quite out yet
in theory, you could, but it will require modifaction of the machine or of the cad
broke down grease without rusting it and then evaporated leaving some gunk at the bottom of my cup and a clean bearing
I soaked mine in acetone then in grease for a day
Is there a special technique I'm missing
Its just a wire stripper but I can never get such clean cuts
check out yoyi pla and if theres the option for it, go for the old style if not dont bother with their filsment (its usually ¬£14 and its really nice stuff)
try a larger nozzle, same layergeight and slighlty bigger line width but less shells to save more time
dayum, clean
very nice
those look like the same rails i bought
im using the v2 lack and a storage cube that fits 40+ spools
no
same exact settings?
whats the room/hall near the printer like
spray on the abs with a squirt bottle  in a fine mist i supposse
Or insulation propped against it
Even a plastic bag
Nah mines just cardboard and its fine
I wouldnt reccomend it but you could do it as a stopgap
In enclosure
Ive got a full pla corexy
For cheap abs theres a 3 for 2 deal on e-da abs making 3kg cost ¬£14
is it brass
quite solid too?
are those yellow and stiff under the foil
easiest prvention is a airtight enclosure
cardboard require more than 500 degrees to ignite but a flame will light ot quick
well preventing fires that are bare flames vs high temp is very different
look for skips in your area, im watching one with some labelled thicc glass next to it, as soon as the work ends im taking that glass (with permision)
its good but a dd is better
yep
Plus the nozzle wobbles much more since ya know, levers
Bad quality with other hotends matching it
wat a shame
also try windex/window cleaner and lower the nozzle 0.04
lower nozzle, abs is much easier when the nozzle is a bit too low
bruh no ones gonna mention the fact i suggested boiling explosive acetone fumes and lighting a bare flame to combat a bad smell
especially both at the same time
i hear boiling acetone and burning incense really helps remove the smell
but not most recyled
true
abs is very environmentally friendly, its the most recycled platic
i think polycarb sheets work really well or glass
nice, ill dm i i can find a goood stl
But maybe the other colors would work
Alright, so I may use plaster and the 16g of black filament. Or ill suck up the price
Ill pay shipping plus filament cost
As long as I can print it black and relatively matte its good
80g at most, just a wing mirror cap
Too expensive for the few meters I need
Its for a wing mirror backplate
Does anyone in the UK have a uv resistant black filament that I could 'borrow'. I can tell you how much I need and pay fir that / shipping
Its easier
and they said it was a batch problem so probably a issue with the resin not the inherent material
I really overestimated its resistance
Never mind
Oh
Petg is good til 90 ish but with headroom 70. So I dony think your gonna get above that temp. Easiest way to find out though Is print a long shaft and leave it under tension for a week. If it moves then maybe avoid it but if not it's probably fine
Cf anything will warp less and print better
titanx i guess or abs+ neither is asa but they print as easily with similar strength, btw anything with carbon fiber will print better and more rigidly its just more abrasive
yeah but its a good step forward
looks pretty snazzy
whait, why dont people print in actual ovens
btw the pom from hobbyking is quite good (and cheap)
Cheerz
The print looks pretty good, my only qualm is the top layer looks slightly under exruded
You mind linking the guide, haven't seen that one
eww literal dog w3ater stinky poo
Weird I was sure it was much easier from when I used it
That is insanely smooth
Wow
get gud
ewww so lumpy
Damn, thats humonguos
idk looks kinda untuned to me
Fairs
Can i enter
Oh this hurts
K3 now
Uh oh
When I get home you will repent and marvel at my fairly good 3d printing skill
Woww
Well. Perhaps I should whip out some of my good prints
I will forever be pinged with images of perfect prints won't I
Fair enough. I prefer it
Cheapest you can source?9
Cases
Ah cool, that was why I suggested the change. White is also notoriously weird in skme. Ases
White does have lots of dyes on it so it may not flow very well
When you say better do you mean in visibility or flow characteristic
Try with no infill next
The bottom lighting helps exacerbate the wobble
Can you print in a darker colour and shine a light up from the bottom, it helps show off the z wobble or extrusion problems
Check the inside of the extruder, mine was clogged up with dust and needed a good clean and re lube
Its all lies and deceit
That's just a renderes image
Nah
'Decent' dude post that in the 3d printing sub reddit and be hailed a God for your tuning
Damn. I gotta get tuning
Iirc its only on ps and ss is yet to implement ir
Doggers
theres very little torque dropoff and all you gain is better print resolution
ah that does look better
trry a single top line that goes at 90 degrees at .3mm line width
We couldve kept vaguely misunderstanding anf answering your questions
Shouldnt have told him
Dang it
but yeah that plastic could also be remelted into legos and other toys
well, meat filament wouldnt be terrible
well hands are usually for holding stuff or manipulating object
its not a rip off if its well made or really strong, but otherwise a good abs is maximum 50 and 0.8x50 is 40 so time and plastic should be sub 200 unless it comes preassembles/sanded
plastic, unless you mean the thing beneath it. thats a hand
dang, thats so expensive for a maximum of ¬£100, especially since most of the effort is in slicing and pre steup
i see why it took 800g
banana for scale?
no, some extruders like bmg have less teeth on their gears wich leave a smal bulge on prints as they turn, so the lgx wich has finer teeth should have less of these
Try printing a really slow (60 or 70 mm/s) cylinder and check that the perimeter appears completely cylindrical
combing on all and use coasting or pa, also more flow
and cold pull
try upping your flow by a few percent
get a nice copper one or a hardened steel one and away you go
no really tho, get .8/1mm and never worry about filled or cheap filaments or clogs again
HATH SOMEONE MENTIONED.....LARGE NOZZLES
my 0.8mm nozzle sometimes looks smoother than a .4 without the one top layer
only for one top layer, it really smooths evrything out
try thinner line width on top and a single top layer going at 90 degrees
OH mY GoD itS so GOod, WOW, hoW'd yoU DO It
Why not the automatic balls that explode to put out fires. Have a couple around the room incase fire spreads and then have a light weight extinguisher near the printer
Lol mines in my linen closet or in the kitchen
looking good
nice, then the only other way to see print problems is a light and translucent filament, otherwise i cant see any problems
Shine a light from the bottom upwards to check for z wobble and if you have translucent filament it will show all imperfections
Lol
true

Huh one of my songs said I was missing chroma
Can I get chromalite on 1.13.2 I recall having it on 1.12 dunno if its still around
kk
lemme try restart
theyre both installed
lemme check
codegen is working too, its instyalled and enabled
nah it looks enabled, i even disabled and reenabled
nah they arent, just checked and practice plus isnt working so i assume the others arent too
how
oh
they appear installed and enabled although greyed oit
any way to verify my mods are working, it looks stock to me (i have a song installed so bmbf did work) but i dont see any sign of mods
also is the tutorial the weird one or normal one
thanks for the help
ah cool
code gen wont enable, i click the slider and it just disables itswlf
every other mod is fine (also theyre all dark grey is that bad)
has anyone tested the newest version of srmp
its all good, we just deleted the save files in the multiplayer mod
me and my friend are on the same world but i cant see any of our ranched slimes or upgrades to the corrals
id like to send my save game to my friend while im away so he can keep playing without me. are these the two files he needs
where there should be 5+ slimes he sees 1
we got onto the same world, but we cant see eachother and the worlds dont match up
would the registry fixes cause it?
we bith also get this error
[SRMP][19:35:43] Console Started
[ERROR] Failed to get command line argument 'AUTH_PASSWORD'.
both of us restarted the game
same error, only are the multiplayer mod and srml registry fixes
or he has an extra?
so would it be one of those is incompatible
i sent him all the dlls i have
we have identical mods
both in the same coutntry, both with identical mods

does that moniteor have a good OSD for settings
gotta give this monitor ti my little brother with its accompanying rig
also im mainly gonna be vr'ing on this rig
currently got a iyama 75hz 1080p 24" screen that my wschool dumped
when i get more moolah ill get a dual monitor setup
yeah ill stick to 1080p
what if i buy used
is there a visible difference?
ive recently bought a pc with a 43060ti and need a 1080p monitor to accompany it, id like a 120hz+ ips display curved or not it doesnt matter and preferably under 150 GBP. ive found a few already if you wanna see them or not
or use a angle grinder
put it in a drill and get a dremel or hand saw and have at it
oh hey, ive got one of those
yeah

üòÇ
Is it even possible to short a usb c by inserting it wrong
Not even to turn it off ü•∫ü•∫
I assume they mean the teeeeny bit of those glass beads thermistors that peak out from the insulation but are probably enamel wire
"I have never seen anyone being so incompetent to plug a USB-C cable. The cable goes straight in, in a single push, all the way. You move it side to side like you are trying to see if you can short the pins by inserting it at an angle."
"Did you have the power on while you changed the nozzle?

You aren't supposed to do that for a very good reason. There are often exposed bits of wire on the heater element and on the heat sensor. If you accidently touch those wires with a metal tool you send 24 volts into a chip that can only handle 5 and that's it for your board, and it's not hard to do what while you are changing a nozzle. 

The correct procedure is to heat the nozzle, shut off the power, then quickly change the nozzle."
Omg the Reddit comments on the post I put in <#708400201416704061>

fair enough, but its maybe 3 quid on ali for some questionable flux
yup, hard to save a bad connection when solder isnt sticking, fux just magics it away. i wont pretend im good at soldering, but i just slther flux on and go at it
just flux makes everythin better, slap it on, re melt and fixed
ah the rest is good
i know everyone says it but itll make the difference. im using some 6 quid alix soldering kit and my soldering is passable
get flux, ive got some really crappy cheap stuff and just solder by the window with a fan on
i cant solder for shit but flux just pulls it all together
got flux?
so the second it leaves th nozzle itll clog
solder solidifys very quickly right
<@216959009163313152> does that umbilical attach to th toolhead or just for running cables through the printer?
just meant to be a question
oopsie
are the wantai 42BYGHW811  any good. 6 quid on aliex?
and for my printer, being on a tight schedule is also a good case fopr layer shifting, stringing and clogs
Could you make only half of it threaded and print with the non threaded side down?
Or is it just a bolt
What's the inside of that look like
Eh just use your hand and bend it back
Yeah, so two DC motors and 1x1m of sheet metal. That's clear
Wat did you ask for <@186469468745105408>
<@262357679329116163> thats sick. i love how it looks. especially with that screen there
or that
yeah id get a pen an paper and a pair of these 
that guy just sucks
i think anyone reading a 100 page document would appreciate clean writing
You could try that and then try using the toolchanger
<@919487981860048977> there's websites that take your handwriting and turn it into a font
By that's probably a 2m+ peice
Well, on a much larger scale. As seen in Michael reeves surgery robot video there's quite a bit of flex in alum extrusions
3d print it with the bozzle nozzle <:thinkgun:665335072634699808>
uh oh
dId YoU tRy A cOlD pUlL
or did it get smushed
was the nozzle always closed up
There's his dicord
I think you set it in slicer
Does it need to be soft?
Use 60 grit
I made a inverted sanding drum for mine
Drv8825 and HV
awsome
<@826460928261226517> how much clearance in z is there between printed parts and those fans
That's what they all say
Awesome , I've been meaning to design a mount, unfortunately I'm not great at CAD. Once you've mounted it would you mind sending some photos
<@826460928261226517> what printer is that for
Just googled sideways metal drill and found them
<@195286997240250368> drill saw
I'm just gonna use a carbide cutter and a Dremel. But I should probably buy one of those
Yup
But only in one direction
How do I widen a hole
Oh mb, saw it over on vzbot
Also means you can run aggressive external cooling on every layer without worrying about cooling the bed
But it rather should just touch the bottom of the block and go right past
I had mine wrapped around and on the hotblock
Yup, I got it now
straight on from the back please
<@558976020317732874>  read the latest set of messages in <#708400201416704061>
Could you get a pic of the outside
Cool
Is it one continuous peuce or multiple
I'm having a hard time visualizing
Sorry, do you mind sending a photo of it installed
So I'm trying it out now/tomorrow, do you have any more closer photos or a slightly more detailed guide
I might give that a try
Cool
<@826460928261226517>  what is that material
I don't mind having nasty wiring as long as it's organized. If all the steppers are in a channel and all the power is in another section
Is flukz single?
mallet?
how do you manually adjust  a skip
<@186469468745105408>  where's that filmed?
I suppose if you scaled it up it would fit but for now just a nice electronics display case
Not quite big enough for a 3d printer
Fancy electronics case
And eventually just display case
Nah biggo electronics display case
glad i didnt buy one then
Are the replacement parts cheap and you just haven't got round to it or is it all round not worth the effort, time and money
<@251220159069421568>  what did the filastruder do to deserve being put with a ultimaker
in my class (high school so far less serious) people just talk quietly or whip out a phone
Oh sick, that makes sense
<@120380791506075650>  why so many spare? Do you loose them, do they die, do you need them for fast swaps?
And easily visible because it's license compliant and fully allowed
Ah I see it noe
<@696804720873963611>  what's the familiar bit?
Ps doesn't have top layer flow
Flow control per feature I think
And now I wanna climb inside
Have you ever seen those cyclone simulator machines, the tall deltas look really similar
I used to think 3000mm/s  accel and 60mm/s speed was lightning
Theyre fairly small
Have you seen the fdl 3/ fdl basic
Can't find the STL but the woozi might be small enough
EVA ?
gunk in every bearing
same wit my school, bought a ultimaker 3 then puts it uncovered in a wood shop
you live and learn
welp
oh yeah, probably shouldve been a little less specific
very long story but i personally dont have a ton of money. the headset was cheaper to buy than rent fir a party so i inherited it from that. the pc i saved for for 3 years and now i gotta get some games
fun stuff
-3 here
No, recently switched to PS and it's much better. Print quality and usability. Only 1 or 2 features I miss and they were QOL
smh
<@!919487981860048977>  they arent even all the same
100k
ah, just radiant heat melting everything
also what kind of machine hits 290c chamber temps
i assume its marketed as high temp so people buy it believing its fancy only for the actual high temp users to have it break
With a 100W uv flashlight anything can glow brightly /s
ah its alright it was only 9 different types of screws, i just had my mom help me sort them out
this is just pulled from a friend, they ended up getting a full refund plus 40% off next order
<@!232271799541301248>  what on earth are you using all the y space for ‚ÅâÔ∏è
Kinda like they were made with injection molding or sls
<@120380791506075650>  those walls look unreal
<@!425363617685438490>  off topic but something about that photo is really pleasing
beautiful
<@120380791506075650> , got a banana for scale on there
<:soontm:745268745269805097>
Perfect overhangs with less changes
It's petg all around but one layer of hips touches the other petg
Ohh thought you were printing hips with petg support
why
hm
looks fine to me chief
<@!206174225621319680>  why you just sitting in a parking lot
True
And make a cool bottom of the print
I wonder if a fine grid shape in the metal (as in economic as it would be) will increase grip
<@360421783863820298>  if I wanted to buy some assuming shipping isn't stupid, would I be  able to or does company policy make that a big no-no
Damn that's awsome
Ohhh I misunderstood what lab meant. I thought it was like a school lab, not one where you build and test motors
what happens to all those, seems awfully wasteful
<@360421783863820298>  where's all that 'scrap' from
or if you really arent in the mood, a drill to get it thin enough to pull out
damn, next option is to melt it and use some glue to get it out
got a photo
what isnt moving?
if its abs just use some acetone if its anything else use a soldering iron to melt it or heat a wrench
plastic iside the grub screw?
Good price. Questionable quality
Gotta vent the enclosure straight into your mouth for the fun times
They sell 13 dollars per kg iirc
Hobbyking sells POM at a stupid low price, doubting it's quality tho
and chicks dig scars anyways
that driver looks fne to me, maybe a little overseasoned but expeirience guves you character
oopsie, didnt see the writing
<@192355339721506816> not to be a party pooper but, are those the drivers that inevitably explode
Do you get chromatic aberration
How buggered are your eyes
kewl
I might need to start printing frame spares
<@111675640612151296>  printed lens or frame?
as long as shipping to florida isnt bad
ill take it
4 USD take it or leave it
boy do i have a solution for you, you want that filament out the house, eh?
are you in the us?
whsats thge project <@!251220159069421568>
a ring magnet and black magic
iirc theyre quieter and smaller and more efficient
its thin fibers of something iirc or a pearlescent powder but im not sre
i think its a saphire something, or custom
Wiiiiiiiiiide
is that for boron nitride paste removal?
mk3s
yup
waiting on slowmode
ill send a 2nd pic in a few mins
its someones melted hotblock
snapped a cheap nozzle like this
i can print fine up to ~265 with a microswiss heatsink which can be got for 3 gbp and a volcano including new wiring is 2 gbp and the genuine heatbreak is roughly 5 gbp. so for a brass nozzle and 40w heater and whatever the heatbreak microswiss sends you get a mediocre high-ish temp hotend that rarely clogs and can pump out filament for a large printer
i have a similar setup except its a cr10s pro all metal microswiss with colcano and it doesnt clog, dunno efficiency but it works
thank god my friend runs a phone repair shop and is willing to stick it back down for free
its only fallen off since my little brother took off the tape over the front of the screen, even after being told not too
ah my bad
cooked rice or raw rice, ive only tried the cooked kind
he cut too short so printed a v slot and screwed it onto the frame
<@!131888315866677248>  you joke desperate times, but my friends y axis is half printed v slot
skr pro works
instead of away from the board
i think any board where the drivers face sideays
Boards
It's a shame the powerbbrr only works on a few boars though
For something more professional but still low-key and for btt boards. Check out @ maze#0042's PowerBrrr
Ah so i should replace mine with a lower voltage cap
Tried a quick google but to no avail, whats that mean?
Ah cool, that should be plenty then
Theoretically Will my 400V 100uF caps be alright
I need more sleep
Oh christ
<@!206174225621319680>  for a second i thought that was the x-y motion not an extruder and laughed at the puny speeds
Oh I know just saying it's not firsthand experience
But the rp2040 is the highest step rate mcu supported (from what ive read)
Nah iirc its one per board and its at least 2 drivers per board
The super nova high voltage board
Lucky, what country?
Modt stuff arrives quickly but ive had items take upwards of 5 months before arriving
Im just gonna make an order from aliexpress, no need to watch notifications since shipping will take a few months and arrive just in time for my build
Ah cool
Did everyone order those pi's in a group or just coincidence
some of it, i bought the shell and gearset from them
well, ive gone through a kilo of filament and theyre fine so far, worst that happened was when they were too loose and filled the entire extruder with filament dust but some water fixed that. but the gears themselves are tl ones (same as the shell) but everything else is some cheapo knooff
spent 10  bucks on my bmg with a full spare shell and gear set
aliexpress is where its at
ah cool, otherwise similar quality?
<@!120380791506075650>  is there much of a difference in the profile of the filament grippy bit or machining on the cylinder or sharpness of the gears or really many differences. the biggest differnce i can see is the new ones are shinier and have a shorter teeth area thing

its a play on the joke because the second chemist doesnt use the chemical formula and says "also" instead of "too"
in English the joke goes
2 chemists walk into a bar
the first chemist says ill have a cup of h20
the second says ill have a cup of h20 too (when spoken sounds like h202)
joke is he meant to get a cup of water too but got given hydrogen peroxide

good god
me with my lights
most of mine werent dischraged below 3.2v so perfectly safe
but if you want to power a small device theyre alright
so no use in flashlights
theyre easy to remove but they dont have large contact pads
usually close to 14500

oh phew
Sorry to ask but, died laughing or died died
cool stuff
ahh
Or they just cover the fix with tape
it's just a cover? So whatever was wrong wasn't to do with the tape
Cause I've seen that a couple times on planes
Is that tape stuff permanent
Plus it feels safer
I'd rather that then a half fix

hey thats like 48v but the elctricity accelerates faster
entire house is 240v <:thinksmart:665708349035249705>
i saw someone mention you can remove the insulation on every wire to the hotend and twist it into a thicc copper wire, will that be ok
at this point may aswell do 40 guage
ah 32
i can do 28
ya know bigger number, bigger wire
ive wired it with 24 guage wire since that should be thicker than 16 guage
and what about this
one big square over the fan should work
alright, well ill vinyl wrap the whole thing instead
and ive got this 12v 60W heater but my printer is 48V can i just feed that to the heater
hm well i can settle for that. the watercolours are fine though, right?
can i dip it in watercolour paint
a see, i was hoping for a purple colour
thats fair, so noctua is the brand i should get
would 100 cfm be more suitable
this fan is 70cfm
ah my bad
but now the printer is broken
reddit told me to get a sunon fan so here it is
can somone help, got this new fan and for my all metal carriage and the printer keeps sending a heating error, something about unexpected heat drops

Just more or less than: 1/2/3/4/5 months
Do you have a rough time for when pc beaat together will come out (it's cross version and cross platform right)
We're all cross platform, this'll be the first time on a while we can br on the latest version and okay together

Although i am a tiny wristed teen
Thickest:69mm/ 74.8mm
Thinnest: 55mm/37.09
I've got 4 walls no infill and supports with .36mm layer height est 28hrs
How long did it take
To everyone who printed a Mando helmet
Then print it after homing it
He can also find the layer in the code and remove everything before it
You sure
Y'all wanna see something cool I built
did a sneaky lil delid

when i click the download this happens
could someone help me with steam unlocked

Ah alright
And get a port error <@!355936112423862284>
Will it suffice
Can I use klipperscreen over vnc
Made this today

My mum must've got it then
Ciol
ran out of time
nah
not the research
have you done the sciences?
cool, thats fine
nop
hello
No need of its a checked bag
Oh then it can go as one unit
In a backpack
Then put both in the sock
No checked bag?
That's what I do. I have all 3 lights with me
Just put it in a checked bag if you can
Or 
Take out the battery and stick it together with the flashlight in a backpack
The black coating
Any checked bags?
Also to protect the anodisation use a sock to carry it in
Just take out the battery
No flashlight
Which do you have
Yeah should do
Can't phone rn
Imma bring in some of the holiday hw and try do it tmrw
Yeah
Can I do it tmrw. I'm going to bed now
800m of throw with 6k lumens
this light
I'll try it tmrw maybe
Y sketchy
Nicd
Also
Did you verify them all?
is it much harder?
cool
dont think i would take it anyways

lets you use 18650s in a 21700 batt tube
its a adapter for 18650---->21700 battery size
do you need to buy a battery
also the shoes are size 10
nice
hows sports day?
nice
much colder imo looks bad
the sc31 pro is closer to 4000K
its a very warm beam 3500K iirc
the really wide one
have you seen my s21d
itll be kinda bluey
nah
why not the website?
4000K is more nuetral. and 6500K will look blueish
warmer light looks nicer
BUT
colder light is generally BRIGHTER
colour temp
much more expensive
oh rip
38 quid isnt bad fro a battery incuded bundle
judt buy it while its on flash sale
nopr
but not worth it
and yu can get aux LEDS+xpl-hi leds
the other features are nice
yeh nvm
altho no charging
700 extra lumens
one sec
wait nvm
moar lumens/leds

Yeah it's a good choice
One sec
Thought we were on the ts21 still
That's the if25a
Oh my bd
Marginally brighter, much more Stepdown, much larger size. No thanks
Look at the review by zeroair. A lot of step down
It's dimmer than the sc31
It's all sc31pro
Ye
Buying a dedicated charger
It's got all the different modes and settings
Anduril is the firmware
Every Day Carry
There's not many EDC anduril USBC rechargeable lights
I know a good one
Same beam
Or
Small
Like the sc31 pro?
That are throweier or floodier or exact same
Throw or flood

In 1929-1945 many Jews were forced into concentration camps or ghettoes where they lived in poor conditions and were under constant persecution. They received little food and had to live in a room with up to 8 other people. The Warsaw ghetto was the largest of these. It had little resources and many people died of starvation or could not afford a room.
Many people attempted to resist that Nazis through many methods, two prominent forms of resistance come from Emanuel Ringelblum and Mordechai Anielewicz.
Emanuel ringelblum‚Äôs form of resistance had a long term, lasting impact. He helped lead the oneg Shabbos project and documented their lives in the ghettoes. He recorded as many pieces of evidence against the Nazis as possible. He wanted to prove the Nazis wrong and show the truth. His form of resistance was more spiritual and long lasting but only took affect after the war.
Whereas Mordechai anielewicz‚Äôs form of resistance was immediate, dramatic and physical. He started an uprising against the Nazis and became a symbol of resistance. He spearheaded the Warsaw ghetto uprising, during the uprising a group of Jewish resistance fighters defended against the Nazis for 27 days. This uprising sparked many other physical and spiritual forms of resistance and gave hope to many Jews.
Overall, I think both forms of resistance are crucial. Without ringelblum many important pieces of evidence would not be around and many lessons about the Nazis would have to use their films and writings as evidence of conditions and treatment. But without the uprising many Jews would have given up hope and the Nazis would have been a lot more confident in their decisions

Deagle is the biggest pistol I could think of
With a solenoid to mimic recoil. Strobe lights for muzzle flash and a smoke generator from a pack on my back/chest to mimic barrel smoke
3d printed deagle

Ive got a fire extinguisher in here just in case
Yeah the tinfoil is 100 percent gonna fall on some live wires and short them
Everyone else has fancy fiberglass and polycarbonate or glass or carbon fiber boxes with fancy hidden electronics
Lol its such a fucken fire hazard I'm surprised it hasnt commited self kill
The plastic I wanna print warps if it isnt cooled evenly so keeping everything hot is easier than cooling everything
And after I get those 8hr prints done ill be making a nice cermaic work surface and a better box (with fancy painted walls)
Lol, its got a pvc pipe for a hair dryer to heat up the box faster
And a shot glass is faster
Nah the serface is all bumpy so it would take a while to model and print
Its held up by a plastic shot glass
Its just gotta last me for 8hrs if printing
Shhh
Printer box
gimme a sec
im doing some top quality 3d printer engineering
lucky
cool
wanna do vr in a bit
getting on

Just resend the first photo

alright im getting on
alright ill b on in 2 minutes
alright gimme a sec
but i only have til half past
nah, i can tho, you wanna do beatsaber or pavlov
No time
The test is tmrw
All right
Bruh
cool, just dm when
english yet
cool
later or nah
english??
yup
English?
cool
samuel probably
sure lets put him
sure, who do we put
not sure
cant rn
yeah, i think we all gotta put eachother or idk, we should talk on the server
we could put them down but idk
i was thinking you me and samuel and marc or charlie, but samuels gone off with charlie and marc
and charlie
nah hes with samuel and felix and samuel
Right well Samuel ditched. You got anyone?
3 i think
sure, ill put you and samuel then
Who
phone on discord real quick
wait, i dont think i have that
ao-infinity?
also 2 songs for you to download
and beetsaber?
which song
ill inv you on oculus
f
can he not mod then
ok
nah, ill help you get the same one as me tmrw
wanna play some harder modded songs tmrw
its a lot easier than i remember
just played it again
lol
um, tell them its terrible at pla and all your prints are droopy and terrible
tell them a 1mx1m build is a good idea too
the printer?
nah just talk about icecream or some shit
al;so go to the country specific chats and talk in english
and if they want explanations just say its bad and dont explain anything (or make something up)
put it in gchat
thats all
the kits are overpriced and probably made by the mods to gain money and benefit from newbies, this entire printer dangles from crappy belts and is plagued by bad extrusions and a lopsided and bulky hotend
wait, theres more
your designs would work better if they were diferently specced and more money went towards a good hotend
your corexy belt path is silly and outdated, its only built to look nice and adds failure points and is impractical. you are a server of elitists who cant take feedback
nice
it only takes an hour
no clue, i just did it this morning
Oh sorry I was on Pavlov. With marc and samuel
whayt did yuoiu write for the paragraph for adam
okkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
why?
i agree the game is obly driven by a high skill roof and needs official support for custom songs
mhm
kk
whered you go?
yo?
alright, imma get on now
noice
they realised it broke
oof
i think
noice
10 minutes?
Later?
downloading the file can be portrayed as intent to maufacture, which is illegal
file's still illegal
and downloading it counts as intent to manufacture
since its a 'part'
(3d model)
these all appy to a .stl
otherwise its super illegal
bruh. if he builds it in the us with serialized parts and metal parts, its legal
ask where he got it from
also, im fairly certain he doesnt have a working file, hes probably got a prop version of the gun
but its his choice
personally, i just wouldnt risk it
dont
Ill be on in 5
The mapping is top notch and the backround is mwah
Its so fucking good
Yes
Check the work server
Cool. Imma drop the prints at the office in the morning and get it at break
And then I'm making 2 more for the extra shiz
Its the one we can test without any mod thingies
Building
ill be on
alright
after or nah/
beatsaber in 5
Yh
So bmbf might be a week or two
Should be

The Ringleblum Archive ‚Äì self study

Please visit the Yad Vashem website following this link yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/ringelblum/index.asp

Take a bit of time to watch the introductory video (which you have already seen, but it‚Äôs worth a review) ,and take some time to look through the online exhibition.

Can you answer the following questions from information available on the webpage?
1.    Who wrote the different texts that are found in the Oneg Shabbat archive?
2.    Where are the original documents kept now?
3.    What were the archives hidden in?
4.    Were all the archives unearthed after the War?
5.    What else did Ringleblum do in the Ghetto apart from organising the archive?
6.    Why is the archive named ‚ÄòOneg Shabbat‚Äô?



At the bottom of the page is a series of photographs of actual documents from the archive.  Have a look through them all.  What strikes you about them?  What can you say about use of images, languages and different types of document?  Did anything surprise you?  If you were putting together an archive, what different types of materials would you want to include? Write a paragraph describing what you see when you look at all the documents.

vr? samuel might join
Cause the whole switch is printed
Actually, maybe closer to 300 or 400
~200
Technically yeh
Maybe closer to 100
Although you might be able to use normal keeboard electronics and use wires
And be over 200 in electronics and plastic
It's gonna weigh well over a kilo
Should make full keyboard out of it
Vr?
and piracy
or triple
or single
the dual case thingy
whichever switches you want least and are tactile im happy with, if i have one heavy tactile and one light tactile thats good
any tactile
ah cool just tactile then and i might swap for a clicky later and return the tactile, idk ill see how it goes
also if you have a clicky could i pay for one of those instead of a second tactile. then whenever i can print that case
i got the thingy working, could u bring one switch to school tmrw, and then i can assemble it in form
if i cant get them to work then yeh
nah its alright
but if i can print good ones i may as well
well for the two switches just two
dont have any on hand but they should
wdym?
trying a new design
for some keycaps
throw is built into the switch right?
cool, i couldn figure it out either so left it deault
do you knopw what this means
ill show u in school
the one i printed sits at the bottom of the stem and now the switch downst move
how far onto the key should the cap go
is there a special type of keycap to use fot the switch or will any work
im making a tiny useless two key keyboard
nvm i got it
are the mounts for every key the same
Either
Play tmre or smthing
F

Math test
Send probability
Tmrw
something
or stolen
yeah its either stolen
but v sketch
maybe
for the blind
doing my best
no problem g
also buds pro are more waterproof
Buds 2 are smaller and lighter, making them better for smaller ears
Buds Pro are priced higher, but can be had cheaper than the Buds 2 on a deal
Buds Pro have more advanced noise cancellation features
Buds 2 have two hours more battery life
Buds Pro lack sparkle, but sound less harsh than the Buds 2
slightly better audio and noise cancelling but the fit is different and the they have a slightly shorter battery
try both first
the pros and buds 2 work really well on samsung phones
from galaxy
any buds
so pretty good
it cancles out martin
then the galaxy buds are probs better, they have special fancy codec and shizz
do you have a samsung phone
yeah i really like them, if your between the buds 2 and pros you can try my pair and samuel has buds pro you can try
how come?
yeh
nice
ah thats also where i found them
cheers
so ill get the corsair if its a good price and if its not good ill get loob
cool, if youve got some spare can i buy enough to lube a new keyboard
alr if we agree then its probably the best choice
im leaning toward the red since its not broken and corsair is a pretty nice brand, and i can get that pack of reds- for repairs and for the 3d printer
where would i buy lube or can i use what ive got already
alright
a corsair keybord isnt pre lubed
or just for new build
is something reccomended no matter the keyboard
presumably since its not a custom build
i checked the websitre
theyre red
also would i need to re lube it
thats why theyre in the same category, light version of eithe ror a heavy linear
i think
a heavy linear, light tactile or clicky
or  a light tactile
nothing tactile
something louder, also a keyboard that doesnt stop typing ocasionally
ill probably buy for 10
or am i best off with what i have now
are any of these good
look at this deal i found
lol sad
idk
he wants me to

Hi everyone, 

As I mentioned today, you will need to complete your assessment essays for me for the 3rd of February. In addition I need to see the work you've been completing up to this point so make sure you attach all of the following: 
Kristallnacht essay (Answering: Who was most to blame for Kristallnacht? Ordinary Germans or the Nazi Government?) - MUST BE A TYPED MICROSOFT WORD DOCUMENT, I WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY OTHER FORMAT
Venn diagram on the roles of the nazi government and the role of ordinary german people. (Attach word document or scanned/photographed book work) 
Source table breaking down who was most responsible. (Attach word document or scanned/photographed book work) 
All of this must be submitted to me by 9AM on the 3rd of February. If not, you will receive an immediate C2,  no exceptions. This has all been outlined here and in the lesson, if you have further issues you need to get in contact with me well in advance of the deadline

Kind regards

sauel and i going in casue its only 8 quid entry
jeez
bruh it doesnt cost 15
cool laser
howd he go there
oof
i thought its just the tube
is it expensive?
its a 30m journey from baker street
worth?#
i need advice
u leave so nearby doesnt rilly matter
probably for a bit yeah but it depends
i was thinking leave 2 30
not sure
baker streeet market
just ask samuel first
but i dont think anyone else wated to to
feel free to invite anyone else
samuel
up to baker street first then greenwhich
mine?
I just wanna see the laser
vc
one sec
Np, I'll be honest some of those are just guesses
But I can go through it afyer
I got Friday dinna now
np
Not 100% sure of the very last q
sure
15 ish each i think
card+money prolly
Good night
Not sure, around lunch?
Nah it's alright, it was long division stuffs. Do you mind doing it tmrw?
can u explain q17
lemme see where you got too
Lemme Go look, just finishing my TV show
The HW? No, how come?
np
rip
How do you do 12
nah still in the showa
I'll join for 2nd/3rs round
Gotta shower first
Yeah sure
rosh hashanna
cant sorry
Thanks!
Just a English mock to do today and the research
Nah after school starts
Nah, gonna go next week I think
Cause I am just so sluggish üêå
Because 2 days
2 hours of work
Same
How long it takes for the Becquerel to be halved
That's what half life is
Takes 30 years for each half
Ye
Still at dinner
But
Alright I'll explain
How long is it gonna take for it to be 25bq
If the count rate halves every 30 years
Lad
I'll bc in VC later so I can help then. At dinner now tho sorry. Screenshot the photo and I'll take a look from my phone
One sec for the question. But the half life is how long it takes for its radioactive counts to be halved
ill let you know soon
not sure
I dont think were gonna do anything
Just wrote it into my book
Thanks for the help
No problem
is it because 35-15=20 and 30 is 15 above the lowest end of the range swo you do 15/20
sorry what math do you do toknow that
ah okay, thank you
wait yesterday you showed me how to without drawing it
for this question, just a rough explanation
how'd you do that histogram thingy without drawing it
not yet, havent started, whats the question?
cool
cool. next time im there i cn mention you
i just signed up online tbh
not sure
yup
cool
who else is going?
i can meet you at the tube station
Thanks
What's the address of the coppa club
i dont think so
Cool
When's your birthday?
Saturday
ah, sorry
yup, leave on friday
Idk I don't have it rn
I don't think so
Nah not yet
sorry abt to eat dinner
yeh dont wait up
5 30
martins got porogramming thingy now
cya
yeh thanks
i think
what did you get for question 5 and 7 on ther math hw
one sec
ready for chemistry in 6m?
im back
Getting my shoes
I'm about to leave
Sure
ill leave in 10m
yup
but which questio
can call rn
nah not yet
optonal i think, its not very useful
cool, youll have to wait around a bit
probably to us
havent looked, also we can give you a lift. we'll be leaving at 5
yeh im having  a lazy weekend
nah
just waitning on saem
yup
cant sorry
sure
Lemme ask Sam if he's got a lift yet
Depends
wait hwere?
im looking now
not sure
Do big letters and write all our notes from todag
Active transport
Phone you later
At Shmuel's
could you help me with it or nah
ah crap
could you send me the isaac fisics work
phew
we already did that test right
wtf
Thanks
Cool
Are you isolating because of your dad's surgery thing or because school asked you too?
Cya
Welp lucky/unlucky depending on how you look at it
Oh weird
Yeah sure, what happened
Can't call rn
oh well
weird
Anything on teams?
yeh
in settings
use these
just turn on mic
just join party
gaming time
we on
but idk
it shpuld work by default
not yet
nah ingame
if it no workie we just do dicsord
not sure
ill msg u here when we start
on the ingame chat
ill msg u wen
at 8
we doing in game chat
oh sick
np
resources flow from a "periphery" of poor and underdeveloped states to a "core" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former
lemme type it
yup
5m sorry

i can do it later tho
ive got tutpor now
Cool
Bring a jumper and raincoat tmrw, I'll bring a backpack for them
Ah no sorry. I'm just doing the last 4 later
Gonna do it later tonite
Not yet
yup, we're going
not sure, ive got a cold but ill see in the morning
im trying to join
cool
just dug a ton of holes straight down til i got caves
got more diamond than iron now
yup
just found another cave
sure, 10m
weve got some free ticket thing and are gonna see it on thursday, wanna go with
have you seen shang chi
im fooling you and you dont like it
ur cutting out
yeah
white house with tesla on park road, near cat hill
ah sorry doing brawhalla with charlie and marc
how do i join
thought you were on survcival
wdym party?
minecraft?
cool, ill get there around 10 30
sure, what time?
en4 9ey 6 ibsley way
Bruh im going to camp at 3
Gotta find my book
Yeh gimme one sec
Cant sorry, in the middle of some soldering
2021-06-23 08:01
Were here
Are you on your way?
Marc sent it yesterday
Its getting better tho
Nah, i got stronger meds cause my ear is funkier than the thought
And the jcoss drip
Hell nah, even if my ear gt better overnight
Ah yeah, like saw and samurai
All the good ones were short then
Like bumper cars?
Thats unfortanute
Wait, actually?
How come
Lmao, iill ask noah how his time at thorpe park was next  time i see him
Bnruh really, even i did those
Bruh, he doesnt like rollercoasters much does he
Lmao. I just saw the doctor and sat around my house. Tried out geometry dash and quit on my 27th attempt at the first level
Yup
And Just the 5 we wrote in our book
Just this year
I'm gonna do whatever everyone else does
Nah not yet
oh then 730 ish
to the bus
yeah so probably around 9 ish
i need to see how long it takes to get to the bus
tbd
cool
oh if your DoE is near mine can i go with you and alex
yeah you can go for the bus to thorpe with me
if your dropoff is near mine then we cqan carpool
i need a lift to the DoE next week but my mom can drive us to the bus
sure, what time is your dropoff for doe
yep, you wanna go with
fire
unmute pls
when do we join science
Thanks. I appreciate it
Shhh
<@!796637509668831272>  do sheeeet
<@!558976020317732874>  vc
sure
We'll go today at break
Cool
Bruh
Lmao
Thanks
Which period do we miss
Yep
Same
deflect questions to anyone better suited to answer
robbie- generating electricity and limiting our carbon footprint
dylan- energy savings and the cost of electricity
matthew- discuss CAD limitations and 3d printing limits
adam- discuss how we came to our conclusion
alex- discuss safety measures and their importance
vc?
<@!558976020317732874> ?
should we talk over what we do tmrw
no backpack i think
I really enjoyed learning about the different drawbacks of building design and location. Learning about the balance between a cheap building and a strong building, it was fun trying to incorporate traditional design and modern design into our building. i learnt a lot about japan and its environment and how climate change will effect the future
cool
cool
Its for Monday right
alright
yep
just follow them step by step
yeah its pretty simple
today
Yeh
Good
Anything else
Ive got all the prints, cardboard and a tripod
Yeh, should be
Soil would wash away in the 'wave"
<@796637509668831272>. Trees failed (tried it 3 times) best I can do is some thicc cardboard to shove toothpicks in
At low frequency it may just wobble at high frequency it may fall. But if it's secured to the table it should wobble
It will have a ruler held behind it and we will watch the slo mo to see how far it shakes
2 building and ive got a tripod
The camera test and shaking test is easy enough, the water test is just if there's water on the building or not
Well we can do a few now and if we think of anything we can do it on monday
At all
Water wont get it
The building is water tight
We could use a tripod and slo mo to measure how much it shakes
Dunno what we can measure tho
Had dinenr
Yeh sorry
And if we have time a halfway of with the wall but no trees and only a few rings
Earthquake test with rings and no rings
Wave test with wall and trees and wave v test without
nice
nice
yeah, ive got all tmrw to finish, so i can print a box for them i just dont have any dirt, maybe sand but im not sure
Ill make the wall for tsunami today and the trees during school
So ill hold off printing them
<@796637509668831272> ?
Oh so dont print out the rings
The ringd are meant to be buried tho they dont work without
the tsunami will kinda slot together but the rings have nothing holding them together
<@!796637509668831272>  do i need to make a box to hold the rings and dirt between them, if they have nothing connecting them i dont think theyll work
Cool, I can design and render anything I cant print so we will still have images of them
Then I can move on to the tsunami prevention
Ok the rings and base model are done. Ill print them today/tomorrow then ive gotta do the flexible base (may not be feasible but ill try)
cheers
hey <@!796637509668831272>  ive designed the rings and should have them on monday, i just need to check a couple things- can you send me the sources for the 2 design features
alright, this will be easy peasy to design- we should compare it though against a basic building without these
have the flexible pole (not sure how this works)
earthquake-
this would just be some soft 3d printed material that the building sits on
ok i cant 3d print trees so what about a field of toothpicks
im gonna build the earthquake test and tsunami test but whats the third and which features are we using for the earthquake and tsunami prevention
yep, this is good
Export as .stl or as .obj then compress the .stl (obj is already compressed) and drag and drop it to discord
test decided so far, temperature change in a rectangle building and in our building with some air insulation, earth quake (which solution are we using), tsunami testing with sponge ground and rounded walls, earthquake with pipe going through the building (i dont fully understand that one)
so far we decided on 8-12cm tall buildings with single features, they can be destroyed in testing since we only test one feature/feature set per building
<@!796637509668831272>  compress the 3d model and send it over and i can start modeling the building
tell them ill be a cuple minutes late
im changing it that was fom purim
wait
not sure, cant change it rn tho
are you guys in
im not being let in
yeah that looks really good
<@558976020317732874>
@Dylan be on in 5
<@!558976020317732874>  yeh after lunch
im getting on
oops, forgot abt that
alright
breek time then
if not break time tmrw?
same
last period?
sure
<@!689804811897536536>  meeting i=ting
cool, ill do that later
which part do i need to do of that
and they have materials that we would build with/3d print with
ive found a stress testing site, it has every single simulation i could think of and i have 6000hrs of computing time so we are set in that department
thanks
yeah
a electronics case for my printer
this is the limits of my design skills
bruh
'vibration generator'
ive found a website for simulations
i can ask about how to record testing data
solar windows
do the thing
<@!558976020317732874>
sqaure based pyramid with a cut off top
<@!796637509668831272> that was kinda useless, his point was that 3d pinting is easier than hand modeling
chill
im on
Im going
kk
ill ask him about 3d printing and his expeirience with it
dylan can you change the angle role to have the light red colour for the username
your role is just the basic member role and dylan has 'ultimate admin' pretty much
dylan gave people roles on the server, its mostly cosmetic but also gives you admin and such
yeah i dont see a reason to meet with hiim, unless hes gonna contribute much (he hasnt) its kinda just a awkward waste of time- until we start building it then im sure he has some more practical skills
yeh i think so, what do we need to bring to the meeting
so what do i need to write
also shall i start my part of the report or not yet
nah, what is it
and high density calorie rich foods inside
both, pretty foods that arent essential outside
we can, we have the ability to do that
Probably find the most expensive residential area to live in and choose there
i saw it on a ad so imma keep looking
nah
Sure lemme find it
cool
if they get better or worse
yeah but how eathquakes were in 1950 vs 2010
or how buildings in tokyo have failed in the past
<@!558976020317732874> you can also look at recent catastrophies and old catastrophies in tokyo and coimpare the change to see how the progression is going
yeetus foetus
kinda
alex just got dunked on
true
see what would get planning permission
we dont know if what we wamt to build is even legal
resaerch what measures are already in place and the building code
dude with google we kinda dont need james
just cut it flat
no pointy top, its to ineficient
but BIG
ill maybe ask about 3d printing and the seaweed
ask about growing seaweed and using it for biomass
im taking notes anyways
no thanks
ask about mesh
and absorbs lost of water
stops water corrosion
mesh provides support and absorbs vibration
a forest with evergreens and planted in a dirt area full of a spongy mesh
better flood prevention
mention the trees and mesh dirt
large yellow flower
its a plant
yeh
<@!558976020317732874>
Snake Plant and this one too
the plant Garden Mum requires low maintenance and makes a lot of oxygen
<@!689804811897536536>  wanna ask about the garden
yep, its so awkward, especialy  with the teachers sitting silently
im good
trees help against tides during a flood
for corrosion resistance and water retention
ask about creating a garden on top or around the building with a spongy mesh inside the dirt
a cylinder wont take side impacts well
a cube has a lowe surface to volume
a massive cylinder
oof
so adam can also speak]
i can take notes
whos taking notes, and adam do you have all the research
nvm
its only at half pst isnt it
Join Zoom Meeting
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89139191062?pwd=VFN4V25rYVpIWHlMMDNoK2RQRXZlUT09

Meeting ID: 891 3919 1062
Passcode: 759696
Thats ok if it's not done but its up to you if you want to make it
<@!796637509668831272> heres all the research, every single limitation i could find
general design for real buildings

‚Ä¢    shorter ceilings provide more space vertically and reduce the volume of air that needs to be heated
‚Ä¢    stagnant air makes buildings uncomfortable to be in, make sure you building promotes airflow- this also gives better more even heating throughout a  building
‚Ä¢    natural precipitation can add weight to  buildings so designs should have a lot of headroom in terms of maximum load
‚Ä¢    fatigue from constatnt stress or corrosion can slowly destroy a building-these can form at squared corners or bolt holes to close to an edge
‚Ä¢    cyclic loading can cause a building to collapse under normal conditiions
‚Ä¢    vandilism can also destroy a building if extreme enough
‚Ä¢    if your building cant support itself then gravity alone can make it collapse
‚Ä¢    if your center of mass is high enough, a tiny amount of sideways force can knock over your building, so a lower center of gravity is essential
‚Ä¢    equal loading provides stronger buildings
‚Ä¢    unexpected loads can make buildings collpase
‚Ä¢    weak foundations can doom a building to collapse
‚Ä¢    
general 3d printing design or limitations
‚Ä¢    real buildings have equal strength in every direction but 3d prints are extremely strong in he z but not in the x and y axis but reorientating a part can fix this very easily
‚Ä¢    3d pprinted parts are completely hollow or mostly hollow meaning they can be crushed before the material gives out, a injected material e.g expanding foam would fix this
‚Ä¢    3d prints with shatter violently under stress- usually
Computer Assisted Design
shall i include design tips for cad in my research and tips on how to increase strength in a 3d print or just the first one
helo
ehh
it could pulse a heater at regular intervals
dude a arduino could easily do that
thus saving power
but you could shut down power to pparts of the building when somones leaves
<@!558976020317732874>  ive got so much to read
droughts may be a oof for those that rely on that water but a sytem that supplements a normal water supply with that would be pretty good
that can be had for less than 10 quid so thats easily acheivable
I'm happy with it
adam                          ?
robbie                        ?
alex                           real life buildings in tokyo and how they are designed
dylan                        sustainability and mundane managment
matthew                   design for 3d printed building and design of real building
research:
pla is cheap but very brittle and rigig and softens at 60 but is the most rigig plastic
true, i assume were going to use ABS or PETG plastics to build this (abs is temp resistant up to 110 and will stress than shatter understress and petg is temp resistant to 80 and will stress and stretch)
<@!796637509668831272> just do let you know (i dont know if you were there when we decided it) but we're going to try 3d print this at the end and install electronics and such (testing hardware)
i wanna do design research- what material, design tips, space utilisation etc
<@!689804811897536536> we though the pyramid was a fun shape
and have seaweed growing on the living walls
in the ocean
biomass
but....space go skrrrrr
or 3d design
ask about CAD
poggers
what time is the meeting, and whats it about
ye
should we start working on it tmrw or procrastinaste for a bit
same
oof
all biomass downsides are nullified by using it under water
but biomass is pretty good,right?
but it has trex arms
this would be a good house
poops get funneled to the biomass genertaor
remove co2 actively with seaweed and the nuclear shz will need to surrounded by lead
and the shaoe can help funnel water to the biomass generator to cool it
and the oxygen made by seaweed can be used to give our underwater bunker air
also it takes no additional space
seaweed takes co2 and makes oxygen and when it dies, voila
biomass with seaweed
<@!689804811897536536> iceland is super safe to live in
fine
under water near tokyo <@!689804811897536536>
<@!689804811897536536>  under water
WHAT IF THE BUILDING IS JUST E
taj mahal-nuclear bunker edition
our schools ina pretty safe zone
nah nah nah, someone else can just mention that we can do it
also a lot of problems are solved by the fact we can 3d print
yeah, that or underater
if we use any geared parts we could submerge them in antifreeze/oils
thank god for adam
yep, we've not really got any questions
bruh he looks like ellis
E
hour long meetings oof
bruhhh
i cant watch it
the video wont load
im on
wild fires
impact resistant
sandstorm
freak weather (heavy hail, fast winds)
extreme cold
extreme heat
flood
tornado
lightning
earthqauke
tsunami
hurricane
and add electronics
and print it
obviously
that would be pretty dope
and they build this 
HITFACT¬Æ MkII 105-120 mm is a combat proven Low Recoil Force Large Caliber Turret for light wheeled vehicles and medium tanks, with more than 500 units in service with Italian and International Armed Forces.
maybe, they make weapons and space shit sooo
and they bult some of the iss
the commission ems helicopters and do navy and army shiz
the Leonardo company sounds pretty dope
F
oof
bruh
nothing for me
is anything happeing
you guys on he breakout room?
cap
yaes
i am the shirtless dancing guy
E
gren
bruh someones breathing into their mic
kk
we didnt get that sheet tho
i think we just go through it
not sure
hmmmmmmmmm
Oh well that's a genuine run innit
<@983240138354221076> 100% a time lapse
Toast?
Just watched, it's so cool. Does it not cause blobs on a printer during the pauses
Surely that looks like the temp target changed throughout the print
How do you patch it
Oh fr
thats whagt the config looks like
i suppose run it with whichever is fastest then 
[printer]
kinematics: limited_cartesian
max_x_accel:10000
max_x_velocity:150
max_y_accel:2500
max_y_velocity:100
square_corner_velocity: 5

max_velocity:200
max_accel:15000
max_accel_to_decel:15000
max_z_accel:150
huh really
you pretty much add a couple lines in your config and use winscp or alike to drop a file into klippy/kinematics
fair fair
its pretty easy to install
but youve got the fastest speed benchy!
could try it to get higher x acel without having the y skip
also 48v?
are you using limited cartesian?
was gpt out then
i cant tell, its 2021 tho
i thought acetone does nothing to pure PLA. but the filament we buy is ""PLA"" so it sometimes dissolves. same way abs+ doesnt dissolve fully
would more straight lines allow more time at speed and less slowing for tiny turns?
It's only a few dollars to buy a pair
If you have stepsticks
Iirc the drv8825 can do 36v or 42v (can't remember which) seems an okay choice for cheap HV. Don't know how they fair in action though
damn nice
what hardness is that anyways?
holy shiet, my printer keels over and dies if i try much more than 25mm/s tpu
wait how?
oh mines at 35, whats normal?!
whats your minimum layer time?
true true, now i gotta go through and switch extruder
gotta re run the y since i turned off the pi accidently
it worked! hows the new graph look
old vs new
hm
ive got wonderful adhesion
i mean
actually
yeah the bed is probably upwards of a kilo though ive never weighed it
ah otherwise i saw someone say hot glue
for the bed, would a clamping mount be okay?
cheers
true true, whats a good one for a volcano, or any m6 thread?
urgh ill suck it up and remove the nozzle then
the fan mount isnt in use, i could do one there?
cant do nozzle rn
what would be a good spot to mount the adxl
should the boards axis align with the printers?
with new mount
lemme repeat
my mounting was very dubious
its currently 2 sheets of steel + a 3mm thick steel frame for the rollers to screw to
at some point ill have to switch the bed to something lighter
eek
y tho
im happy with x especially considering theres a full size nema sitting on it
just used zip ties and blu tac
might need a better mount
hrm
I'll try it out maybe
I've got a knock-off adxl
Hm
<@826460928261226517> same thing. Following klipper tuning I get 35hz for my frequency
Lemme see how this new one goes
Yeah
85mm/s
Set to 60 now
7k Accel and 30 scv iirc
Retrying
That looks wrong
Erm
oh yeah wheres the guide for smoothing tuning
testing settings for the top half?
hey so whichever frequency im modifying throughout the print, will it be visibly changing throughout the entire print or only 2 of 4 corners will improve for the x axis
It's pretty similar  to a e3 right?
prolly
itll be fine
i dont go super fast
hmmmmmmm
so 3x 15= 45
Airflow: 15.6 CFM  üò¢
cool cool
i figured some airctic silent fans would be nice
did you get any brand or spec in particular
if twos sufficient i an always install the third into the elctronics case and fuinally remove those awful winy fans
cool, ive added a 3rd fan so it fits my cr10 better, if it hangs funny ill reprint with some support peice there
whats that part for?
cheers
is it u there now?
cool, i have some spares to make it with, is this on your github?
yes please the mounting bracket, what size fans are those?
hey <@192355339721506816> what kinda speeds did you get on your ender
can i enter after the stream?
Lmao
So that's 7km/h. Cool. You could break the speed limit in some parking lots üòé
Has anyone been able to hit 2m/s?
Not that I know off. I'll take a look later
Weird
Are comments disabled for everyone?
Yeah, and didn't even try stiffen the top of the frame
thank you
sorry, which website is the one for bstock?
Ah oke so you do a little fanagling and get all the  accelerations on one side
Excuse my ignorance here, but if you've got an equation to find acceleration, how can acceleration show up in the equation
if your at an heating limit and not cooling. i suppose the filament out the nozzle would juuuust be hot enough to go down nicely and then be cooled quickly without proper bonding. maybe
If everyone gives 5 dollars you'll have at least 40 dollars
Lol
Best I can do is five dollars
3 supervolcanos feeding into a supersized CHT nozzle
And the double stack those
Double stack them. Or get a LSD 6mm hotend when it drops
If there's a stratasys prototype that's not on market costing 10k+ then it would be valid
Rip. They caught the big dumb
It's the traquair from maze
Ehh just show a close up shot and stick a logo on
Can nitram claim his used to be a flsun
Honestly just have a annex guy win and hold a internal giveaway or something
L. Someone here's finna win 2 grand
Kek
<@430380494795046923>  <@402947808669204501>  what mods do you have for the ender
Thank you. I'll send a pic when I get it mounted (a couple of weeks from now)
cool
yes please, ive been thinking about designing my own. but you got there first (and i hvae 0 design skills) so ill just adapt yours to blow across the bed and for a cr10
yup, the big ass external one
hey <@826460928261226517>  could i have the stl for the cooler
Look at the Instagram I seny, thats the guy
Around 5 minutes iirc
Yes Melvin 3d printerfun has
cool
push pull if sealed is better than push pull when unsealed right
cool
<@!103467169622265856>  whats your limit rn, motion or extrusion or cooling?
if i need it i can make a guard for the heaterblock to stop the fan cooling it
screwed on here and have the top of the fan line up to the where the hotblock is
for external cooling can i just use a unducted fan on the x axis (cr10 printer)
oh i missed the linear rails
or even cf everything
or a cf build plate
any changes to have a lighter y axis or x or mostly stock/printed upgrades and motors
the bed is moving pretty quick, it'd make sense for x to do that but damn. congrats on that speed
how?????
whats the difference?
but its probably not the safest
ive heard a air compressor from a refrigerator is alright
Steppers and drivers are confusing. Would more industrial machines be fine tuned properly or more like 3d printers where it's good enough to not tune
Nice
So sprescycle has a dynamic frequency
And is the trinamic tuning spreadsheet changing that chopper frequency. And that hum is what you hear when the steppers are energiser but not spinning
And would increaseing microsteps change that frequency
Ah, do the a4988 drivers have a lower frequency or what causes there noise
I see, so the guy is wrong
Like those step graphs you see where it's a wave
But because steps it goes on off really quickly
So if it's a 24v system then that's the bus voltage
So it would explode something
If you apply 24v on a coil from a PSU it's just shorting right
Can someone fact check this
Tbf it might have been repurposed or from a project. But to build from scratch the frame would probably be better in alum extrusion
Probably heavier tho
theres not much more too it
he touched a motor and it felt hot
you could shave off a few grams, not many but a few
god damn thats only 24v, imagine 48v+ some weight improvements
for now ill test with water and thew principle should be the same for different fluids
and again itll be on a ceramic tile with a fire extuingerisher
i dont have a rig that could make use of this, if i do build it itll be pointing towards a heated block and measuring how quickly it cools
ah so id would rathe use a pump and push it through a  thin nozzle
neat
ah so i could just pour it all over my benchy and not worry about shorting anything
is ipa conductive?
ah so it would be nasty and impractical for normal prints but it could be done in a well sealed printer
how come we dont mist cool the speedboats?
if you squint really hard then a write a better description then its pretty good tho
whereas PS is like a person walking around dog poop
does it do like a rolling ball and just move forward to its location regardless of obstacles
The. It would be nema11
Unless it's a vzero
6028 fan?
huuuuge fan
tiny board or huuuge fan
you can @ maze and ask, hes sount out a few samples iirc
what kinmd of testing?
oopsie
if i ever build a benchy rig maybe ill get that fan
well, i do have a spare server psu for 12v
and are the heads independent or one huuge head with multiple outputs?
whats the current motion system
For infinite overhangs
Uses a gel and a uv led array to have instant printings and cooling
Since they're trying an all (mostly) metal carriage the 1 plate has all the mounting holes cut into it so it looks like swiss cheese
Yeah there's a plate between the 2
I'll check later but I believe vez fixed that
I believe you can direct mount a few but most need funky mounts
Mount holes in the bottom is a pain in the ass for a couple hotends
The lgx lite mounting is a nightmare, the vzbot mount for it took a while
iirc soemone was working ona  cf lever already
thats with a steel lever tho
where the biggest change is for flexibles or personal preference
but with stiff bowden, which may or may not make a difference, bowden vs dd may become a moot point
but that may not mean much at .4mm
ive heard from vez that bondtech claims some mighty numbers but on a 1.2mm cht and m+
I wanna see that with a mesh or with lots of super thin wires
it took me 5 hours total to install the rspi and a buck converter and make a klipper config (if you are on a stock prusa theres probably a premade for you to check and use which will cut ~40m off)  and to set up both fluidd and mainsail and to get a first print
its very beginner friendly, once you connect a lot of it is just ctrl+c and ctrl+v
I always forget I can just ask nitram/vez/Albert a question and 9/10 times they'll respond
Although It looks like it's rather been wrapped around the fitting
So assuming it's rigid enough it could be wedged under the heatshrink
Pmma cables looks like fiber optic stuffs
The metal mesh could be taken from a sheilded cable or you can just buy it and if it's a PET mesh it's the cable wrap that the ender uses pretty much
It's just a metal/PET mesh surrounded by 10mm heatshrink
Other than the word above wire I think I understand it, just gotta find the right PTFE fitting
oh my bad, i though youwere talking about a hotend
is this for cooling or extrusion?
but wait for the .4mm nozzle numbers
ive no real situation flow numbers, only with a 1.8cht and m+ hotend but they were still pretty big so maybe its worth looking into
assuming that wasnt sarcasm, you got any reading material on that
do you mean they realize they are 'behind schedule' and just skip what was planned and jump to where they should be
üò≤
id hope the pla filament was full of pla but im no pro
Saw a short yt vid showing a prototype
That's the black box project iirc
This guy's a teensy weensy beast
20 buck i think
ludicrous flow
A 5 stage volcano incoming? With a flow splitter too
3d print a one use mold using dissolved support maybe
PET mesh + possibly wire wrap used for shielding + heatshrink
perhaps a cable driven printer will give us more speed
which probably makes them slower for fast movements
but they only use cables at the top and not the bottom, e.g the hang printer
just a theoretical
the coating also means no direct contact but i have no clue how this even works sooo
yeah same here
nah its brass
lemme go check
heh, the bt cht is nickel plated brass, so its a near direct comparison of geometry
I imagine a long heatpipe and water cooling the end of it would be the most effective
Nah this is big
ah i remeber that guy, tbf he was using old random steppers
I did a very early beta build on a very small budget
Yup
Nah my printer is barely keeping itself together
one thingi dont get is on along hf hotends with big meltzones, will tis still provide much benefit
its a shame its not a rigid moun
tube
itd not your everyday nylon, stuff like PPSU and PCTPE and GF30-PP Glass-Filled Polypropylene and pekk. i havent personally used any of those but when a kilo is upwards of 200, going slow and steady and babysitting the printer is what i would be doing
but not great
so its not awful
tbf thats 12x faster than the slowest filamwent there
this part just got me
rest of the vid is great
thank you
ah cool
havent heard of them before
but what makes them bad, im still a noob at this stuff
whys wagos bad?
a small metal deflector or wool will fix that
Well if you scale speed with thin layers then the time doesnt go down by much since the onlytime increase will be travels/retractions but travels are near instant and retract is off. But why go faster when you can go slower for the same time overall
So if they can go faster, why not#
They have enough torque if you buy the 9g alum gantry bits
I gotta see this
Please link
Cheaper makes it more accessible and the vzbot uses a x,y and e while you dont need a z 48v. But a delta needs 4 for full hv
Small windscreen wipers could just plonk it off ez
Bruh
And the main idea is to reduce print area and add more failure points instead of using batch printing
Whcih makes you slowe?????
So you spend more time cleaning the printer and prepping for next print
Arent clear path kinda like cherry switches. Well known and good enough for a starter to use easily but is easily surpassed by some more obscure and slightly more advanced brands
would something cheap thats one solid peice work as long as its disolable or meltable
just out of interest
is that expensive, and would a one use disolvable filament be cheaper/easier.
maybe a water soluble filament and a un-openable mold
i was gonna say with closed cabin maybe
ah
Could you stack male and female pin things til its tall enough to fit in
Technically 35v is the max the chip can take but the stick is usually around 29.5v
A good hotend costs more than that thing
Oof
I thought retraction is to just stop backpressure wich stops stringing and some melted plastic (cause its sticky) gets pulled out
Potentisally, if the filament squirts out and doesnt stik=ck you get spaget
The lines stop squishing together right, then they pull apart easily
Same with audio
<@!127589634522742795>  its good quality
How will tghe livestream be announced also what time was it
Smart
So when the next starts extruding the other is pulled out
Ah I was kinda close
What is it
Could try streaming on discord with the stage thingy
Im gonna do sme shilling. Better discord (might maybe get you banned but its not happened before) lets you add some customizations and quality of life stuff and lets you 'note' stuff or pin it but only for you
Yeah like if it needs re flowing or if a component falling off
If thats not it is the raspi damaged anywhere
No broken wires or cracked insulation, and psu is staying at the right voltage ie if its 24v the step down is set to 5.2v and doesnt dip/spike
Sounds like something physical, any loose connections or iffy wires
Is it worth buying a long long shaft of one diamter and cutting and flanging (bevel or whichever its called) yourself
No denied the magic......sooo
Magic?
Servos?
Is it the other way round, i can never remeber, is it smaller arms are more rigid nd more fast but less space
Also imagine if someone did the equiv with a delta with longer arms for higher speed
Thats a record right, can i see (idm quality)
Oh damn
After 11 Britain time. I can probably join
I'm down to join. Just depends what time it is
Tbf hes got the mainsail thing right
Ah
<@!173827530929733632>  drop it into <#789941624108089345>
Ah cool
Oof, im guessing you get voltage drops under high load then
(step-up converter) is a DC-to-DC power converter that steps up voltage (while stepping down current) <@!126746418143559680>  what wattage psu did you spec to use with a step up and whats the base voltage
Also powe is by inverting the two power pins and direct wiring to the psu
2209 DO 28.5V MAX
Have you tried what nitram did, also that audio is dope, you can hear the motors and rails ramping up
Is the audio real or artificial
<@!822479329215774720>  that slo mo is so heckin cool
They have a ton of cool drivers
Yup
Thnaks
T i or t L, discord font is hard to read
Ah so its only good as a super budget testing driver
But yeah it is onl a super budget driver
Havent heard of those issues, short tldr?
And drv8825
My plan is also to buy one and slap some phat ass motors on plus some longer arms for speed plus a skr v1.4
But also what rob said
Ah me neither, just angled/top cooling seems to avoid everything but the gantry, i suppose a heater in a large cheamber with a inlet for cool air and then a larger fan (180mm if thats a thing) that way all air through the fan is already warm
What if you did top down cooling, a massive grille vent as the top of the printer and it just blasts air down it
Cooling is kinda <:RedThumbsDown:834127221265924176>

ah would the other mode of gcode better then, i think relative gcode
Could do verbose gcode and manually remove it
With it being custom made we're gonna add all the standard bits and bobs plus higher voltage and a few other bits and bobs
especially for more lab envireonments where they make custom small filament batches
some more expensive machines afre much faster so if you splurge and share the cost over a discord server's region then you could make the money back
Metal in the nozzle, no biggie
Not a single mention of actual higher speeds

Wait, where
Ah cool. I assumw thats for small nozzles mainly
Whats the ascended do differently. Also for peak stupid a biconcave filament and little hair likr structures cut into the hotend bore would be maximum contact
Ill be a while tho. Out rn
From a while back. Lemme see if I can find it
Probably
I got a 10 percent boat with a .3 nozzle so a 20 with .4 would be fine

Reference to a comedy sketch
The cults been quite busy recently, its undertsnadable that hes been swapped with telling newcomers to go away /s
Try with what youve got and upgrade later
Keep a fairly conservative speed and ramp up acel until you cant go any faster (tune y since you can change it per axis) then set that as max acel then increase speed until it skips and theres your limits
I've been manually orienting the infill? Ive got it going in a straight line across the boat going from hull to the back
Cheers
Ah well i didnt change a thing so ill leave it stock
'Sense resistor' whats this for, or is it worth changing
Ive just been reading throuhg as many klipper/tmc docs as possible, perhaps add/tune it and see if it impoves the time
instantaneous_corner_velocity: , what have you guys set this as in the [extruder] secion
Lol my entire printer journey is off the back of his videos, ive watched his marlin flashing vid at least 10 times
I thought printes nylon worked better once it got a little wet (after printing)
The hv can do up to 50v iirc since the mosfets arent rated up tosuch a high voltage they are replaced on the hv version

Ah pog
Do you have a second printer, also try slower feedrates, perhaps the spacing will change, and try 2 blocks to see if its evenly distributed. Although you may have already done that
Same problem?
Right so its geared up at the motor and down again at the extruder
Does that mean one spin on the extruder is 6 at the filament or the other way round since the extruder would go faster if its 6 here is 1 at the filament
And will  max_e_velocity/max_e_accel work on normal PA. Max accel is found by running at low speed and stepping up accel then step up speed until you reach a max right
Quick recap. Using dalias' code you do  max_e_velocity/max_e_accel and thats the smooth time. This gets better prints at high speeds (as shown so far but ymmv at higher speed)
Avoid 'ironing' and use a skin layer that uses lines from left to right or [90 270] and a thinner width with slightly less floe
Damn. You guys are likw 'i think there might be a problem time to write a 50 page thesis' which dont get me wrong, is awesome. Just wish I had that much dedication
They are genuine leadshine though
I thought he meant the whole extruders .movement is smoothed out and makes small details non existent since its not extruding them
why not reccomend it and then if people run Into errors they don't understand use the default style install and then go to discors for help
Whats the 3dp discord you guys are talking about, ive never seen it
In their discord so thanks to him and tbe very polite community
Yup. I was a noob and coffee practically held my hand setting up klipper
Twitter is so silly
Yeah, people are now crapping on fluidd/mainsail becuase people prefer it to octoprint
Not sure if this is the right place but hes claiming 20m/s/s which double josh murrahs 
Plus content
Yeah his expirience is with very different 3d printers though and his audience isnt as technical as most of you guys
Speed makes such a differencw
I was prototyping a part (had no calipers so measurments were estimates but it only took 15 tries to get it right) and i had to do it on a dog ass slow printer so i got a bigger nozzle and volcano and things were faster but not great then i built a proper corexy and finished the project in a few weeks (estimated finish before corexy, 2months)
What channel?
although. That's what a cultist would say /s
I mean common hobbyist 3d printers are perfect
An yes. There is no where to evolve to. Why even bother thinking about resin level layerheights at the speeds we use
Rtv silicone?
With my fire hazard of a wiring job its never more than a hop and skip away
So to test the burnt motor thingy. Ive got a teensy tiny pancake ill tune it with and a spare 2209. If either burns up or if the stepper gets past 90c ill call it a day (I can test it at max torque easily)
Also ill be fiddling around with it so if I get anything good im sure you'll hear about it
Also in speedboating, it lets you boost past the currwnt limit. So on hard corners you can go just a smidjun faster or for the extruder you can get the fast retraction or quick change
Thanks foe the explanation
Right so its a lot of redesign for a bit of benefit and no one whos able to redesign wants six point so it just hasbt happened (same with tuning trinamic stuff like coolstep and all its other settings)
Also question about dc step. That just slows down then speeds up to get back to where it should be wich is useless for a 3d printer unless all axis do it but that would be silly
Ah cool, so its a lot of effort but there is a benefit to it but its kinda not worth it
So take a fat chunk of salt
I havent seen a comparison between the 2 though so I may be completely wrong
It uses a higher immediate jump in speed then a lower jump until ir hits the right speed. If steppers can do a certain amount of immediate speed why not take advantage of it
So if scurve wont work then why not the six point thingy. That gives a higher immediate accel then medium then lower and reduces ringing at speed
Wouldnt that just be the reccomended acceleration
I still want to see if theres a discernible difference and if there isnt i can just leave it on and have cooler drivers and steppers
From what i saw it reduced current to match the torque needed and then boosted it past the rated maximum in short spikes of load
Dcstep ill probably leave off since i dont fully understand its benefits for our application
Well coolstep does, kinda. It lets the driver boost to a higher power and stop the motor from skipping and under low load keep the power low (wich unless im wrong) low power=less back emf wich means more acceleration kinda
Im looking at tuning coolstep and dcstep, is there any special knowledge i should have or is it just try what i can and if it goes well do it to the printer (ill be testing with a spare driver and motor)
Cool
Cool
Thanks, it looks like coolstep is also available in klipper but from what ive read you need external hardware or some other tuning method, are there any guides for this
Would s curve or 6 point be better or is it a negligible difference
Thanks
What ramping profile does klipper use for acceleration
The best you can do is a timer behind a mesh screen that is moved slowly in front of the printer
Anyways back to my busy life full of busy stuff (quick disclaimer, im at school so i got shitloads of free time and 0 responsibilities so not a bummer)
Totally
Ah..yes..i too had 'a week off'
Nice
So I wont have the negatives of speed limits that st3althchop has if I enable interpilation

What time?
Nah thats line width and plater optimization mostly
Same here, hiking was not fun when the weather is just rain
Kiuah, it turns out, is like 3 lines of code and i didnt intall it til recently, so much easier for anything
Ah im just kidding, i run marlin on my cr10 but i dont like fiddling with it, my corexy (soon to be vzbot) on the other hand is klipper and i love it
Ah he calls you cultists so i gotta stop this conversation... *Salamander is love, slamander is life*

I asked if i could take a tour at their factory sincd i was popping by during the summer and the cto directly contacted me (my dad) and said sure and asked what time, so their friendly and happy to tour people
Rather multiples .4
Especially with walls, no parts that are well designed will be designed for multiples of .33
Nah it's cause he doesn't machine them. They get machined somewhere in China. Smh
Hows spreadcycle, any more speed or nah

ah crap, just vgot back, you enter it into the site (do a few mm less than since it will touch the very edge if not)
You may have to change microstepping to 16x or 8x and the file may need to be altered but using notepad++ you just do find and replace all g01 with g1 and a few other tweaks (plus homing ansd that shabang) and hen you are set
Yes gimme a sec
Lol someone undid the screws on my belt tensioners op my cr10 and i didnt notice, the only thing holding it in place was the screws being levered into place, i got awful prints and couldnt figure out why for a solid week

STaY bAcK
Elitist
Ahhhhhh!
27 here and the world is ending
Its the difference between a delidded cpu and a normal cpu
Oh i got it
I think either, ive seen more like that in photos so ill say that, you can solder a glass bead thermistor in there and measure difference bbetween the 2
Ohhh, in chamber. No clue then
Closaest i could think of, i guss its closer to having a long heatsink then a fan or a short heatsink then a fan but im not sure how to describe it
Cnsidering the steppers will never get hotter than a cpu would any generic cpu thermal paste will be better
Radiant energy, like cooling a heatsink that goes next to the cpu but no real contact vs a direct copper plate
If its not making contact either get some thermal pads or cheap thermal paste and apply a small blob aqnd sperad evenly
Make sure the windings contact the plate but yeah looks good, just duct it or use a large fan weith a bigger duct to cool both
Ive got some, theyre alright but do something proper since they dont screw in
Or use a phone water cooling 'patch' and slap it to th black part or daisy chain them all round the block part
You could print a jacket that screws into the the entire motor that pumps water through
Afaik if you cant get the black a lot of heat will go to the blue part
Nah its got a stm32 but no drivers, just heaters and thermistors
You could make a 4 wire cable that delivers data and power and hide that board between the mottors but its a lot of effort
Fair enough, there are extension boards wich are fairly small form factor but it still adds wires and bulk
If you mean you're lacking in ports you can always get a zboard and use some old melzi board
The themristo allows the fans to be run at lower power during normal printing and then at high temp it can power on (or you can use a 12v fan at 50% until a threshold where it goes 100%)
Peltier draws a feck-ton of power and it just makes one side warm and the other cold, so while it would cool very well it would make a lot of heat that would need to be dealt with
Or water plate + pump + thermistor
Heatsink + thermistor + fan
Speedboat?

They sell a lot of great stuff, most of my power tools are from there and my mini vice, just check out their special buys (lidl too)
They also sold it as a local 'warehouse' to online buyers
It got dicontinued but that shit was the bees knees, i got some of my nicest prints with it with a bowden tube a good 5mm of the heatbreak
My local one had a crap ton of it sent to them (they didnt know why) i sent in a aemali after buying some online (labelled balco filament) and they said i could just walk there (10 minute round trip) and buy it in person if i wnted but it eventually sold out
When he made a filament sensor he only showed high quality expensive filaments (said 25 bucks per kg was cheap when aldi sells ¬£12 1kg and i can walk there and pick it up) people asked for low quality filaments. Its all great to see good filament is good (duh) but we wanna see how bad cheap filament is
The documentation is hard to find but well made
And now ive get a fairly alright config
Dude, i heard of power over ethernet and got confused when my pi wouldnt turn on
Never got around to watching his stream but ive heard it was a bit of a sh*tshow, he used power tools on everything apparently and said it was more consistent then by hand wich it is but only in torque but eh, and apparently his printer does 1m/s
Lol its the only game that i can play above 30fps
Stacked em'?
I doubt he even stopped by here for some help with the bad extrusion, and he thinks its gonna top out at 175mm/s
Thanks for the heads up
Oh sorry lol, shall i delete it or just leave it
He claims a max feedrate of 350 or volumetric flow of 14 with the wrong extruder motor and current of 500ma, sigh
This hurts
Ah i think <@!265629116106145793>  has something similar in the works
Direct filament to block contact?
Huh
Why not, who can extrude for the longest without skipping, you start the extrude and as soon as it skips you hit stop on a timer (after finding your max flow rate that is )?
It's DIY
Its the brand new super skeeter compeeter<a:hypercatvibe:743208354192818238>
Impossible.... tolerances from his own sons factory
Are you using multiple hotends, multiple hotends and one nozzle, are you pre heating?
Quiet or noisy
No need to say anything definite, but roughly what's the idea behind or part of one of your solutions
Servos?
Oh cool, well I honestly can't wait, will this be a relatively cheap product that any consumer could feasibly buy or will this be a bit more ·¥ò Ä·¥á·¥ç…™·¥ú·¥ç
Sounds like you're gonna run into flow issues at those speeds then <:smilethink:666013443224109102>
What if it used 4 extruders into 4 hot blocks that go into 1 nozzle. Awful foe anything other than a speed benchy but much more flow
Melty fans are a wee bit less efficient /s
Ah makes sense
Whats the tape for
Damn. And here I am on dd doing 4+mm
<:chefkiss:643937705910337536>
Those walls are looking pretty smooth tho
Damn. So crisp and well defined
i like the new pfp, stands out more so its easier to see who's who at a glance
i think the question was do you prefer the order: inner, outer, infill vs order: outer, inner, infill. cura allows for the inner wall (or maybe outer first i cant remeber) first and while it can make the other worse it can improve accuracy and overhangs
Guess I'm subscribing
if you have a enclosure you can dry all your filament in there with some silica for extra speed
the remote direct drive i found uses a square rod to turn a gear similar to a wades extruder but different and it span the entire length of the x axis and followed parralel to it, it used a bearing around the square shaft and allowed for any extruder motor to mount off the frame but still use direct drive and not need some spageti flexible metal shaft
like this one
with a cf bed frame (built like a flat drone frame) and some fr4 it would fly and slap a hextrudort on the x and you are golden (or if i can find it a proper remoe drive)
arc welder only really helps in marlin and if its enabled, jerk i use whatever my print speed is usually but i run 70mm/s stock but you can go much higher for a speedbenchy, cura resolution gotta crank it right down until the model just looks like a benchy but not too deformed
retractions, wipes and combing can get a little funky, also check the breakdown for times in cura and focus on reducing whichever takes up the most time
best i can reccomend is read up on a gcode wiki and understand what it does then talk to the big guys (nitram vez or 247printing or some of the green guys)
you can enable commented gcode and just slice out whatever is using gap fill or unnesescary travel
its a 25% difference wich is big put slicers are notorisouly bad at estimations
so 4min less isnt unreasonable, assuming your slicer isnt tuned and he is using modified gcode to remove gapo fills
it has a faux volcano and titan so it could extrude that fast and the bed is fairly light
looks plausible to me, whats wrong with it
but yeah he did at some point choose steppers, it just might not have been a actual decision
unless those are the old dog ass ones that dont work to great for his application
ah, i think its either a money, logistics or only owns those 2 printers kinda thing, no reason to not reuse odrive
wheres it say tjhat, i thpought he just left the odrive in commission and build the night shift
best visualizer is have a ton of slightly rotated cuboids and watch each motor
and different degrees of rotation will utilise each motor differently so if your x is super duper fast have the infill oriuented 90 degrees and have the print at a 15-40 degree, 15 will still use a bit of the y but mostly x and 40 will use a near equal amount of both
since your x axis is super leight on a cartesian since its just the hotend pretty much and whatever other cooling you can get great speed but on its y its bogged down by a phat build plate, so try both and stick to whichever is best, easiest test is run the one same print but ones rotated
although having it at 90 degrees may be better, its just weighing up options and trying whichever is best
And watch the speed difference on one axis (x)
Try making a move on just x at a certain fr and then another on x an y that uses the same fr
<@!822479329215774720>  Slower motor speed for a bigger combined 'ground speed' if that makes sense
ah thats a shame, i wonder if it would help at all
i think they just moved on to a new printer and wanted something different or have the old printer in use and didnt want to scrap it
same as doing a 90 degree on corexy, it utilizes both steppers so potentially more speed and doing 90 degree just uses x wich is a super light carriage (if designed correctly, potentially lighter than delta)
is there anything to be gained or is it the same as drilling through a hole 5 times over (and accomplishing nothing)
ah, i didnt see that, thanks for pointing it out
could you force it toi stay on to see a graph showing how much it helps, since it would cancel out the resonance its measuring (if that makes sense) and you could see if it caused other issues and if it makes sense tune over the tune until you remove most resonance
<@!822479329215774720>  i see your benchy on the genius is rotated so its mostly on the y axis, would a 45 degree or 90 degree turn not be better in terms of speed
so somewhere near 60mm/s¬≥ flow rate (assuming its a linear scale)
its just for some tuning of input shaper, once tuning is done it will be removed until its next needed
but i may spend a weekend editing a vid of some dog ass i3 printing a '3 minute benchy'
lol, 'with our sponsor filmora 10 you can edit and create videos easily'
hahaha, ive been waiting for someone to edit the video of the clock to be real time (crop and drag into a place a 3 minute recording of the timer) and a timelapse of their printer in the rest of the screen but leave it wide angle enough that you can just lift up the clock to show its 'real time'
a wire mesh with heatshrink tubing and the connector i got no clue
did that one with abs+, twice
on the nozzle? a print with a set screw would work
and to stiffen it to make feeding/retractions better
Technically ite the heater thermistor sock and block
no further comments
if we race right now at this moment in time my printer will beat his
ya know, i think my printer could beat nitram, assuming we have a race right now
heheh
you me4an integrated driver?
but 2 2209 are fairly cheap
unless you feel like your lacking something i dont see why you would
e3 printers and similar dont have the capability to microstep at high rates without maxing out mcu so if you want some higher accuracy with less microstepping on a non interpolating driver you can run higher speed
do a dry run, no filament
6 volcanoes stacked together to form the super-duper-ultra-mega volcano
use some stacked volcanos for 2 heater zones

true but if he did it would be interesting to know
so he ignored the question of whether this is funded via profits or savings
'Rac, you can ask me on telegram if you have questions, feel free. I gotta head back to my assembly task today'
unless he gets really agro
nah nah nah, i would like to see where this goes
after i ask whether some of his design is a good idea and whether he manufactures at home or from china
'Exactly. Seems like he is intentionally trying to test my patience and annoy the heck out of me.'
'Most important for me is to make great products and to make them as accessible as I can to help push the 3d printing niche quality'

'It's not designed to be messed with, and that makes no sense to even assume that. Fan is a part of heatsink. There is no logical reason to install and Uninstaller it many times'
yup, hes had it on his printer for a while though (apparently) and said people dont usually cycle the screws much so they should be fine even if they are kinda weak
in response to threading metal
'Oh, well, if SLA printed threads were working perfectly fine for nearly 3000 people, I bet metal will work 3x better'
ASSUMING HE RESPONDS
LET THE GAMES BEGIN
ah, but i can be a idiot too, and its impossible to win a argument against a idiot
gimme a sec
well ill go ask
also his 'clever' design of not threding the metal sounds like way to save money (and im sure that cant be good for the metal)
oh for sure, just not the level of effort he leads everyone to beleive, i couldnt do what hes doing but he cant do what he claims hes doing either]
Shouting at underpaid workers is really exhausting
Hey emailing a Chinese factory really takes the energy out a guy
Ah like crappy linear rails
Slice is right near sfu iirc
Just say its manufacturer in china but I check quality by hand and am certain its good
Yup
My bad. That's usually a scam company's pull and assumed he did too
He has nothing over triangleabs or really any other manufacturer then
Ah so it is from china and just re sold (kinda). That's fairly scummy
Does text not translate well or does he straight up get these from a chinese manufacturer then slightly 'modify' the product to make it made in USA or wherever he says its made and then sells it
use a relay to turn it on or off or some large 120mm faNS
And for cooling some subambient hevacs and berd air should help
Perhaps thats the next thing to look into
Someone mentioned a plastic that meltd at 60 degrees
Yeah e5 can do 80 at the quality e3 can do 60 since its lighter and better supported y
Well the Bed is heavy and causes vibrations so the z and any screws and springs and wheels around it will wear prematurely
Bed parts mostly but also the belts
Agreed on the last part and for the first part the stock parts probably wont last at those speeds
in stealthchop they make no noise at all, but on spreadcycle it hisses and beeps
i hate the hissing noise on tmc tho
ill be testing that at 45v at some point
very true, drv are very loud and 2209 silent in comparison
no profesional here but the weird spiky stuff looks bad
how on earth is spreadcycle silwnt, either im missing something or my steppers/wiring are doodoo
stealthchop is great for e3 printers and such where its low speed and torque
welp i love fast prints so back to 0
dang it can i not have it at something low so when its nt moving it goes stealthchop and while moving spreadcycle, i hate the hissing noise they make
time to change that to 5
wot
wait
cool, thanks for the clarification
ah so this sint something i can read by choice, if something wrong iut will tell me otherwise i wont know about it
is there a way to force it to send me the errors
my bad, misread this 'poll failure i results in an M112 '
so if i send a m112 during a print it will send me alll the errors withlout interupting a print
Holy carp. That's practically gonna jump out the nozzle
Would be cool to test, whats the melt temp
Also the more rigid the tubing the bettee
A good rigid and short one is near dd in my experience
For more rigidity when extruding
Its wrapped in wire mesh and heat shrink right with toothed couplers
carbide something iirc
Dang it was really good for tpu
-20% overlap
Try less infill overlap
That's why I'm sticking to steppers
Waat a mishap with a a.c. servo might tear my fragile cheap aluminum frame into parts or might just be a stupid waste of power for a 3d printer, nah that's ridiculous
Nvm then
My bad
Aren't servos way overpowered for printers torque wise with occasional peeks
Do i have linear rails for my z, yes
Did I need linear rails for my z, no. Did I want linear rails for my z, yes
I mean. Not really and neither is having a very cold room
<@822479329215774720>. If you post it with the # in the title I can check if it looks right
E.g #shorts will change aspect ratio and be displayed more often
I believe you put it in the title
his brains smoother than a polished chicken breast, yikes
if we get a section for servos you could move the entire bed at near the same speed as the hotend for double the speed
true
the averaging part is just to smooth out temps a little so that you dont jump from 235 to 236 to 230 to 238 to 234 to 233 to avoid triggering protection in marlin
true
it just averages out the amount extruded over a amount of time (like PA smooth time i think but no expert) its just to avoid your temps flying around and triggering a thermal runaway
i think marlin has a autotemp that raises and lowers it temperature based on a average amount of filament extruded
i think the best design would be a thermistor inside a nozzle but thats pretty hard to do with modern cartridge style
Makes much more sense with 45kmm/s
Oh snap. Got the conversion really wrong. I thought you meant 4000000 (4 million)mm/s
Meters/second^2 or mm/s^2
Yikes. Abs it is for the bigger temp delta
Ah all right I suppose it also burns well and gets kinda weird at higher temp
So while its not gonna look good would it not spew out really well
And its low melt temp would make it really runny at 300C
I would think a quad hevacs and berd air would be enough to cool a fast pla benchy
im gonna try it with a double/triple stacked volcano
what else is modified on that printer thats more low level stuff, like loctite on bolts or re building linear blocks (nitrams delta)
and 3d printing is the best way to do it, so why not make a bulky mount and reduce it
the other removes material and makes it strong
has anyone tried making a bulky mount and using generative design or the other one (cant remmber the name) generative design takes mounting holes and connects them best it can
hewy that looks pretty good
any second now
im sure of it
you know what
perhaps the big players are gearing up to release their 2 minute stepper benchys
Ah. Cool
And over what distance (long or short)
On klipper?
Much better quality and less time
So instead of 1 shell and gap fill it does 2 thinner lines
It usea different line widths where appropiate
Fair enough. Cura has far more dials to turn but worse quality from experience but arachne slicer is somehting else
Thank you
Ah I see
I much prefer curas customizability over prusaslicer wich has far fewer settings
By searching for m204
So I just use notepad++ for example to check the time
Is that the time estimate
I had a print predicted for 10-15m and last upwards of 2hra
Wait. WHAT. That's I cant slice a sub 40 b enchy on cura
Will work with notouchfirmware though
So the effector offset means its more stable since the ends are near the middle. Or are the arms longer so you can get higher speeds. Also that 12mm belt upgrade is gonna be pretty sweet
I reccomwnd eddie the engineer and the documentation. Also if you get stuck check example configs and other peoples config
What changed?
Dont worry about instal. Its mostly copy and pASte commands. Hardest part is doing config but theres defaults and really good documentation. Im a massive noob amd did just fine
ah cool
hm, i think im going faster on a leadscrew, not sure tho, are you being limited by the z or is it not a problem
mm/s?
whats the fastest speed youve done on z
just for shits and giggles
im gonna build a triple stack volcano and 'injection mold' a benchy in 1min and submit it as speed benchy
i prefer that, you can see in steps how much longer it is
its probably not hot enough to melt abs maybe soften some pla, all metal will probably start to melt it, but yeah its probably the same as the cold part of dragon (if the dragon didnt have a cooling fan) but i have no actual data
well that part gets warm but since the whole heatbreak is one material it has terrible thermal conductivity, and i dont know if the official one is like this but my heatbrek allows the ptfe tube to butt up against the very end of the heatbreak and nearly touch the nozzle
hey thats pretty smart, single stepping means far more precise movement i guess over time
lol i get 15 maximum
ive doen 0.4mm prints on a .8 and vice versa
just run identical gcode with the 2 different nozzles
easier flow but same amount of filament
what about a 0.5mm nozzle but extrude 0.4 lines
i mean sub 25
i think 25% scale and perfect print
ive gotten pretty small on my cr10 with awful tuning and it looked pretty good
what about a new class of smallest fdm benchy thats identifiebale by a non hobbiest as a benchy
I guess he might need new steppers and a volcano clone and new firmware
True. But the mini has linear rods. Bowden. Small and light build plate. Bad firmware tho. Bad hotend too
Design iterations that would have taken me 2hrs to print each now take 1 for bith
I love high speed printing
Also
Gotta bump up the speeds and get 10m
Crikey
45?
I think he can get a good time off one of them
Oh man those things are so light
Pog?
I think a cash prize would need a separate class
Sounds interesting
Fixed on prusaslicer
I still get funky chunks of solid infill in the bow
Thr particles will dampen all (most) vibrations
Have you tried filling the channels with sand
im making one with 2 stacked volcano
oh?
Would you mind sending over your profile for cura, I'm about to get a boat done
32, what a noob nema42 is still underpowered
10mm/s and it skips. So I'm gonna set off a b enchy for tonight and then tomorrow ill be back with a vengeance for speed. So ill aim for 400 and lower acceleration til I get it. Then lower power then increase accel
Should in lower it until it skips and then increase or just leave ot
Its all good now
Well 50ma mire imma test
Pog
Why why did it get worse <@192355339721506816>. I do 50ma less and it grinds instead of moving
Hahahahahahahahahahah. Sure
Yep. Only at high speed
Gimme a min
Well actually. Lemme check
Cheers
Alright
Yes
More current or less current
But the x is skipping a mm or 3
My y stepper is fine with no skipping
Dang it
Ill get a submission in and spend the weekened tuning to perfection
I'm going back. Even after a ton of testing its overall worse
Okay well lowered the A and its doing worse
Yup
In every single direction
Every single corner
Ive got brackets for days
I think sub 30 but I might be wrong
My bad. Mines 400mm or so but defiently 376g
Thats already inclusing hotend
Bur imma get rid of the extrusion soon and get down to 300g
Welp. 600g give or take 50g
I may have done some maths wrong
300mm
Extrusion is 400g or so and rail is 50 plus horned wich is maybe 40
Nah carriage is a barbones afterburner wich I now is kinda poopy but meh
Including rails and ectrusions
Or at lest I should tune with this current then reduce it until it skips then increase a bit and tune speed again
So my gantry weighs roughly 500g give or take 50g so I think I need that torque
So. I guess turn acceleration to 100k and tune up speed
700 sorry
Huh. Mines at 7 or 8 ma
Depends what stepper. I'm using stock creality ones
90 or 120k or something aorund that seems good
I reached 180k and didnt skip and was told to keep going
I can lower the accel then in favour of speed
This is just what ive tested so far
Zero g custom corexy based on ender 5 frame
Also ive had no skips, ive put a mark on my finish position and its always lines up with my current values
Ill do it after tuning, ill link it here
Im gonna drop it to 145k and try higher speeds and scv
And my build is nothing special
No way this is right but it looks like im getting 180k acceleration
It means instead of accelerating on each segment and decelerating it accelerates along the whole move then decelerates
I prefer arc welder for its simplicity, I can see if theres a difference after I tune with running the same gcode and 5 scv
Quick question (I havr a lot): does scv really matter unless you use a infill with 90 degree angles. The benchy has very little 90 degree angles
Welp I'm at 180k so I'm gonna leave it there and tune speed
Hmm. Diagonal moves are silent apart from a high pitch 'coil whine' and stepper motor sounds but anything on the y sounds like what I imagine resonant frequency to sound like. Ill see if I can get it to pick up on Mic. Dunno if thats normal
I think if the silhouette resembles a benchy its good
<@746853934286635048>. Have you considered trying a 4wdm. If youve got some spare stepper motors then its easy enough to make the front idlers onto motor mounts
I see. It shouod keep climbing quite a bit then massively poop out. So I just gotta listen for skips. Cheers
Alright. Cause I'm hitting 109k accel and not maxing out at 50mm/s
Also for tuning speed. If I do acceleration first do I just keep going till I cant accelerate any more and then turn up speed or do I find top acceleration and decrease it as I turn up speed
Perhaps time to dive into the tmc spreadsheets and peruse the tuning guide but its up to you
i hear reducing speed to 20mm/s and 500mm/s*2 fixes that
i planned on pre heating the filament with it but both work
peltier is only good if you have somewhere to put the heat
oh and ratrig
We are all submerged in 80% nitrogen right now
Or liquid nitrogen
Mineral oil
None of this is viable for large scale production but it could all work for you guys. Also peltier üëå
I wonder if a hevacs with a Peltier would be good. The peltier pushes cold air into the hevacs and the hot air is run over the filament before it leaves a dry box
Also a fridge compressors and a cooler element would let you do sub ambient but for a lighter tool head, image a berd air but it goes around the bed amd stays at the nozzles height
Auto print removal via pressurized air
Ah thought so, those belts look pretty beefy too
Daaaang, dunno what magic sauce hes got but i want it
Right
That was a servo he was using
gn
Would one of the speedboaters mind sending their slicer config, thanks in advance
awww yeah
yup, happens on quite a few infills
bruh changed my infill pattern and got this, jinkies
what the fuck, my corexy is predicting 23m
thanks for all the help
alright, so it seems im not gonna get too close to any highscores considering my build is sub 300, but i do wanna be in the top 10
also whats a rouch estimate of the cost of your printers, i wonder if theres a real comparison between price to speed or if its just from tuning
just in the slicer rn but yup in klipper, im gonna bump it to 50
hm im using 60k in the slicer and it seems im only reaching 80mm/s
what speed and acceleration are you guys using
why not a compressor and use a valve, run the compressor before a print (outside) and use a valvo to control airflow
Hevacs style system wink wink üòâ
These tmc drivers are used in professional environments and are profesioanly tuned wheras we just slap them on our printer and let them rip
I wonder of there's speed to be gained or at least cooler steppers or just quieter operation
<@746853934286635048>. Have you manually tuned spreadcycle like you would pwm on stealthchop
Get aluminum tape and ht wool and wrap it
That's just how much volume of filament can be pushed through the nozzle. E3d v6 does 12-18 and that limits you to sub 300mm/s whereas a nova claims 50 or so and that allows up to I think 1m/s
Just strap a weight to the x and boom. Equal
driver_PWM_GRAD: 6 does anyone know what this does in klipper
yes
psh imagine having all your wires together, mine are clearly all twisted around and in a spaget mess to combat noise
so, can i use a heatpipe connected to my stepper to use as a heater in my hotend
not standard but some people are doing that and printers arent very large machines typically so theres no room to upgrade after build
ah alright, just wanted to check incase you had some black magic to fix it
before or after the driver
in what spot
if you have a 24v driver outputting 24v and then a booster that goes up to 100v you could use any board and driver
ah, so if soemone made one that could we could use any driver at 100v
the skr pro doesnt, the other do
so in theory a boostconverter after the driver would let you use a 24v driver and boost up to any voltage e.g 60+ aslong as theres a beefy psu supplying the buck converter, unless hes using it before the driver to use a 24v psu
you can also try drv8825 with 45v if you just wanna mess around with hv
Read a few spec sheets from some manufactures
Awful for anything that isnt cosmetic
Titanium. And yeah massive particles that rip up nozzles over time
Yup. You need higher temp and in sone cases a hardened nozzle
I know white is very abrasive and rough and very strong wich makes it flow funky sometimes. Although theres no way to know whether a harder pigment will create less pressure since it's not springy or wether the soft nature of a springy pigment will make it move smoother and 'dampen' itself
Or just a natural one with no pigment
Nice. @me with results. Also ill look at different pigments and their shape. We want tiny and smooth ones
Also my Bowden tube keeps slipping up from the back pressure in my hotend, I'm gonna make it all metal next week but for now is there any way to stop it
I suppose the easiest way is find a good manufacturer and test flow with 2 colours custom made from the same batch and see how each performs
jesus christ 125, but yeah abs plus is super melty but is a really nice printing filament, the colour thing i assume is to do with pigments and how some are particles and those may be larger or smaller and sharper or smoother
You can add a volt or 2 and gain some wattage until the new heater arrives
Try a step up converter theyre 1 quid from amazon
lol imagine using mirror like high quality blocks and not some $1 pack you got from ali that came with 3 blocks and one nozzle
ill be using a stacked volcano for some high speed large nozzle prints
people wer spamming vlad with questions and he couldnt get a word in
less spam and time for people to get a word in
its better like this
i think they do that for esc wires to keep  the signal clean
why not spin the thermistor wire
ferrules would work, i think or not
like holding a electromagnet near a data cable your gonna get funky ressults
makes sense, high current wires next to a sensitive probe
yup
a perfectly sized melts it assuming its good tolerances, a oversized one takes a while to equalize pressure wise since it only melts near the bottom
why not a conical shape, to let filament in and then soften it then fully melt
Mh but vlad states a lot of things
i think the real thermal bottle neck is the filament and its poor conductivity although the block still plays an important role
holy moly, time to get me a 48v psu and get melty
300+ watts
exactly
probably get some reall melty metal
you could do the same with a uncontrolled 12v heater 60W being run at 48v
cheers
yup <@!126746418143559680>
is there a way to zero the printer like a cnc and just tell it its at x0 y0
i use sensorless homing and theres no space for enstops
ah so 10v higher
standard drv or stand 5160
so those do higher voltage than normal 5160 but the hv can do 50
Oh yikes. I guess ill go to drv8825 after this
Sorry, lemme edit it I meant 36 on 2209 (or somewhere around there) and 48-60v on hv 5160 and ill also try some drv8825 since they do 45v (or something near that)
And after this I'm doing a super high speed delta inspired by nitram but since it will be my 3rd printer I dont mind if it's slow progress or inefficient
Even if my build has taken upwards of a year im still gonna finish it
Well I know for sure I'm doing 36v on tmc2209 and eventually 48v on 5160
what insulation are you guys using around the hotend/nozzle
true, just using a cheaper set of 30s at higher voltages is more economical
just reduce the duty cycle
or a 12v heater and a step down
try a step up converter, you only need a few volts more to gain a ton of performance
nice
but you reccomend that wool stuff (not actual wool just looks like it)
wait for six bucks i also get a ventilation system, you're4 highered
whats shipping like
what a steal
how much?
ah good
lung problems or heat breaks
in summary: all metal is safest, good ptfe is safer than cheap ptfe but ptfe=probably not great
thanks
im aiming for 36 soooo. but can bucks even go upwards in voltage
buck converter up or buck converter down, just wanna check before i buy a new psu
gimme a sec
sure
So I don't see why all of a sudden my flat walls are wavy asf
Its rotated 90 degrees and the idea still translates over
Identical belt path
Nah cr10
Inverted belt
The edge should be completely flat
lemme get some photos
yep
so i tried flipping my belt and now i have terrible wavy walls
yikes
true, and the only benefit is the cool factor of having rotarty delta and normal delta aio
for a double delta, why not run 2 sets of arms all connected to one effector and offset
time to get building then
cool
<@!126746418143559680>  does bowden tube length matter much, ive got the option of mounting my extruder on top of the printer and greatly reducing its length, its gonna be very ugly so i wanna know if its actually effective
yes but not the pnuematic fitting we usually used
also, i couldnt find any of those barbed fittings, any specs or links
looks like that means you can have really high accel on x and a reasonable amount on y
do you have any tips for a speedbenchy that dont seem so obvious at first (like the wrapping of the tube)
nice
so a wire mesh and heatshrink tubing on top
<@568917972199145515>  looking at their design the ribbon takes up very little space?
ill check out that rocket - i can extend the nose cone
how much space should i give for wadding +streamer
ill slice each part individually and update the weight in open rocket
i can get up 41g
but i can make it solid
<@568917972199145515>  34g printed
43.6g in open rocket - lemme check printed weight
whats a coupler
any other issues>?
so ive got motor mount done
dont even need piano wire
fair enough then
ezpz
i can do bent piano wire actually
how hot would that metal get?
so ive got everything except that metal bit covered
this rocket engine mount from a estes alpha rocket appears to be a glued tube that the rocket friction fits into - mine is just a friction fit tube
6cm cavity so 1cm of engine will stick out
heres what its really like
shallow angle and isometric view
friction then?
fair enough
why not
yes?
its a small shelf inside and ill glue it
but it mightve been tied
tape iirc
and the cone will be a firction fit
adding a mount for the shock cord
i need to thin the leading edge tho
the fins are 3mm thick so they should be okay
i wasnt sure on how to do it in openrocket so ive done it in CAD instead
hows this for a first DIY rocket?
1.01 cal
45m/s top speed
80m flight height
a8-3 engine
3d printable CAD vs openrocket
amazon.co.uk/Umichen-Reflective-Greenhouse-Covering-Blanket/dp/B09W5LTVRW
this for the streamer
string for the cord
everything else printed
an A rocket shouldnt be too much force right so id be oka to use string? and the same cord that ties to the body and nose also goes to the end of the streamer?
id prefer a streamer i think, i have wadding (idk what it is) if it helps
cool, could i get a hand figuring out the streamer/parachute
this is the basic idea for a printed a10 - i can print this easy peasy. i gotta figure out the streamer tho
will 2 fly dead straight?  until wind takes it
whats a minimum
2 cal is a good stability minimum to aim for in open rocket?
why the paper body? much lighter?
because it was unstable?
fair enough, im mostly just wanting a sanity check
fair - can i @ you in a bit with a rocket design for 3d printing?
the cf is just for fun, id make a cf A engine rocket if i had to
if someone wanted to get started in dc circuitry stuff id tell them not to go over 30V as a beginner and to check for shorts before powering on. whats the beginner rules of rockets?
thats fair - i just really really want to make a cf part even if it doesnt work
after that id like to do some CF stuff, its the driving force behind this project. i want to expand my skillset
im down for buying a few A engines and going ham with the printer
is 3d printing a option too?
yeah i want to do the layup and all that
streamer is what i meant üëç  - if its a option of one or the other id imagine a succesful streamer is easier than parachute cause it cant tangle as easily?
does a B engine seem reasonable for a composite rocket? i dont want to work with something super fiddly so id rather not go super small
to be safe i need it to be stable, have a parachute + ribbon/marker and launch in a rural space?
gotcha - im not quite there with all the different terms sorry for muddling it up. that cleared up my question quite a bit
im very rural so im not worried about hitting anything - is the recovery to avoid litter and dissapointment
whats the go to engine size for a beginner diy rocket?
pretty sure my last rocket made it to a lake or tree, it was a pretty rushed launch as it was a kit my aunt bought and asked me to do with her kids
thats sick
sweet
it tells you the direction and distance?
how do you use openrocket to aid recovery?
i suppose i dont need my first rocket to be with a c11. i mainly want to do something with carbon fibre
ive done 2-3 estes already, lost them all to the wind but they did have parachutes and whatnot
will the ejection charge work with such a long body
i forgot its got to come down
i dont mind if its unrecoverable
its a c11 motor
the nose cone will probably be printed and the motor will be held with printed parts
is it a bad idea?
id like to make the body in 2 halves including the fins. i have a 3d printer, my plan is to use PVA filament to make mandrels that i can hammer/clamp in to form the fins
id like to manufacture it with carbon fibre
idk what else to share, but ive settled on this design for my first rocket
Go look
Oooh
Where can I send it
It's so much better
No
It's spectacular
On my life. It's the coolest thing I've ever done
Y'all where can j post a photo üò≠ I have something cool to show üòã
sad
no stream
damn its busy
like beatsaber but on drums
one where the drums actually could line up to a real drum kit
is there a drumming game for vr
getting like 2 seonds of delay
tf happened to my oculus link
ü§∑
i guess those were the racist ones that got removed and replaced
hm theres 3 reacts i didnt click]
I usually just click all the reacts on a message
I don't know where tho
I got a warning for a racial slur react
otherwise i know i already like pavlov shack, i wonder how long til ue5
alright, i think ill buy contractors and if its better than quest pavlov ill just stick to contractors
is it worth getting both???
im also looking at contractors for 5 gbp
is pavlov worth the 20 gbp
theyre very expensive, almost 100
for the quest 1
for people who have prescription lenses, where did you buy them (uk)
im trying to get a less biased sample. artists are moe likely to sell. the average man probably wont sell stuff
welp
its not a scam, i dont know how to provwe it but i can send screenshotas of it i guess. its just about microfactories
hey all uk students, hows your schools DT facilities
e.g access to a cnc, drill press, bandsaw
please @me  in any response
Bruh got the wrong guy m8
üòãüòãüòã
They're used to my light shenanigans
Gonna make it arm mounted with a backpack power source
Finished building it todah
yeee
made a nicer one ^
top quality bauble
no
oink
bruh use phishy
<@207571602559336449>. Polycarb with some additives is what buildtak is. The additives make pla stick so without them pretty much anything but pla sticks
try printing on a thin sheet of PC its nice and flexible with REALLY good adhesion
Cool. Thanks for the response. I think the Fake sun uses LED strips but diffuses it better so that seems like a good route
Also one way mirror to keep light on the inside or is it really not a problem to fix
And what do you use to light the printer
Ah cool
And would it be a good idea to put a mirror at the back of the enclosure to get a better view of the printer
Like diyperks does with a old tv
Has anyone tried using a artificial sun to light the printer
Sorry for the late reply. But yes you can see it. Theyre charred since they caught fire and the on has that melty look to it
Yeah the 5v is completely fecked. Board cant even power up
Plugged a tft cable in backwards
My v1.4 is toast
Ah shit
janky? yes    functional? kinda
so sautered in my own
my driver didnt come with the diag pin
i think dutch dude has this board
Nah the tycho by trails. It had 4 motors per axis. Like a awd cross gantry but ones upside down
Assuming it's berd air related. Whats the issue
One for cr10 that doesnt need great flow, one for corexy that needs good cooling and a third for a bank of vapes converted to smoke generators with a led panel for this competition ---->
Cool, ill get two cheap 24v and one nicer 24v pump
Is there any reason to nit get a 5v pump + relevant psu
And whats the cheapest source of air pumps that run 24v
Would you say the berd air system is a more lavish upgrade or something to be standard on every printer
Same lol
Ah, nice
How?
<@347144798102093825>. You could lube it but try suspending it with rubber bands
i was gonna get a bouncy castle compressor out of a tip but i didnt have time
ah cool, no black magic then, just good old mounts
in the design page it talks about how the hotend has 'minimized moment between nozzle and linear axis' how was this implemnted
can i quickly ask how the hotend is kept stable
cheers
are the HEVACS .stls available
<@715981165651034113> ^ incase you missed it
go for the highest microstepping possible without losing torque or running into isuues
Contact support. If they say its a setting thing then it gets fixed if it is what it is you might get discount or free stuff. Either way is a win (and community opinion will help validate whatever support claims)
Why not a printed jacket that goes around the stock sink
will these mount on a voron style belt path
thankfully the items i wanted were roughly ¬£3 cheaper overall but one was ¬£2 more expensive so the cost kinda equaled out. and with the price overall being ¬£4 with shipping the discounts were worth it. but nearly everything else was more expensive
i think buy the cheapest kit and trianglelabs gears
is there a barbones, super light extruder carriage
Wait. The hotend is 14 or shipping is 14
plastic spends less time sitting around before melting means less time to heat up
wouldnt high speed and bad cooling be good
well would having the plastic move through faster not be better thab low speed and bad cooling
wouldnt air cooling/water cooling not matter if its just for the heatsink
@me if he replies
Phaetus afaik
cant wait to get my v6 running
<@!207571602559336449>  i agree, there are other alternatives and they patented a\ very specific and niche design, stratasyays on the other hand patented a heated chamber wich is incredibly generic
I honestly cant wait for a clone nova but for now I can live with my ¬£4 volcano upgrade kit
Nice
V6 version ever coming
Hi I'm planning on building my own printer with a few tips taken from miragec and the hevort .hevacs obviously and I was hoping you would tell how you secured the hotend, im going for a barebones hotend mount so any tips or tricks on stopping the nozzle from deflecting would be much appreciated
Louder
Those are .9 steppers which are usually loader
What kind of plotter would you get them from and why not use them
<@666353412291690496>
Check out waterott or watertott (cant remember spelling) they have hv 5160. Or if you just neer the voltage drv8825 can do 45v iirc
Heheheh. Thats how I melted my first pla motor mounts
Just a wee bit
Real smooth
Cha
Cha
Uh oh indeed my friend
Klipper is rms not peak
Does ir only happen on certain axis
Perhaps add mass
L brackets (steel or aluminum) tos stiffen the frame or use ones like on the vzbot on 90 degree angles
Add more brackets or put the printer on something heavy and test
Why 23 over 17 (just curious)
The high voltage version supports 50v so nope. And a cheaper path would be drv8825 wich do up to 45v
<@257878979694821380>
Nothing fancy
And use a soldering iron
Buy ones 20 percent higher voltage than u need
<@184942570181361664>. Ig you replace some capacitors (easy enough to do) ypu can do any voltage you want as long as your driver supports it. E.g dr8825 support 45v
<@703758492808511568>
Photo of the printer please?
<@791039721534259200>. Aa long as theres no open flame cardboard needs to be VERY hot to combust
thank you, you're a life saver
do you have a link for that fitting?
Try tensioning the other belt more so its square. If it was good without the belt then its belt tension
Ah
Would a 16 tooth pulley give me more torque and therfore higher speed or would I hit my step rate
which lines, the vertical ones or the diagonal ones or the ringing
well, you can either desolder them and put in new ones or buy a cheap replacemnt board with modular step sticks
They happen on a4988s and a tl smoother might (very hit and miss subject) fix this but the best thing is to just use a different driver
same
Especially if you dont use silent drivers
Without them your printer will sound pretty awful
was a PITA
i had mixed and matched mine by accident, had to test every block on every rail
those just slowly drip feed more lube into the rail
I did a 25 oil 75 grease mix and the rails are superb
If you have a euro car parts in Germany then its ‚Ç¨5 for a can of ep2 white lithium
How did you hammer it
Make sure its the plastic piece thats bad not the machining before you go chasing perfection on the wrong part
Well whats your price range 5-40 100-200 high price is relative
If I have really cheap rails what size bearings should I buy, mines missing a few, its mgn12h
dunno if i would tho
you could
i mean
*for high quality rails
this is what ive got, 500g is PLENTY ive had it for more than a year and its not even an 1/8 empty
oil is reccomended for fancy rails for best performance but on less god rails grease is good
ps look at euro car parts for white lithium grease
so grease is best if you want silence
the grease is smoothest but the bearings dont feel like hey are touching the rails, oil feels nicer but its much louder
Did you write the notouch btt screen firmwatr
also try a clean firmware flash for the fun of it
dang, not my area of expertise
klipper?
how would that work?
Come at me
And the quality is dubious at best
I can suater 8x8mm wires
Lol. You call that a flex
My bad
Oops
Zv does much more smoothing iirc, so you just use a different smoother thing bob. What's your square corner velocity?
Tpu becomes permanent, great if you wanna do like me and print a buffer to stop a glass pane from slamming shut and print a block on the corner, otherwise it's fairly annoying to deal with. Especially since type is very chemically resistant
Would a quick drying silicone grease spray work as a dry lube
Also how durable does that dry grease feel, and have you considered bearings like these:
its called the zero g/mercury one
my main printer doesnt have 4wd support so im gonna have to design and print it, so i cant wait to get that set up
i cant wait to get a 4wd printer
holy moly
Guess ill turn it off
Weird
Interpolation isnt stealthchop (in case you've got them muddled up, I havent heard of that problem before)
Accel for nice parts I run 15k decel 10k top speed 130 scv 30
Would you like me to send my config. It's working fine with some 2209 I got so you can take the pins and possible a few other bits but that's it from the config
So. You wanna align the diag physical pin with the boards diag slot. Then you find the pin name and tell slipper that diag_pin: 'pc8'
The pins just refer to what metal peice contacts the other metal peice. The pin name is just how the controller identifys the contact points if that makes sense
Fluidd and mainsail do it and iirc so does klipper screen
Ohh, without losing build volume, got nothing, other than losig z volume the best idea ive got is a servo or smth
How cone you just shove the dock on the opposite end of the x and when it slides over it picks it up and probes
nice
what about trianglelabs knockoff bltouch
Bfptouch?
I just donnu how to wire it
I dont need it to be smart just a simple flick switch will do
But I dont know hoe to switch them on or off
And the leds (both series and parralel and dunnow which draws less power)
I have a power brick to power some leds and I have a bracket ready
Cut hole in bottom
If you happen to have problems you can just wire in a small 5v fan and cut a hole in the top
And its inside my enclosure
Mine sits in a sealed case and runs at ~40 degrees and i dont have any issues
Ir a locked box with a big red 'KABOOM' button that turns the printer on
Why not use a keypad with codes assigned to people then ya know who did it
mine just some stepper driver heatsinks on, will that be enough
you should set up the phishy bot, 
<@&790627922054479912>

This is just setup for my printer in my config
Make sure you reconfigure it to fit your printer
Pog
No back right*
I can send you mine, it homes to the back left, its not exactly a hevort but it is corexy, so adapt it to the printer but otherwise mine should work, assuiming you mean klipper
Less shitposting ever happens here vs gaming ones too
Smaller community ans bigger impact maybe
I think its just popular 3d printer subs
And ratrig
And in ZeroG and in vzbot
Yup
Lmao what idiots
my bad i can delete it to keep the spam down
wait what else has happened i was unaware of
<@!487739686622724107>  is the hevacs publicly available, and how do you keep the hotend stable during fast print moves
Incase you cant find a inv
Yup, they have no cogging and are fairly cheap as seen so far
ah cool, im good hen
ah i see
Whats your use case?
Ah cool
If you have klipper does it matter if you have 32 or 8 bit
hey <@!703758492808511568> i think <@!691386337068187688>  was looking for you, regarding the 4wd mod you had on your youtube
Dunno, let me know if you ever find one

[LaserChicken](
That's valid tho lmao
nah theyre just straight
ive got 18 awg wire rn for it
yeah
it hasnt helped, i can only think of how to find at what distance they cross over- i suppose they have ~2 degrees of divergence so maybe no tilt is neccessary?
because the beams expand
ikkk but im not sure how to math it
but i dont need them to cross, i need them to form a asymptote style beam
30-40 for the LEP
about 10m but there must be some tilt to the bem?
it would blind you if pointed at a close target
170 thousand lumens likely
but would it not be siiiick
that might need to wait until uni
but yeah, 3kw of UHP beauty
sweet
oh youre right i should research that
like 0.1 degrees each towards a central beam ig?
would i need the beams to be angled to converge?
imagine itd be around 92 million candela
10 bulb array with a remote power station, only the ballasts need to be mounted so i can save a bit of weight
my idea works
sweet
or what about the ones directly to the bulb
but lets say i use thickass wires, can the 400vdc wires be extended significantly
i know the AC cables can be very long
how long can i make the 400vdc cables reasonably?
<@1246544192058953758>  i had an idea
valid
oh lmao
in this server?
huh?
ü•∞
Now that I know how to do it successfully I could bang one out in a day or two, and I can steal a rectifier and cap from the projector PSU
Cool, I'll look around, might also just buy another projector
Otherwise this will be a compact light
I'll have a look inside at how it's built I guess
Oh like buy the same size and put it into this housing?
I was hoping for like 30km of range
I'm sad it's not higher
now we can see if TSA will let it through
i think ive lived up to torch gollum now
that sucks
yesmaam
but on a 240v ups
dunno if itll work on 120v
wanna buy it when i put it into a proper case
ive got a UPS to run it on
Gonna see if I can take it to a park tomorrow and get some candela measurements and tonight imma point it up
<@1246544192058953758> ITS PARABOLIC üò≠üò≠üò≠
White shouldn't absorb that much light üò≠
My white wall was burning hot after 30s of running
It's crazy
The warm light on startup, the sounds, the brightness
This bulb has so many cool factors
That's so coool
sad
google wont translate it
Also I've got the blower running, should I bother getting this axial fan going too
I wonder what the ticking is when I turn it off
Wiiildd
I put a thermistor in the beam - measured 103C after 15s
Peaked at 290W at one point
We're good
Yeah it's at 270W
i so wanna read that paper thats such a cool diagram
if its 250W rated it should be close to 250W +-20W right, so if i power it on and measure significantly less then ill try swapping
also howd you learn that
any point in trying the otheroptocoppler in case its in low mode tho?
oh damnn
Is it maybe in eco mode and could be brighter?
Is this PWM or a artifact of the square wave it's being driven with?
Thank goooddd
Oh it finally works
Iirc it was salt I outbid for a rot66 he can have it if I die
üòÇ
Wish me luck
Y'all can have my flashlights
So
Don't touch it
Don't stare into it
Don't try turn it on immediately after turning off
Anything else?
Lens, reflector, sheet metal and all
Either stop working or explode iirc, but the bulb is in the original housing
Right on, so the beam on a white wall is probably unsafe
Same as the sun üòÇ
Any issues with looking at the bulb or the beam? I assume the bulb is too intense to be looking at?
Cooling fan is on
I'm all good to try power it on then?
You had me stressed for a minute
Nah it's cool, it's cut off in the photo üòÇ
Just didn't want to get tonnes of solder everywhere
Ah nah I'm not touching that shit
Yeah
I meant would a solder bridge be better than using a wire to connect the pins
Ah hang on
Pins 3 and 4 together
I'm always rubbish at desoldering and tacking wires was easier
Would it be better to solder
yeah, would they be at a high voltage. this is on the logic part of the ballast - i assumed it was all 3.3v /5v stuff
what environment/industry do you work in?
oh gotcha, thats scary asf
the purple shouldnt be - i installed it
the red i know theyre for the UHP bulb
the purple or red?
why cant they be turned off?
all the components blew up
not mine üòé
candlepowerforums.com/threads/my-uhp-project-the-8%E2%82%AC-short-arc.348326/
even this fellaü§®
im not touching it when its powered eeevveer
like how did people on cpf do this in a afternoon by guessing and bodging üò≠
not me plugging everything in from under my granite table
taking a break again
okay, ill check against a cap then
they dont invert it
and the projectors psu would follow red is positive and black is negative?
okay cool, i didnt colour code my stuff
i assume whichever side of the cap is negative is connected to the negative output wire
alrighty
yeah
It was for a 180W (I think) ballast and this is 250W
You sure the old DIY PSU will be okay
Man I'm stressing
Pins 3 and 4
<@1246544192058953758>
do i need to power the board with optocoppers too or just the main 400vdc nput
yea
oh i see, 2 inputs, 1 output
pin one is the LED
2 towards the plug, one away
how wouldi know that from the datasheet?
and do i need to power this board
<@1246544192058953758> could you help me fifure out which optocoppelr to short
The dichroics are so cool
üòÇfrrrr
Cool polarisers
Otherwise I can use the DIY one but I doubt it would work
It has filtering and shid already
So you think the PSU from the projector will turn on without the motherboard
<@1246544192058953758>
and while the battery is in there
can you try holding the button as you screw the light together
and do you have any other lights?
100% sure correct polarity
also cn you check with a multimeter?
if anything?
got a video of what it does when inserted
polarity is right, its charged, the protection circuit isnt broken?
<@231949415273725952> mb for doubting you
hes right
<@544931397048205312>
yeah i dont wanna be a downer but 2x cr123 likely broke it
are you sure. i thought the m200 was 2.5 to 4.2
theres all sorts of different chemistrys that act different, with different pro's con's and voltages
yes, but no
18650 is the size so yes theyre the same size
no because you can get sodium, lithium, lithium phosphate etc etc
Onshape is my beloved üòç
lemme know how it goes for you
50 USD
yall wanna see something cool i made
what else would it be
ü§®
oooooooh
bagh might have your answer, they go urbexing often which i imagine is similar?
i just saw - headlamps are out of my realm tho sorry
tbf its plastic
large die should be easier
ü´°
and maybee the beam will be solid too
it would be siiiick
yeah imma def do pink
so is xml2
sft40 is 5050 right
and then if i dont like it i can put a sft40 later
or ill get a new centering ring and put a pink xml2 in
maybe xpg4?
i forgot about that
JEEEZ
its just slowly burning more
simon refunded me entirely
nah it arrived like this from the factory like a year ago
It's visible in the spot too
When it gives out I'll stick a sft40 in
Blue cslnm slowly dying üò≠

i hate code üò≠
ive got a year and 4 months
should i learn it before uni?
even mech eng?
and finish some flashlight bits
and organise my entire workshop
i wanna do a cf layup
true but i have 0 code knowledge and still have two other projects to do
üò≠
plus university is coming up soon and the more projects i have under my wing the better
lie you get in a videogame but for a room
fun stats
and to plot length of time in room against time of day and day of week
nah itd just be super sick to plot the most commonly walked paths in my room
and then displaying it on a website
id poll every 5s or so ig or make it dynamic maybe
cool - what do you think of using two ultrasonic distance detectors to plot the paths i most frequently walk through my room
pi pico or esp32, either
but imma aska  friend
nor code skill üò≠
have no components on hand
i have 0 clue
chatgpt is my saviour
and show a web page with daily average visits + average visits against time for each day of the week
display number of time i enter my bedroom
motion sensor + LED screen
ive got a good idea tho
dang
hey <@346077022155440140>  
I could make a motion activated light for my stairway
Might be fun to look at and analyse
I was thinking more like a multiples of g's graph in the X and y axis
maybe a accelerometer i could wear would be fun - i could plot a scattergraph of my day
i need help thinking of project ideas

Didn't recognise either driver until someone pointed them out üòÇ
Can't say much about the ac racing tho
Yeah the people here are really great

I'll take a plane over a car anytime
I've almost been in 3 car crashes tho (all minor if they'd happened)
Anecdotally, I've flown at least 8 times a year since I was born 17 years ago - almost all have been transatlantic - and the worst that's happened is there was some mild turbulence and the food cart hit my head as it rolled down the isle
how so?
i might be driving from NC to FL this summer
yup, got a proepr meter now
gonna try this weekend by shorting the new optocopperls

all that
all these have been in my cart for almost 5 months now
i deserve a lil treat
its exam season
the extra 3mm will def make my life easier if it is
17mm?
how big is the d3aa driver
awesome
oh the cheap d4s has aux?
ill dm him later
another thing would be power via host and drill a hole for a wire through the brass insert with a pogo pin to send signals
if i need a custom pcb for the df02 ill probably try copy the d3aa driver and just adapt the size for a df02
lots of mods in the pipeline
cool
i can do that
but odd
fair enough
thats odd
for the power or signal?
but in my head itll be ts10 internals in a df02. aux would still work
i need to check my dimensions first
or do i use a brass post/pipe to extend the brass insert and use a ts10 switch board to carry power and signal and have it connect to a ts10 driver
yeah that fella but i got the full length version
and possibly a convoy driver for the df02 - but im gonna see if i can convert it to eswitch first

IVE GOT 7 NEW LIGHTS ON THE WAY TO ME
It's moved up on my wtb list of lights
It's so much bigger/more imposing than the photos show
Omg 3x21d on the right?
bruh
what game?
wishful vthinking afaik
and machine your own reflector for an upgraded hybrid mule type light
diy or buy the drievr
make some fancy wooden battery tube (internal is metals) and a custom head
find a makerspace and learn how to use a lathe
hows about a full DIY host
slice?
What's the current brightest 3v 3535, What's it get at 6A
Maybe I don't need one then
Hm
Ah so it won't fit into the mf01x
Dang
Oh true
Does the sst25 beat the sanan equivalents
Fc11c? Good runtime, lots of brightness and decent throw
Moar bright less heat üòãüòãüòã
If I'm quick enough I'll probably nab one
if someone had a 5v 50A psu would straight connecting it likely kill the sbt90
Ah okay
Why not the reflector?
Isopropyl rinse?
It's not so much a wrap but it's easy to scratch
Like salty said
Unless it has a airgap between lense and front
I guess the plastic and water are optically similar
Reasonable that it happens
Yeah I mean odd phenomenon
Which is odd
The Z1 didn't break I just mean the lense stopped focusing stuff when underwater
Even the z1 survived tho the lense stopped working
Up to 13ft
I've swam with a lot of my lights
Low pressure sodium lamp
worked for red blue and pink
but it does still show relatively accurately what wavelength it is
Ooh I wanna test it with my dichroics
The spectrum is so cool to see fr
the ui is mildly janky but still impressive
at least i got it working üòé
ah dang, i saw you on the forum
should tide me over
ill put empty organizers back in drawers and sort ouyt the desk and batteries
so that is quite messy
(parents request) to free up space and get rid of junk
but ive taken it all out to make organizers and restructure
nah all the drawers are empty rn so everything at the foot of the bed is from the drawers
theyre going back to their organizers tn
charging run
what parts specifically?
fine
dang it
I'm mid reorganization but I'll likely take a month or so until it's fully finished
Does it need cleaning?

Yeah, they all are capacity tested tho sooo
Lower than my p45b? Maybe I mismeasured the p45b
The first 4 are 20mOhm
Fair enough
Grinding or cutting?
Also, what's the easiest way to grind these down
Is it worth complaining about them being salvage when he's talked about ordering from overseas from the manufacturer
What else should I do for them all?
I'm probably gonna make a trio of matches p42a for a future 3x21d sbt90
What's the best way to record IR, like what current should I charge at, should I scuff the terminal
Will record their IR when I get home

told me im his last un-chargeback-ed order
has promised increasingly larger amounts of batterys if i promise not to cancel
he promised to ship soon ~6 times
basically, i ordered 5 batterys last year october (220 days ago) and have been "harrassing" the seller "gary" every day since
my ~~totally definitely not rocks~~ batteries havent yet arrived, theyll show up tmrw i think

heres everything circled, you missed a disassembled mf01x, ns59v2 head, wuben x3 and sc 31 pro 
everything you ID'ed was correct
lemme go get pics
this is a one off for me, my drawers are a lot more arranged
the the left of the photo is the charge station where the other half of my lights are
i think it obscured but theres a sc31 pro and wuven x3 in frame

Can't tell
Or a stew and toast
Hooked up the amp
I've actually no clue what Itd look like
But I was hoping it'd make a circle
Yeah
But splitting left and right to vertical and horizontal wouldn't be good?
That's fair
Otherwise I'll leave it at one channel
So I was hoping doing left and right would make a cool circle and blob shape
It's a green only
But this is decorative
Probably
Or just vertical for combined LR
For the vertical and horizontal
Should I do separate left and right channels
Gonna try use a old crt as a audio visualiser
should cover all grounds?
new set?
Carry case included
Rough ballpark
How much do y'all reckon I could sell a X3 with a xpg4 in for?

its a arduino pwm- ing a gtfc40 with a fet
L/m//h
i saw a nice desk, microwave and typewriter but thats from my window
but yeah itll look weird either way
vs knocking at 3 and asking
11pm
i mean
but i really dont wanna knock on the door
its gonna look dodgy walking up with a flashlight and taking stuff
i wanna get it but its kinda dark
the house across the road has some cool stuff out next to a dumpster

Review unit üòé
I love this light and got it mega cheap
Sorry not for sale üòò
Cause they're super fragile in my hands
Gotcha, and how easy is it to break the wheels while cutting
Okay gotcha, I'm gonna have to clamp it top to bottom and cut horizontally since I don't have a large enough vice
No something on the aux board died and got super hot, drained the battery's to 2.7V
Okay, I've never used my dremel for cutting before, are there any good guides
A low current battery short, some very improper tooling and a panicked dad over the phone
Gonna replace them with shorter BeCu hanks springs and then lengthen the brass contact
Ignore the bent springs
Nop
Contact the manufacturer to ask for the V2 rail since I have the v1
Use pliers to twist it out
Do I try use a Dremel for the first time to make it a flat head
I've stripped a screw beyond repair in the tailcap of a mf01x
Yup ü§Ø
It's on a mcpcb
Yeah I got the pink XML spare
OHH THEYRE THE SAME THING ü§Øü§Ø
What host are you thinking of, also they survived direct drive with a wurkkos 18350 in case that helps you with max current limits
I think you asked about them a while ago and it slipped my mind
Lemme check, they're x something or other
just saw our mutual servers, i knew i recognised your name!
or like stephen
why not plug it in with a dummy cell and dmm leads
I've only got a link, haven't bought yet sorry. <@410163261137223704>
def buying then
aw sick
not plastic
is it proper metal host?
ooh i was looking at buying one
Ah, ty, I had it wrong then, must've been the older ones you could
Hey <@140540414154375168> do you know roughly how/if a convoy boost driver can be flashed with custom mode spacings

Oop meant to be in modding
I used to pick them up to salvage but I can't keep up
Around north London I usually see 3-4 new ones on my 1.5km walk to school it's so dreadful
Assuming they're both happy to help that covers code and hardware
And wolfgirl
I'd talk to the freeman since he's here
Could probably identify me if you piece every message together
Oh true
Oh gotcha, im not old/ interesting enough for any of those
What sensitive servers exist?
Sounds painfu5
Ouch
Or do they get crutches
Like use their hands to walk
<@130101943639998464> do they move like gorillas then?
Aw man
Why don't they just jump instead of slowing down duhhh
How's that work?

probably üòÆ‚Äçüí®
no clue ac, just been chatting to him about this
lojik7 also ordered and hasnt received

Hey <@551463315919077391> big ol' spark from the NTC thing. Reckon the current is too high?
Replaced it with another 1Mohm but pretty much identical
<@551463315919077391> how is it
Done
Definitely resistors then
Might reinstall a resistor
That's a lot to do with a screwdriver
It'll be 340v
Eek
Also, if I don't install the resistor what do I do to discharge the cap
I'm just tripping breakers which are easy to reset
I know about that but surely it wouldn't stop a fault
10m until I power onnn
Alrighty
Would it be fine without?
If it needs insulation it'll be heat shrink
I think the hot glue gun is out of glue rn
240V AC across this, should I heat shrink
Putting in a new ICL
Yup
No load
This whole circuit should just rectify the AC and charge a cap
See anything?
<@551463315919077391>
Nothing looks shorted here right
God this dmm is unhelpful
I've un ziptied it now
Shid
it's metal?
I thought it was just free form soldering pretty much
I'll go without resistor
Yeah probably. Deadbug it? Or run without resistor?
Heat shrinked and soldered the cap first with reverse voltage and then didn't bother redoing it and swapped the PCB connection
Should be less than a amp when running
pretty sure, ill go google real quick, but if i understand that quote correctly they just mean you need a different cap to use a higher voltage
i almost got the polarity on that cap wrong too üòÖ  assembled it late at night the very first time
i think its okay
its about 2m away from the door
this is a better photo of the pcb, mine came without that small resistor and LED. 
well to be fair, im stood behind a glass door when i power it on and we have a gfci and breaker
in theory its in parralel, same as the capacitor and will slowly drain the cap after power off
yup
idk, i can deadbug the circuit so that im not relying on a pcb to be correctly setup?
what im the 1Mohm resistor isnt actually in parralel
ill wait a couple minutes for the cap to discharge and remove the resistor and check again
but
fairly sure
a few in series maybe?
these small ones cant handle the current
maybe i just need to invest in the fancy meanwell limiter
yup
<@551463315919077391> , looks like the limiter is completely shattered
There's was a spark
It did
Welp
Had me sweating üò≠üò≠
Ohhh I thought you meant it had a clear fault and would poof
Wait so Why'd you say poof?
So it's okay?
<@551463315919077391> !
It's in series to the AC side no?
What why
Why poof?
Did I do it wrong?
Gonna plug just this in
<@194014310555582464> <@551463315919077391>
gonna procrastinate for 10m then get it done
righty ho then
yeah the ntc thingy
on the AC or DC side
do i put it in series to the capacitor or in series to the whole circuit
<@551463315919077391>  its heeere my current limiter arrived
DAMN
450 or best offer
oh i see
lucky bugger
oh huh i thought it sold for 450
too true üíÄ
but i dont really plan on dying so i dont have one rn
ohh true (a will)
well id be dead wouldnt i
but i know a lot of my friends would take one or two for keepsake and the rest would be sold
same
üò¢  i wonder why it was handed down and sold
I'm okay with that
Eh it went for 450
No worries
Alt
I assume they asked since we had someone who was a nuisance get banned and then join on a alg
Oh ok jealous that's so much space
But I don't like using it
Plus a external 2.5tb

That's a bit silly
Doesn't he get that manufacturers lie? ü§®ü§®
whats the beef?

But I don't have the parts for a buffer
And the perfect setup in my 3d printing space
I've got most of the parts for a tradrack
id rather build a tradrack
do you know how many changes that would be üò≠
nop
its the only way i can do dual colour, print separately and recombine later. tho this print is making me want a multimaterial unit
complementary torch?
where am i shipping them?
you can have one of mine
if youre around at dark theyre everywhere
my front garden?
so we're getting excited for that
i found one place earlier this year that said phone back around next week
yeah all the ones nearby only do feeding through fences!!!
she fucking loves cows tho
naw kert wasnt funny
its a glow in the dark cow for my gf
close ü§£
3d printing glow in the dark plastic
especially when talking about throwers
using this to paint a large plastic target would be awesome for beamshots
does it mean camshaft?
i assume cams doesnt mean cameras
are there any examples online
actually, its a good start i guess
true, but would it be as throwy and bright
so whats the easy way
and be mega affordable
since i could go massive massive reflector
but also very cheap
wouldnt be perfect but it wont really matter when im sending 10k lumens downrange
whats each entail?
I want to make a reflector based HID next
But once I'm happy with it I know it'll be easy to reproduce with different hardware
This has been so many months in the making
Don't knock it..I'm very proud of my focusing system
<@551463315919077391>  the frame update (the square beams will be 25mm square tubes joined with the 2nd photo). thisll be cheaper and hopefully easier to centre the beam + focus
uh oh
theyre 25mm not 20 üíÄ
the aluminium extrusion for my project arrived
All my family and friends are east coast
Ah wrong side for me
Then no
I usually take small bits and bobs
Depends on size
What state üòÇ
So I gotta know if it lines up with travel dates
But I visit USA and EU fairly often
It saves me repeatedly asking for countries whenever 3d printing comes up
Oh yeah no point having this if people just fucj around
<@657991318219390979> in the servers I run we use Carl bot role selection and just narrow it down to a continent
can you submerge the peltier?
i always wondered how refusing a parcel really even works with most of my deliverys now been contactless
genuinely
just a hypothetical
oh not trying to
nor would salty
true but i wouldnt gain anything from that
thats fair
then it showed up at my doorstep while i was at work
so i never consented to it
but then when saltyboi sent me a flashlight there was no official agreement that eh would send it to me
this isnt something i actually plan on, more a hypothetical ive always wondered about
so if its a home delivery and they leave it at the doorstep or with a neighbour can i not take it to the PO and tell them i didnt accept the delivery
then itd be half the cost of shipping both ways
could i send it to him, he takes the parcel and does a quick swap of the contents and then takes it to the post office and refuses it and asks to return to sender
if i wanted to ship something to a friend and they anted to ship something to me
cool cool
oh if hes UK ill print one
the bezel tools they have are great for getting lights open
or watch repair
any friends who are into photography?
is he online rn
oooh

I'm gonna make some posters to put around my school for this comp
I've got so many ideas for my bridge and I can't wait to shit all over the competition (metaphorically)
The real question is how much surface area does you print have and would you risk it getting blown off
The cooling at full tilt is 85dba from a meter away with the enclosure closed
On those mini test prints it does 80 degree without much flaw
Just don't trust someone elses GCODE
Ah, If you want it entered tho I'll be slicing it sorry
SS config in case you wanna slice some stuff
sorry man
üòÑ
2 pieces. filament counts as one piece
arachne slicer used so your okay to ho a little under
but the rules say no slabs allowed
but probably hold 2+ people
itd come to around 80g i reckon
this would only be needed for a refined version of my first entry. e.g using a reinforced rod through it and a abs slurry and thicker walls
0.6
might change the weight scoring further to be 15+g over target = -4% per gram added onto the already -30% but imma only add it if i get some silly heavy entry
any infill, any shells, any top/bottom layers
ABS PETG and ABS are allowed
my first idea was using abs rods printed solid with a ABS slurry to connect into slots in a bridge
but feel free to send me a design and ill include you in the results
everything is in there
technically yes but im not setting up a vapour chamber for you
it answers everything
im about to get off my pc but would you read through the ppt if i send it?
ABS
wanna enter?
yeah and their supports under the bridge dont meet at the centre so the plastic flexed and broke around the unsupported section
i sound really condescending saying this but. the smartest person in the group sent me their design to quickly test and it immediately failed at a layer line
wont include in final weight tho
i think i wont specify it and rather let them design and if they need supports then so be it
no need for any supports
theyre allowed 2 parts
what is that too harsh?
and specified by the slicer
no supports allowed in the prints
hows the update rule sound
" theres a weight target of 50g, for each gram above/below this your score will increase/decrease by 2% this is to encourage efficient design and use of material. any designs consisting of an almost entirely solid block will not be qualified"
they shouldve done it in two parts and had it be friction fit together
it also fails along a layer line and a lot of the printed reinforcement does nothing
wasnt my design but id agree
did a 40% speed print of this design so that it wasnt too noisy
layer height dont even matter
ill be printing it
they can tell me what settings they want for weight
ill do the final slice
they arent smart enough for that ü§£
so its still a ratio score but with a limited weight
i think ill have everyone slice a model and decide some settings so that they can get close to 30g +-5g and then do weight held/ bridge weight
how would you calculate a score penalty
ye
how?
so every bridge will be sliced with 10% infill and enough perimiters to bring it to 30g
what if i weight regulate every bridge
oooh <@544931397048205312>
oh i see. since i would be working in kg the bridge weight is going to be a decimal
so the sqrt one
would doing weight held / sqrt bridge weight be good
or  weight held / (6 X bridge weight)
i do!
pre or post slicing?
but it would massively increase the score for anything under 20
that way it punishes anything over 20g
i was thinking scoring like this
oh true
how can i add more weight slowly
gonna test my friends design soon but i think itll survive
i need worse quality filament for this üò≠
rn the scores are based on weight held/bridge weight and i scoredd 933. oh dear
really good shit as in good garbage or good quality
yeah i just dont have any to hand
and ive never run a club
none of them are particularly skilled in anything
for 17 year olds
something that punishes a weight over 20g maybe for eavh gram
gonna need to make a little mathy equation to score the bridges
i had to jump on it 4 times to break
a 60g print was able to hold 50kg easily
they hold much more weight than i thought
small issue
I can't remember if that's on super slicer or orcaslicer
Ohhh yeah o gotcha the CNCkitchen thingy
But what do you mean
I kinda think i know what you mean
Huh?
how about. does the opposed layer lines idea sound stupid?
did you eat during the day? /s
i really like my idea of opposing layers so i might just go for it. but i figured its good to ask
is it really cheating
so
i created the challenge?
i meannn
And gotta be pla or abs
Forgot to mention. It's a weight to performance ratio that it's scored with
I'm thinking have a part embedded in another printed with a 90 degree offset so that the layer lines reinforce eachother
What would you do
If you had to design a 200mm long bridge to be 3d printed that needs to hold as much weight as possible (can only be two parts maximum)
It sounds fairly standard
Not in a rude way, but what's special about that
That's interesting
Ah gotcha
or is there something driving it
massive gitd plastic?
Wait what even is it?
Dang not even for like a week, id be glad to carry some boxes icl
Otherwise I'll find any old engineering place
Trying to find work experience and it would be a sick place to go

ouh
agh i cant, its like a s2, no bezel
will acetone damage anything?
also i think i see flashing pads but im not sure, theyre unlabelled, i need to get out my acetone and try unglueing this
how do i access it tho?
5c then 1c to cycle to the mode
is that 10c 1c 1c
i gotta turn on mode memory
and i wish rgb aux wasnt the first mode it turned on to
ive no clue how to get in there
ive got everything exccept the top right box figured out
cool aesthetic with my purple wrap
but
no waterproofing
yeah
completely rubish

ive set the temp regulation to 60c
making progress on the UI tho
driver wont budge
retaining ring out
hm
sad
but i cant unscrew the retainer
i can get the inner tube out (which gives enough dia for a 18650 but its not long enough)
the tailswitch has some wobble
sooo
ooh thats interesting
oh no üò≠
Each of the 3 aux led can turn on at different times and with different colours
I'll take it out in a bit and have a looksie
It can control each aux independently for every colour
I assume so
That was cool
I got to a mode where the aux was red only and spun around in circles
That makes more sense
Ah my battery must be dead
Right as I walked out my house the delivery was there
Yup
It's got sst20 2700k
But yeah maybe convoy buck
It's got a spiny thingy
The aux modes are sick
It is pretty cool thooo
Sick aesthetic tho
No clue what the UI is

its a absolute beaut
the thing was built by a friend

yuuup
Ah the one is for Google maps the other is just how my mum holds her phone
That's fair
Ahhh
Oh that's a sweet upgrade
Whats the swap
That's what a good friend would do üòÇ
Of course not
I kinda wanna make a 50k lumen monster with a 500W HID and stick it in the biggest reflector shaped object I can find
So I can direct drive LFP
Thankfully HID only need 36v max
Take it or leave it
I can do 5?
I dony think I can click fast enough üòÇ
Ah okay
I've got very little knowledge in this kinda stuff
Is that serious?
wanna hear my current setup
i might pivot away from these UHP bulbs and back to HID since they seem easier to power
i do have one large cap in there rn but ive no clue how effective it is
nah not really, itll be fed into a ballast which will deal with it i hooe
what i have now works tho
200w 320v
200+
yippeee
other way 16 to 320
ill take cheap and inneficient
idk about HID bulbs tho
thats for UHP bulbs
or some other method
wether thats an inverter then rectifier
when i get a lfp battery ill just get a higher voltage one and find a way to take it up to 320vdc
ahh smart
will my local river work okay
yessir
but for now im okay with lead acid
basically, ill be back in a couple months for your help stephen/danchp
oh well. if i invest properly in a lfp i can buy a charger
once im tired of breaking my back to carry it ill invest in lfp
just to check though, a lfp battery is a straight drop in for the lead acid UPS
basically, this searchlight is my first step into super throwers. once i become comfortable in my skill im happy to invest in a nice lfp to power my future planned HID and xenon arc and UHP bulb searchlights
i thought you meant the lfp will gain capacity ü§£
oh gotcha
wdym
i think ill run this lead acid dead and then re evaluate once the project is finished
for now im okay since that only gives 10m extra runtime
estimated runtime of 20 minutes üíÄ
welp
oh dear
if i go all in on a large large searchlight id completely change the design and go for different parts anyways so im not too bothered
meh
it is what it is
but considering i got the UPS free and the battery is hella cheap
yeah that figures for this UPS
if i were to redo this project id def use a lfp battery and a more powerful bulb. but for now this light isnt needed for long runtimes
maybe as a future upgrade but rn this is more a proof of concept
oof cost
im running a 200W circuit off a 12V 7AH battery
like what can i expect in cycle life
how bad is it
thats not great
ah
just figured for efficiency sake
if not ill just stick my ac-dc 12v wall wart onto the UPS output
i thought they went to 0V
is that a problem for lead acid batteries
<@551463315919077391> no reason i cant do this right?

ooh
ask in the comments ü§£
but develop what?
to power what tho?
ive been told by my school to run a engineering club, whats a good project for 10-15 people whove never created anything before to start with, we have a budget of around ¬£100, preferably itd be something that each person could take home but it could be 1 large thing or like 3 people per thing made. originally we tried doing robot wars but no one is experienced enough to know how to start so it kinda fell apart
Ah nice
what is it?
Sure üòé
Hey <@187022199838736384> still down for that switch?

we could probably organise it with them no
i vote we host in london
itd be so cool

<@551463315919077391>  opinions on the dm1.12?
Iirc it's just brass black that's washed on
Sorry man
If I buy a new pair of ts10 and sp10 for the swap specifically I'd try it
Hey <@187022199838736384> I went to do the swap but the ts10 and sp10 pro mcpcbs have their wires in different locations so I couldn't figure out a way to get them to work together without just drilling new holes which I don't wanna do for a silly mod
For charging then any magnet wood work, inside lights I use copper rods
Inside a light or for charging?
proper british brekkie
the kncockoff ones from silver ingot are around 20 no?
ooh
nevermind then
ah rip
you should use it for the thermal interface
whats that phase transfer thermal pad thingy
ah my intent was never for easily swapping, just for a long range BEACON
ewww on which half
yeah i was looking at them for a searchlight but luna talked me into using a uhp bulb
ahh cool
and the phlatlight is the directly bnded die module thingies

its getting returned, its a internal issue
I think it died
And it's getting 5.0
Nah usb c powered so it'll pick what it wants
But absolutely burns to touch
It plays music
I'll continue testing but return it ig
I've got no clue
But it boots
It's get really fucking hot
Hm
I've genuinely done nothing to make it die
Why
And now it gets super hot for no reason
I plugged it in twice
Bruh wtf this dfplayer just killed itself
Usually I'd just connect to the +- pads but this only accepts USBC compliant plugs
Eh I need a usb c output to the board
Does it ouput via that port?
It works well enough
For now I'm using this
Yeah I am but I worry about overdraining
Though I don't know how it handles voltage input to its pins and wether that'd require 3.3v
I was thinking 9v down to 5v for the servo tester and it could power my dfplayer too
but something small would be nice
otherwise ive got a phat nimh battery ill run it on
i can do a 9v stepdown
you can just select the role in welcome üòÖ , i figure if ive got a rare torch, do reflows, am building a searchlight and have made and sold custom finished lights and done a few comissions
dfrobot.com/product-2232.html
i have this board and need to find a way to either power it off a alkaline battery or find a way to get power via USB to a servo tester board
so i can either configure it so the alkaline battery supply's power to this board and the servo tester OR usbc power the board and piggyback the servo tester off the board
which would be best
same thing no?
hes the best fr fr

np, the people there are great, try @daalegard the mans great at this stuff
48v steppers and why they have more torque
ask around in misc3d printer or the speedbenchy channel
its a big topic over in 
its to do with back emf, having a higher voltage decreases the proportion of voltage lost in the windings and decreases the time for the magnetic field to saturate or something

in which case thisd be easiest, and i can program via usb?
so presumably itll output directly to my passive amp
<@410163261137223704> it mentions a DAC in the description
hang on
ah okay
okay so id be best off with esp32
id rather pay for that external dac
thats pretty bad for what i need it for
ehh
and thats it
so to triple check
i need the passive amp, arduino nano, micro sd card reader and a speaker
cool üëç
sorry im very unfamiliar with this side of electronics
or?
for the passive booster thing
my brothers good at it?
coding?
ive got one i think, NCP2890 audio amplifier IC
ill use the nano to output a digital audio signal and then use the board to connect to a speaker
hey <@410163261137223704> , which module would work with arduino nano adafruit.com/product/935
then im all good]
dac +arduino nano for audio
so pwm output to the servo for speed controll
cool
i see that now
i do need continuous 360 rotation tho
i was just gonna connect 5v to the motor directly
and then use the arduino for sound
cool cool, ill probably lobotomise a servo and directly wire to its motor
so i figure, ¬£5 arduino nano + dac + micro sd reader
rn ive got nothing
ooh i said cheapest
where?
<@410163261137223704> would this work with a arduino nano
iirc servos are pwm right?
im also loading funky town on there
this but the audio wont come out of a computer, just a speaker running off the mcu
and ive got a amp
sound quality doesn't matter
hey <@410163261137223704> whats gonna be my cheapest option to spin a servo and output a analog sound signal from a wav on a microsd
ah fine, microsd it is
im not sure sorry
anyone know if its doable via a usb drive
i found a guide shoing how to play audio via a microsd card
its quite cool
im trying out some arduino based projects for the first time
Hm jy doesn't show up for this server
gotcha
ohhh
wdym, in a kettle lead?
I know I'm dumb and I try be humble about it yk
üòÇ
They mean generally in any other server where the admin isn't as lax you would've at least been warned for the negative attitude constantly
Gifs and as text
Nah in the general chats around here
Generally just not a nice attitude
He keeps sending something about people yapping
yup, just hoping for a bright light that he doesnt need to charge regularly since hes prbably not a fan of that
otherwise ive got my wuben x3 spare
yup, w2 boosted d4k
not a maam
guh
im getting my bro a torch for urbex which im excited for since hes never been super into the hobby
BUT
rude
their newest one, "worlds biggest power plant" section
ah okay just similar aesthetic and colouring on the machines then
where is that, watching broken window theory rn and it looks similar to their vid
plus w2 will have far more lumens
and i wanna treat him right yk
i can afford that
its only 20 dollars more for d4k vs sp33
true
gotta pay for it
lemme see what shifts are available üòÖ
cool, hs10 + boost w2 d4k
for the w2
reckon a boost driver is worth getting
man thats sick
thanks bagh
hes determined to only have 2 smallish lights. so im thinking d4k w2 for efficiency over the 519a (hes not a snob) and a c8 with sft40 like you said
and whats a decent headlight, ive never been into that market
in which case, d1k sfn60 or d4k w2 or something else
yeah he mentioned the red light on the nextorch K25 that i gave him is good for stealth. but i reckon thats because its the only way to get directly to a dim light
hey <@458297028028399626> just getting a urbexer opinion, what do you think of a d4k sst20 DR and w2. for my brother who wants to start urbex. ill keep it for a bit as my first hank then send it off to him
a wk40 driver, some bodging and a l21a and a suitable TIR you could probably recreate it
oh okay, im niot familiar with olight i was wondering if they have a certain set of features for each line
also i was right, heads got swirly notches
howd you know
yk how the thor pro iirc was for businesses only not independents, do you think olight does that too
it looks like swirly divots
yeah youre right, disagree on the head though
looks like this minus the ring
<@458297028028399626> 
nvm
variant of the seeker?
do you know if its multi emmiter
<@140540414154375168> just a thought, but if you 3d printed a oversized large parabolic mirror, created a negative of the final volume needed then printed that and use it to sand the reflectors surface smooth. then cerakoted it and then used magnetron sputtering to coat it. you could fairly easily create large reflectors. or do all that minus the cerakote and sputtering and use those spray on silver mirror solutions
oh dear
dont die
good luck
its terrible
they scream like women getting beat up outside my window when they have sex
foxes can do that
gl dawg
fair, but it occured to me you should know it for any future expeditions
<@1039049406936268840> do you know first aid
howd you find it
good luck
im still growning so each pair only gets worn for a year or so
ah okay
and i edc a s21d with clip, loop earplugs, wallet and headphones in one pocket and phone in the other
none of my clothes are even worn around the pocket]
howd it create a hole
what phone?
i havent gotten mine yet
not sure but did you get tracking
Having one ring around the perimeter and on top and bottom
I reckon a floating glass lense would be pretty tough except for direct on hits where it's the same as normal glass
because i always thought it was the v3
hey <@140540414154375168> found your comment on the sp10 series, is it the sp10 pro with buck boost?
i might save up and dio a big haul from him
yah haha he got me my UV yingfeng
is there any 3535 LED that does pc yellow or mono yellow preferably
idk actually, someone somewhere mustve
also, can someone remind me, which sp10 has a buck
just for fucky colour business, otherwise id get my other lights
then id be content
i want a wk40 with a red green, blue and amber or lime mono LED
ah gotcha, whats it for the other way, when it is mono
i can never remeber if pc is normal run of the mill coloured stuff or if its the mega nice type that everyone loves for green LEDs
oh wait is it a normal LED
i want one for a sp10 pro
hey <@721757010172969031> whered you get the pc amber
cpt nemo when ms18
and who doesnt want a ms32
flashlight money is flashlight money
CAN YOU BLAME HIM
Gimme a sec, might've sorted it, might not
hey <@140540414154375168> odd request but do you know linux
I kinda guessed where everything went
The arc won't light but the status led works
Does any of this look really wrong
I'm tryna repair a arc lighter I found
Yo
where in your settings can you view it
spend it before you can tell yourself its a bad idea
rookie error
nah not sofirn, cyberwerks
thats quite a step up
you know what imma go threaten chargeback again
its my order of batteries and ive got like 4 more lights arriving soon üò≠ gonna need them batteries
womp womp
13
one sec
might be more than ten
actually
hah at this point im just waiting it out
week 10
where did you find that graph
im at 384gb
And I know their runtimes roughly
I charge them before I need to use the light
Nah not really
yeah theres really only 4 combos i use regularly. lockout for night time, turbo, ramp up and ramp down
hes hoping nc
my brothers there now for uni and his top priority is moving too
ah yeah thats all fair points
of all states
and why the state you live in
how come
if you dont mind me asking
you moved to the US?
if youre UK, b&q sell it
caustic soda is the active ingredient iirc
watcha up to
yo
Yeah it was a old unit pre SI
Mod it for a HID bulb and get even more throw
They bang loudly on my doorstep and scream
Womp womp
UV l21a lasts for about one 20m walk before lvp
Got any way to measure the thread?
To remove a S2 driver you have to desolder it around the edges right?
Also
Just try everything you own?
lego?
or just looking at the driver
what about a opple flicker graph
i wonder how many are legit tho
yeah ik a lot ebikes get recycled like that
sadge
ooh got a link to that
i thought it was all theoretical
i dont know if they ever did actually steal did they
iirc kicked and then one of the higher ups dropped a msg in the announcement channel
but
true
its like the guy who detailed how to steal batteries from ebikes
are you planning on stealing from cars???
but then i saw the title
i had a look at your amazon wishlist üòÜ . from the first few items it looks like youre planning on robbing cars
nice nice, thats def a solid light
i got my first light around your age
aw sick, watcha getting
you new to collecting flashlights>?
Polycarb Fresnel should solve that
Okay cool
Nah completely open
sorry to keep asking, but should i be targeting that gap or from the front aim into the reflector
darn okay
or do i need to target the actual glass where the light comes out
is it okay to blow air over the back of the bulb/reflector
<@551463315919077391> before i lock in to one cooling solution
I don't know üò≠üò≠
My girlfriends mum who's blind was gifted a flashlight üòÇ

Still working on sourcing spade connectors
<@551463315919077391> first prototype lense holder
awesome ty
i dont see why not but i wanna double check
on a pc
can i use it as a second monitor
if i buy this Ruige TL-S500HD screen
anyone here going to smrrf
oopsie ye
eh i dont wanna risk it, rather not have my bulb melt
is it?
and heat resistant enough
tupperware isnt big enough
my frien fell through
still gotta order some cnc parts from jlcpcb
hah no
nerves ----> procrastination
havent done the crimps yet
sooo
none atm im still really nervous about powering it on
hey <@551463315919077391> should i worry about arcing at the recitifier pcb otuput for 320v dc
3x of the yingfeng 25W uv LED
3x21d
hear ME out
25W UV LED otw üòé
jumped when i saw TK up there
hahahahaha ü§£
I even did it all fancy with heatsgrink
Ezpz
I'll just swap it on the pcb
Google lied
üíÄ
The thick band 8s the positive
I even googled
Wait I got it wrong?
Gonna zip tie the board to the cap
At this point I've soldered the PCB to the cap not the Other Way round
Ah cool
How do you get both legs hot enough to fully push them down
Awesome
It's tough having both legs hot to push it down
Hey <@551463315919077391>  1-10 how's this
like they have in texas
eventually id love to organise a UK flashlight meetup
its nice to see other UK flashlight enthusiasts
cool
ah not too far off
london?
woo! another brit üòé
they have some bulk cause the flipabble part
oop nvm
from target
theyre the all in motion brand
i bought this banger pair, they have flip over mitts that are held down by magnets
USA right?
I don't know if I'd organise it tho
Is be down to go
couldnt get my CU open tho
i did it to my TI
and it makes it a little less sloppy
you can open it up and put a little tape over the nub
okay so now im definitely less wary of buying the wrong type of bulb +reflector
yeah! that was so intense
theyre so small too
thats awesome
aw whatttt
then who owns that fresnel uhp
whats a normal uhp thrower
waittt
the uhp bulb is 9k lumens and 450Mcd right?
damnnn
no! thats so cool!
plus i cant remeber bust isnt it you with the tank searchlight
yeah! youve got the uhp bulb light!!
oooh! you have so much cool stuff
but a larger led at the same power wont really make much difference
depends, more surace area and more thermal mass meakes it easier to sustain more lumens at a given temp
im tryna source a UHP bulb still
or like luna made, a UHP bulb and a phatttt fresnel lens
think bigger
wall power for sure
Or that sbt90 thrower
The Mach 1?
What about that 46950 light
Ooh
Titanium something
E switch signalling tube?
Funky
Light mode profile page
üòé
yup
im visitng in a couple weeks
at least my pink xml2 arrive soon
im even lookin in the USA
keeping my eyes open though
and my teachers havent gotten back to me
no üò≠  ive missed 3 different auctions while at school
safer than HF for sure
you should acid etch it but you dont have to
i want a plain band to electro anodise myself
anyone know a good alix seller for actual titanium ringsd
also
i dont mind it so much tbh
new ui on AliX
Not too shabby for a first try
Now to figure out why electro anodising isn't working
Probably not I'm just weak
There's some minor scratches
Used a hairdryer and pliers
All done
Tips
Any tipa
Is that optional üò≠
How do you get the ts10 ti tail cap off
Maybe I'll do a driver and emitter swap
It's moonlight is a lot brighter than the tits10 too
Anduril 2
Ughhh really
Why's it flash after 1c from moonlight
cant get it off
damn hows the ts10 ti tail glued down
its anduril 2
ohhh
extra funky cause my brats10 just puts the aux into blinky
funky
id reflash this ts10, BUT I AM NOT GOING BACK TO THAT SOIC8 CLIP
whats the anduril 1 clicks for ramp config 
imma make the switch a diff colour
ez pz
oh thats fine, and re assembly just screw it together
is it a bad idea to dissasemble the tailcap
eh maybe its normal and im just picky
WAAATTT
MAO TS10??
if i apply a little sideways force, the titanium feels like it clicks twice (bur ig)
both new
cause the button press on my brass one feels a lot smoother than titanium
hey <@140540414154375168> do you have a brass ts10
also, lower current = slower process right?
any clue how to get that single band one colour and then paint a mix of other colours evrywhere else
im tryna figure out how to get the inner heatsink rings one colour and get evrything else a mix of painted on colours
also, i just ordered everything to anodise it tmrw
maybe i just need to clean with alcohol
does it feel sticky to you?
but im uper particular about textures
but sandblasted TI feels almost grimy to me to hold
its tastefully smooth and sharp
most anodised alum isnt like that
yeah
it feels sticky to hold
im 50/50 on this sandblast finish
you da best
thank you snake
ahhh
hahah
ive got a ball pein on the way to custom hammer this lil dud
also my order came with 3 ts10 cips, one ?sc31? size clip and some other random clip
whats up with the TI aux tho, they flash blue after it turns off
YIPPEEE

<@551463315919077391>  hows this for 120, UHM bulb
why dont they say
awww whattt
but gotcha
thats confusing
ahhh
awesome, so ill keep an eye out for a elliptical reflector and a 200+W UHP bulb
nah i want max throw
ah okay, do you not remove the reflector anyways?
is it purely the bulb power that matters and nothing else
do you know a whole lot about projectors, would a short range one work?
awesome
ahhh okay you outright bought one
hey <@551463315919077391> where did you find your UHP bulb?
nah the driver is screwed down with 3 screws which also hold down a alum plate and a plastic plate
it took a lot of fanagling to get on
sorry i dont wanna take the cover off again
ahhh
which one
sorry, got caught up at work
ooh whos custom is it
but thats good
but the aux work - dimly albeit
eventually i should
idk if ill flash the multichannel
and everything works great
yup, after the minor fucked AUX i yolo'd it and reassembled
exactly what someone said!
someone said they were properly flash blinded for a bi
they got blinded üòé
so
they wanted me to turbo them
and wanted to see how bright it was
my class at school was asking about the mf01x as i was talking about modding it
Lucky
Woah
Oh wait nkon?
Damn where do you work that has spare LEPs
rah
north london
yup
250 up and down
got fiber recently
nuh uh
Also does anyone know how to contact astrolux, I'm tryna get my hands on the V2 tailcap for the mf01x
I'll be quick on the hw
Thank you üôè
Slogging through homework currently
Spent the night at synagogue
Sadly not üò≠
It's a mf01x head
So one board comes out on its own
Are you sure, I thought it was a double driver
Hey <@551463315919077391> I've got it loose but can't pull it past the threads
Smart
Ah I see that now
It's a 2 layer driver so I'm hoping the important stuff is visible without
Do I need to desolder the switch
I'm not sure how to actually disassemble this torch
Also what's the best reflashing guide
I'll probably solder more wires to the mcpcb too and reapply thermal paste while I'm at it
To solder the new one a iron is okay right
At work rn but I'll disassemble when I'm home
50 dollars plus a lumintop GTA and shockli batt
Bought the review model for mega cheap!
That was from reversed polarity in a parallel setup tho tbf
Hahaha that's mine
Do you know if Amazon is okay for buying FETs, I don't wanna wait agrs
So maybe I should try pop open the driver, buy 2 high power fets and stack them
The mf01x severely underperformed compared to what a spec sheet says
Oh interesting
How do you add a second fet, also would a fet swap to something better specced help
i was happy to pay (just wanted to save shipping) dawg chucks in a silver clip even though theyre oos
i love wurkkos support
ü§£
me:
Hi, can you please include a black or silver clip for ts10, I can pay

Manager:
Hi
No problem, sir
I have added one balck and one sliver clip to your package
üôÇ

Me:
thank you so much!!
electromagnetism üòé
change the frequency and see if the haptic changes too
easy way to test would be tactical strobe then
try without the magnetic tailcap
maybe the big drop in current makes the battery jump as its no longer such a strong electromagnet
magnetic tailcap?
I was eyeing up a listing on edc exchange for a c57
Did you get it off reddit
That's fair
Ohh true
Other than cool
Any justification for wanting that
Fun, but not much use for a LEP tho
Ooohh
Boom
Wire switch to the top
Stick sawed off lep into back
Buy a huge Fresnel lens off alix
Even if just to rip apart and make a janky mega LEP
I wonder what happens to them
I can't imagine they'd manually disassemble and fix the old lights
I wonder if you ask to pay a small fee they'd send the replacement and let you keep the old model
How much would you sell it for, I might have the perfect use
Oooohh
Ah snake says yes, what LEDs did you get i might be interested in buying one
<@140540414154375168> do you know if the ns14 and ns59v2 heads are interchangeable
100% sure
I'm finally replacing the magnets
For my ns59
Is a brass spacer okay Vs a copper spacer
Next imma try custom fw for a hourly changing aux
I've finally got a use for lockout
<@137363644932423680> thank you for helping with anduril, I've finally got the light setup perfectly
Oh gotcha
While you're here, is there a way to make the aux change colour every hour or after every time the light turns off
Also
I'll do mode memory and set the stepped ramp to 50 and lifes perfect
Awesome that's perfect
Cause I want 1h on lockout to be moon but 2h to be 50/150
And are stepped and smooth ramp floors separate settings
Does the 2h on lockout on anduril 2 use the brightness of the floor ramp
Yo
It's not too painful either
Oh yeah
It wasnt too bad
I set my Thor 3 on a tripod and walked 50m away before stepping in front of the beam
Just a measurement tool
Not a chrager
What's a good tool to measure batteries internal resistance
I'll be in the UK in 2 weeks and might have a spare there, otherwise email sofirn
It's just a rubber barb holding it
Should be able to take it off and put a new one in
He took purchase and video requests, replies to every comment, shows comparisons and uploaded daily
I loved his videos
That's awful
Some comments on his yt channel say so too
Is smothered chrome dead
Holy shit
Free stuffüòç
üò≠
Same
Account must be older than and have commented before the post
Damn
Damn maybe I should get for my mf01x
Huh, 60A CDR?
Where from
The lishen?
and pick up a spare 40t for my other lights
yeah its for the mf01x so ill get p45b
üòì
misread
also, 18650 batt store for US purchases right?
cause itll save me 10 quid
other than capacity is the p45b worth it over p45a
oopsie
ns59 switched on turbo
had a incident on the tube today
nah 807?
and freinds who go to parties regularly and just dont drink at all
in the uk
i have freinds whove been drinking since 13
mericaaa
Ive got a job finally and need something to save for, what would you recommend
<@140540414154375168> you've got a lot of the mega expensive big boy lights, right?
but
fair
id take that ez pz
if the highs work fine
bro
Yeh
Ugh I keep slicing my thumb on my convoy clip üíÄ
S21d
Not worth it then
Cool
Ones flat ones beaddd
They're the same model
Assuming same angle
Or is it a beam profile difference
Does a beaded Vs flat TIR increase throw
Relay too
is there glass over the optic?
i did it for my s2+ <@458297028028399626>
thats been my strat
go unfrosted and sand with very fine grit later if need be
probably power and throw
üíÄ
although idk which LED for sure yet
and cyan aluminium body
519a or w2 in a d4k/d4v2 with a copper head
ive finally decided what i want from hank
iirc hes got a custom driver
I'll get to it this weekend, but imma try chuck a blue 7070 led in
I have an idea
Actually üòè
Rip
All led in parallel?
3v output?
Hm
Is is particularly good? What's it's voltage output
I've got one spare
What's the if25a driver good for
Just got confused by the m2 Vs m1
Cool
31.8mm?
from this listing, how big is the m21b glass lens
also
cool, time to figure out flashing
ammeter connected to led pads and just start ramping? until it reaches the max acceptable current?? but then how do i set that as max
also if i chuck a pink xpe into the sofirn sc21 how do i choose max ramp to stop it burning out?
can the opple 3 be used as a lux meter to record runtimes
I woul never turn it on, skim cancer and eye damage terrify me
im a bit miffed it wasnt a high power light, since i already have a perfect edc, but the light is quite nifty
the nextorch k25
ooh i won one of those
üíÄ
Could do a home assistant thing with a esp32, relay and a AC cob
discord threads
<@721757010172969031> what country
Yeah at the entry level that's probably gonna be perfect
ive got a 1.4k all cnc aluminium printer sat unassembled behind me rn, the vzbot. its a absolute beast
not too shabby for a entry level
ahhh
ender 3
OH what printer do you have
oooh the physics playground app does the same thing
its a shame ill have to leave my phone for so long tho
ooh i can use excel ez pz, lemme look into that app
and should i start at the highest mode?
should i be monitoring it for safety
i dont think ive ever ran a light to empty
these two together and i could make a respectable review
managed to get double pay today for 3 hours, so ive got 60 to blow on measuring tools
now that i have a job its affordable i guess
the markup isnt thaaat bad
quick search has this place
4x the price üò≠
opple sorry
it seems the aliex store doesnt sell to the uk anymore
cheers
is the opple 4 worth it over the 3
lovely
yeah im trying to keep it cheap, whats a okay tool for relative output
ah so it doesnt need to be lumen measurement, just a box and measure change
i love it, i havent had any issues although i do coddle it as its my only LED, only complaint is the knurling is quite sharp. otherwise the beam is beatiful, throw is plentiful and it looks hella pretty. i might buy a thor 1 just because its so small
as well as personal impresions
is there anything else i should include
alright, i think key things to include would be, teardown at least to remove reflector. beamshots in varied locations, white wall, UI review and spec overview
i already have one in hand, i might try ask for a right angle something
ill give it a try, so far on my to do list is, (that i own)
sofirn: sc31 pro, sc18, if25a
convoy: l21b, z1, c8+, s2+
lumintop: thor 3
nightwatch: ns59v2
nexxtorch: k25
 once i clear those those and get them posted ill start the search for a freebie
thats the dream man
i started watching this guy smothered chrome on yt. hes either insanely rich, irresponsible with money or gets sent truckloads of lights
aw thanks, ill post them here when theyre finished
but we'll see ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
said every enthusiast ever
its just always been a dream
not rude at all, currently none. maybe itll stay that way
ill rezch out to them, who else is budget. wurkkos?
but id also like to see who i can contact to increase my collection
now that i have the summer off ill start
ive been meaning to upload all of my currently owned lights
ill review them on youtube and all that
to chuck goofy LEDs into
cause i kinda want a free host
also, anyone know what brand would be most likely to send out lights to review
id only ever want to get it to chuck in front of a huuuge fresnel
thanks all
sick
would you use solder to connect the led to your heatsink
i can hand solder that
i was so confused
that makes more sense
is that possible??
these all caught my eye
its got 95cri apparently, 3000k
fatass LED i found while browsing some obscure aliexpress store
is 18.5mm x 18.5 mm a standard footprint
hey quick qestion
Ohh it's not targeted
L
Actually, I guess a hotrod does need alum
Even in looks?
Any colour you're partial to, personally I like the green but the cyan is classic
But getting a d4k and two d1v2 is appealing
I thought the copper and shiny metal looked nice
Ohh are you not a fan of ti
Or if you have a suggestion
I've got my first paycheck and I want some really pretty edc
Something firefly
Or
2 d1s one with b35am and one with w1 + a alum d4v2 with any LED
Or
D4v2/d4k ti (I have no clue what LED just yet)
But
Oops, work stuff called
In your opinion
Hey griz
The Messiah üëã
a d4v2 TI
or
if i get from hank itll either be 2x d1v2 and a alum d4k
im between something from jack, hank or adair custom ts10
thank you for the reccomendation üôè  im gettibng my first paycheck soon
are those coloured or white light only
awesome
yeah and i dont know of many ts10 mods
i can also order a mcpcb from jlpcb that allows the aux to stay too
but coloured ts10 i think would be sick
im just getting some options set out
im not to set on what LED tbh
i think theyd be cool
like one green, red, blue and pink
would a set of ts10 with different coloured xpe be stupid
also
or is just the longer wavelength that needs germanium
hows the c8+ with ir led work ?
ty
ahh
Like could I use it to heat stuff
Would it be like a remote heater at all?
And what's the danger
What's the use for a high power IR emitter
ooh or the if25a is quite nice
its still okay
ive dunked my sc31 pro in a pool quite a few times and dropped in a river, and in the rain
^^^^
sideswitvh id judt the location, personally i find them easier to use, anduril is the firmware like snake said^^^
yup, grab the included battery too, its pretty good. if you need longer runtimes tho or a little more light take a look at the ts series from wurkkos theyve got a couple 21700 size lights whichll have higher capacity batteries
i dont know of any mechanical switch lights with built in charging
and again, personal preference, id get a sideswitch anduril light
theyll all be well under 50
or any of the fc series by wurkkos
most sofirn and wurkkos lights will be fine for what you need, personally id grab a sc31 pro or almost any of the ts series by wurkkos
yup thats standard
but what he said might change that ^^
ts22 is pretty good all round
You can change mode too if you're quick
and a diy wavien for efficiency
and you could just swap one phosphor for another (i say this with no knowledge of how the phosphor is made)
an aliex store sells the parts assembled and as a kit
Well wire did
Gotta get a charger with a checker
I haven't checked the IR yet but I'd bet so
It was shorted long enough to catch fire
üíÄüíÄ
And the light never gets near a dangerous temp for a battery
He was not pleased
My dad was the one who shorted it
And they were fresh off the charger
16 üò≠
The actual batterie isn't swollen
I've shorted out the special lishen batteries with 60A discharge and all that happened was my cable melted
And maybe blue I think (I can't remember)
It's got green and red
Can I make my sc31 pro buttons led colour tied to my batt voltage
uh oh
<@140540414154375168> How'd you get Herbart deal with them for the flashlight
so they just chucked it onboard
maybe the stars aligned and it arrived right before planes were leaving??
anyone have opinions on it
might swap out the emitter in my sc31 pro to use the 3v xhp50
im always wary about my switches letting in water
Uk
Had a 6 day order
He must've changed something
My last three Simon orders arrived in less than 10 days after purchase
ooooh
but i cant remember
i think another batch of bozzle is in the works
ahh fair enough
Or vzbot Goliath ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Get yourself a nice bozzle
Got a nextroch k40 instead
I argued anything can start a fire but they weren't having it
Since I'm not allowed something that could "start a fire"
Showed my geography teacher my sc31 pro (he's a avid camper) and next day got called into vice principals office
Lucky
Damn
In school?
outer or inner metal?
How can I get that plastic off
I thought it was a bottle cap for a sec
Ooh very nice
Where's the rest of the light
dual output light duty 4 pin wiring loom
diode dynamics has those
ooh actually
im trying to get the zoom threads greased
<@137363644932423680> howd you get the z1 open
Anyone got a model
Might 3d print a light saber handle for it
It really feels like it too
Fuck yeah üòé
Dunno if it's narrow band tho
It's a blue one
Should I clean off that tiny piece of Shmoo on the led
awesomne! i couldnt find where the bezel started üòÖ
saw your comment on reddit
hey <@137363644932423680> from where do you loosen the bezel?
when fully zoomed
the fog cleared under the lens but it still appears to have spill and is of center
Also does this guy have the 12 group driver?
And I just wanted to check on the beamshot if it's centered right
The fog in the lens I assume is what makes all that spill
Just got my blue z1
<@650091340868223070>  you were mentioned just yesterday
Dude what a coincidence
But I get back Tuesday
Cool, I'm in the USA for a little bit
White or clear, I've got a clear petg, translucent gitd white pla, white pla
Whatchu need, colour and model
Yup
Anything for a flashlight homie
Same (if the UK is any nearer)
Like go the other way around the earth
Wdym?
Might be time I figured out how to flash my lights
Wait there's forks of anduril??
careful lad
illegal in texas
love
sorry to ask you 007j could you ask if thats a option
oh yeah
thats my plan
id buy a ton of lishens even if just to resell in the UK to the highest bidder
ooh sick
whats highest
yeah that was it
id buy 10
so the battery is only 20yuan??
idk why but when i refreshed it worked
everything here shows up as 10 yuan
hmm
hm
do you have a link to the ns14 listing
you could cling film wrap the lishens and ship it in there
that sbt90 light doesnt ship with batteries does it
oops
could you wait until tmrw to maker the order- im thinking that sbt90 light or something else plus two lishens
flat iirc
already got a ns59
tempting
50 üò≥
614m of throw
peircing the darkness has a nice video of it
i might also snag one of those
sbt-90 for 25 gbp
how much do the jkk90 and ns14 cost
lemme ask around
UK or USA whichever is easiest for you
could you wait til later tonight
i need a couple bits
PERFECT TIMING
a couple sparks and some smoke
should i bring some magnets to act as spacers for the p45b
if the ns59 accepts button top 21700
yeah a couple threads ive seen vary between "its minorly better" to "its a significant downgrade"
i did that once- thankfully with just a crappy 14500
No need to gues
ü§¶
I'll just measure my batteries and compare to the listing
Just occured to me
Hmm
I think I'd compromise on charging current if I could get a 4 bay longer charger with IR
You guys are a blessing fr
Thank you üëç
Does the 8 allow 8 to be charged at once
Ty
Cool
I need something with higher charging current and a internal resistance readout and slightly larger than a VC4
I'll get a vc4l - I think it's larger
With a little brass nub welded on
The ones in the ns59 have 5-8mm more roughly on the end
Which is what gives me pause
But- it didn't fit the ns59 lishen
Nah the original lishen 60A or so
Do p45b fit in the vc4?
Just ordered p45b
Anyone know how many lumens I lose going p45b instead of the lishen in a ns59
Ty ty
<@754842238676238406> you the goat
What us store sells 21700
Does the vc4l have internal resistance
I use a xtar something (no IR)
Also do you know if the vc4 fits the lishen customs for the ns59
Yeah I gotcha, how do I know the new cells are matched?
I told do one wire at a time
He just yanked the battery and they stuck together
I charge with magnets because the batteries won't fit in the charger
Nope
Thankfully my dad's happy to pay if it means getting a replacement
Fine so I've got one good battery - maybe neal will send me if I beg
What's the replacement, p45b?
Yeah that's what I figured
A couple seconds and the wire started smoking
How bad is it shorting one
My dad shorted one of the special batteries for the nightwatch ns59
1 day before I leave for america
Fuuuuuuck
not just a plano convex
ohh are they properly tuned stuff
although these use a biconvex lens iirc and not a plano-convex
i imagine dedoming LEPs may have some benfits
you can see this initial lense/dome in this thor 1 teardown
so part of what im asking is- how bad would it be to open up my LEP; has someone got a opened up lep that theyve poked around in
and removing the precollimator i dont have any specific numbers
the wavien is apparently meant to get 2x improvements at most
because the thor 3 would be a pretty great host
and possibly adding a wavien
so im thinking, is there much to gain by removing it
the thor LEP series use a precollimator
i heard using a precollimator before a lens will increase lumens but decrease throw/intensity
culpm next iirc
yeah cslnm is smallet
today is not my day
oh no
so how come the LEP in the bottom right has higher candela but less range than a "lance of ra"
now thats a light i havent seen yet!
althout it couldve been the reflex- the reflex is very pricy tho
i thought it was his pipe-bomb esque tube light with aspheric
i never checked which of his lights threw best
hehehehehe- yup im hours of reading into some funny german forum and most of anything related to enderman
2 steps ahead of you üòÜ
yeah i couldnt justify it either- so much less for the same cost as a thor 3
1km or 50m throw
but the versatility ü§î
i reckon a small friction fit 3d printed diffuser would make it a perfect edc
ive been thirsting over a thor 1 for a while now
ü§ú
you?
i got mine 98 without tax üòé
ive been scrolling endermans BLF all day
started me down this path
thor 3
maybe 3km or so
theres a church spire juuust out of reach of my LEP
i wanna point it at the horizon and just light it
going for that 5km beacon
nah nah i dont want any spill
no problem if im using a huge dish sized reflector- i can get a big li-ion pack going
oh bloody hell- just occured to me it wouldnt- spill dosnt come off the reflector ü§¶
do reflex have spill?
and sell it off when im happy with it
but ill probably make a crazy searchlight
for any project
in which case ill be LEP all the way
im working on getting a 600 quid grant
so size is no problem- price may be
Some xpl hi and xpg
Some LEP mentions but not in the real mega throwers
A couple mentions of a double stack LED
I see a lot of chatter about the osram flat black but that's from 2018 ish
What's the current best lm/mm^2 emmiter
I see
Aha
OH
A mule won't have a hotspot?
For now I'll go cheap and get 20cm
Fresnel
30cm
Or 12cm?
Ah so 20cm works
For me- where my diverging light will become parallel
For the intended use, where parallel light from the sun converges to a point
I would've thought further away
So a closer focal distance is best?
when taking a LED and shining it through a fresnel lense, do i want one with a high or low focal length- id think low so it can be more compact but i dont know if that'll give a more divergent beam?
Damn you're good, it is I'm not sure what temperature though
A bit ringy at the center
I'm gonna take it out to my usual range test spots tonight, I'll let you know how it compares to a l21b culpm
I just ripped it apart, got 3 18650, one reflector, one knock-off xhp70.2
And it never turned on
It was a foot long plastic beast
Some cheapo AliExpress light
it was 13 quid
some cheapo aliexpress torch
A 3d printed nut to secure it and it'd be okay
That's actually alright
I'm not even mad
Smort
Im an avid lover of Klipper but marlin is good enough if you don't want web function and easier firmware changes
Send me any questions if you need help
But the wiring is pretty simple
It's not a direct replacement
I think
It does use whatever bin is there
The quiet board isn't proper stealthchop and still makes a lot of noisd
And a skr1.4 with 2209
A good foam block and a concrete slab will help
Ahh, I just wouldn't get the quiet board
Quieter and faster
Get klipper going and BAM
And a pi zero w
Some 2209
Nah nah. Get yourself a proper upgrade- skr 1.4 or most mellow boards are fine
Or just soon
Any ETA for those?
im thinking ts10- red body and green aux (if in stock)
s21e- orange body and sft40 (maybe 519a but im not too bothered either way probably sft40 for he runtime)
but can someone wih both lend me a hand
i know theyre almost completely different
aliexpress.com/item/1005004584642426.html
wurkkos.com/products/ts10?VariantsId=10733
3gbp difference
but
im happy with my sc31 pro in terms of size and pocketability
new edc time
id have thought the left but from what youve said im thinking right
rosy w1 on the right??
Balls
So that with a larger aspheric? To get a nice beam
Puts light to a single point
Double convex?
So would a small zoomie lens behind a large Fresnel be better than just a fresnel
a white 3d printed cone under the lens would probably be good enough
would benefit from a reflective cone to capture some of the flood
and its alright
i got the phones fresnel into focus
just poked around with a old aspheric
ahhh
whered you get 1k from
mine is around 50-100 lumens
would those produce the same LEP-like beam
a proper lens thoo
i tried with a l21b reflector, it was alright but the phone just doesnt ouput much light
ive been meaning to build a blue LED mega thrower with my fresnel for a while
iirc for the way we use it, the lense cant focus smaller that the original source, so a LEP of equivalent lumens to a LED will be ighter after focusing (feel freee to corrct me)
theres a few mega throwers running off LEDs and fresnl lenses, theyre just larger
but yeah i hear you on getting the right focus
sorry, meant the camera lens would be a focus to infinity one
i know diddly squat about optics, but id imagine you want a lens that focuses to infinity to get that long thin beam. in terms of wavien collar a cheap mirror hemisphere would work good enough for a cheapo
fair enough
would you get a wavien collar in there, the thor 3 seems to have one teeny half dome lens and then a convex??? at the front
i see, so to remove their crappy lens
to get the raw output or to get the blue laser?
ah that, true. even my thor 3 has that tho
not sure tbh, but i assume its the lens that makes a good beam
cheapest ive sen it in almost 6 months
¬£30 for a LEP module
naturally weaker or thinner spot possibly?
even in vr im a flashlight enthusiast
*please*
Point them to *me*
Free torches, and input on new designs
Marry into the sofirn family
Marry them
Now I'm no pro but I'm not seeing any clear design choices pointing to dual channel
also unsure about the ts10 options
im on the fence about the if the z1 is worth it, might just get a s2+ with blue instead of in the z1 although no throwy option there
theres my order
true, so id get 4000k for the nicer nuetral tone
im thinking the higher colour for moar lumens
what colour temp tho
imma stick with stock
nahhh
is that an option??
6000k or 4000k for the ts10?
When everyone but me was asleep üò°üò°
Over night
We had a big one a month ago
Actually might try that later
Light dry brush probably wouldn't hurt performance, some silver on a black torch to emulate wear would be sick
I'll be trying it again later today so I'll let you know if I get any significant improvement
I think drain cleaner is best since it won't foam like the oven cleaner I have does
Somewhere room temp and make sure to check on it over now and then to clear any schmoo and replace the cleaner if it's looking funky
Any drain cleaner or oven cleaner with sodium hydroxide
I'd just worry it wouldnt be as durable
Yeah de anodising and re anodising would be sick
but the side surface is üë®‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë®
and the top surface had a lump i sanded off
the inside looks funky
one sec
it scratches easily but i like the look of the de-ano un-sanded aluminium
i reckon if i keep it floating in the cleaner and keep it indoors and check every 30m and just give it a clean every 1hr i could get a good removal
the anodiztion is off but theres some funny residue and a weird blotch/mark on the bottom]
left it overnight and cleaned and left for another hour
the de ano finally worked
ask about hank from emisar
someone hop in
yeah not bad
hm
What is your recommend EDC (every day carry) flashlight/ torch?
whats your reply?
<@754842238676238406>
<@927008889092857898>  what is the "best" flashlight/ torch?
1: RED OR 2: SILVER TS10?
Awesome, I'll read through those all after work, my only other question for now is wether you've tried heat tinting the BOSS knock-off, the only reason I'd get titanium is for a stonewash finish or to heat tint it
true, i can always get the firefly in another colour, not the T3 tho
aliexpress.com/item/1005004712589160.html  green body/aux + 4000K 
aliexpress.com/item/1005005077551729.html  deep red body + 2700K 
aliexpress.com/item/1005004646577871.html  stonewash + 2700K

help me choose between these 3 for a first EDC- ive bought plenty large lights before so id like to branch out into the small pocket size category
this will be my first ever EDC torch
<@450949207726096385> was reading your review of that BOSS and CITAEL knockoffs. you seem pretty well versed in TI lights, whats the cheapest one youve got?
Nothing cheaper
Hm so the two lights you said are around 35
I've never heard that being a issue on ti lights, are yours all scratched
Find any small stainless steel chunk and hold it over a gas hob or hot flame and see the colour change
Just not as vivid
It also works on stainless steel
Probably, I'd try on the smallest peice you have first though
And it's changes colours
Stick it over a hot flame
That's alright, I'll hand polish or sand. Imma heat tint it too anyways
I'll see if I can get those second hand or just pony up full price
The rider Rx is pretty cool
Ooah alright
Just EDC size and ti
Any performance
Any battery
What's the cheapest ti light I can get
yeah LEP  wavien and a huuuge lens would be so sick
i been eyeballing these bad boys
ye 
or a proper host and LEP
ooh nice, similar to the cardboard box 4mcd thrower
i think the negative terminal connects through the body yes
yeah scrub both ends and make sure any copper parts on the pcb are clean
that part needs a strong electrical contact
of the threads id assume
oooh whats it for
kinda want one
ive been reading about wavien collar
oh cool
tldr: question is whether i can put a lighted pcb into the convoy z1 and keep the metal switch
i dont want to waste his time
yeah same, is it worth contacting simon for?
are the pcbs between metal switch and silicone switch identical
and the red is for the s2+
and put the rgb in a thrower ive got
ive got a spare blue lit pcb ill put in the z1
final order
cool
idk if theres any difference just wondered if ones inherently worse
also far red?
and what about blue
sst10 or 20?
i dont have any rosy lights anyways
ill just spend the money then
oh i see
the dichroic glass is much cheaper than me buying a whole new light
which would be best for getting coloured light
bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1453217-REG/nisha_cr58_58mm_color_red_filter.html
bhphotovideo.com/c/product/54541-REG/Tiffen_4980B_49mm_80B_Color_Conversion.html

VS

lumenalights.com/shop/product/dichroic-glass-lens/
ah cool, out of my price range. maybe someday
how much do those cost?
If anything I've wanted to cut down anduril to get to the modes I like easier, what changes would you make?
Or theonedeals
It's something like theonetd
Sorry I don't have the exact code
managed to snag a ns59v2 for 86gbp
theres others if you google for it
the christmas one was good
it only adjusts voltage not current
direct would kill the LED
i have a lab bench psu, it doesnt need to be portable
preferably adjustable but doesnt have to be
whats the absolute cheapest way to get a UV led to power on
Uh oh
im leaning towards the zoomie because i can play in flood and in a lightsbaer mode
which is gonna be more lightsaber-y
both are same LED
size is no issue
if i couldnt hold it in my fingers its safe
cool
AH, so it doesnt *really * matter
how? my house is kinda dusty?
i dont care about the throw losses but i dont want any damage
it wont damage the emitters or catcgh fire?
i'd end up wth a bit of dust under the lens in my n259v2
is it worth it?
thinking of heat anodizing my staibnless bezel
i managed to win one, finally get to try some blue and red emitters
i didnt like the search game since a lot of people dont know how to catch uop from stream delay
he also did a number guessing game twice
tho i think the s21d is meant to have a side switch version that im waiting on
i loved my s21d, or the q8 or sp36
oh definitely, if you wait 3 or so hours i can nab a beamshot of my backyard
and throw
honestly, i didnt check. but probably yeah
the led itself is very tough
took a knife, sliced off the dome and got scraping
a really funky blue
yeah the phosphor is all scraped off mine
reckon its powering itself?
it glows differently when shorted vs when in open circuit
shining uv on it
huh
its a quad die LED
now i just wanna see what it does next
just for fun, got it from some 1000000lm AliX special, dedomed and removed the phosphor for some cool lighting
ive got a mystery LED that runs fine on 9v and 3v
yeah i was thinking of two 9v batteries for 18v
would low current but too high voltage be bad for a LED
not me if i keep spending all my money
eatings even betta
my friends broken light will do nicely
otherwise imma just try find a used light and bim bam boom dedome
convoy got anything?
brev $40
ah i meant a proper proper deep blue
Buy a second hand white light and remove the phosphor or buy a blue light
What'd be the cheapest way to get a blue light
share them beamshots
lucky
i might send it to a family member
its such a good work light
im on the edge still
money
but
i also wanna buy a opple
i cant choose
and its SO warm
yeh sorry, took a sec
and you get the spare driver and LED for xhp70.2
its so cheeep
they sell a 14 gbp gtfc40 full swap kit
tell me if you order <@754842238676238406>
oooo
good or bad?
üò©
im looking at beamshots
im out
yeh, do i still have to use the tailswitch
all else i want is that m21e with sideswitch
my life will be compelte
itll be my first side switch thrower
cause i may just do it
is this good enough
ooooooooooooo
id have to buy
light is forever
hunger is temporary
i cant afford
please
NOOOOOOO
and its xhp70
its side switch
lord give me strength
1000lm i thik i saw in another listing
xml2 iirc
but itll have to wait for the weekend
i can print a teeny one for my sc31 pro and let you know how it looks
surely thats just a white tpu cap ?
this is perfect
eh for family that rarely use and just want something to huck in a drawer
just a fine gift torch
cheap
absolute gobs of features
ramping, strobes, moonlight, blinkers
its got a lot of modes
a flashlight UI
wuben x1
And a Thor 3
Ns59v2 xhp50.2 üòéüòé
im 50/50 on those, occasionally its justified because they prioritize that over food or other stuff. and occasionally its just a buzzkill SO
they all know the struggle
late night dog walkers are where its at
but when you get a phone call from a friend saying they see your beacon thats when you know youve made it, ive heard people sigh in relief after walking around a corner to see its a child playing with torches and not first contact with aliens
its all in good fun, so no hurt feelings
a couple of my friends houses back onto the park i use for beamshots, theyve occasionally rang me up to tell me the can see me walking around
mine are sick of my torches, i get a lot of "kys" after sharing beamshots
wooooaaaaah
and now
i got my first multi emitter light (30k lumens) and wasnt wholly impressed tbh. went out bought the best torch from my local hardware store
3d printers use silicone on the hotend and those safely go to 280c
unless it smoking then nope
also short carbon arc lamp
u got a printer?
i think i recognise you, are you in vzbot or annex engineering
does that sound right
i think maxa blaster?
Just posted on blf
No it was a custom one
Ultra max blaster or something
It's was a blf special
What's the name of the mega thrower
They got a large aspheric lens in front
Take a peek at most new cars
LEP are already used in car headlights
ive had more luck with 3D printing competitions tho so im not too salty
same
nearly missed this
boys
Now to wait for hermes
Wayyy my torch cleared customs
cause im getting a nightwatch ns59vs
me rn
and we ship a LOT of stuff
we're good friends with the mail man, lovely guy
no delivery
but for pick ups
royal mails been to my house 4 times in the past week
right?????
im sure itll be here any second now
the small beat up convoy box
i see my box
ooh ooh

i can see my box!!!

the royal mail worker standing next to my parcel rn
it might only arrive post chrismus
the royal mai; strikes are killing me
it still hasnt moved üíÄ
pokelite?
a s2+ UV, whats youra?
16 quid torch aint worth it
2 hours way
its at heathrow
worst part is
simon on alix
who from?
day 8 üíÄ
and the dyed ones for adding colour
can probably use the non blownout plastic bottles for coating
new way to make diffusers?
guhh
for my grandma to read with
usb rechargeable or single use batteries
looking for 600 ish lumens
price doesnt matter
hey anyone know of a flashlight with one click on , no modes
<@166235904933888000> at that price. I'd think silver/grey anodisation or untreated alum
Thats a absolute steal
With battery
Final cost 19 quid
Ôø°17.04  33%OFF | New TS10 Powerful Mini 1400LM EDC Flashlight 14500 with 3* 90 CRI LEDs and Single Color Aux Anduril 2 Pocket  Waterproof  Torch

might try this with some spares
is it really worth the extra ¬£17
i dont like charging, but idm loosing out on runtime for output. so im mostly split between the two s2
since runtime is so small
also, is the t2 worth getting for it size. or is there not much point
aliexpress.com/item/32873025585.html
aliexpress.com/item/32955740360.html
aliexpress.com/item/1005002652344256.html
which of these will flouresce most
cheers
yeah thats what i was thinking of
is uva the right type?
getting my first UV torch
is iron a euphemism for flashlight or are we talking about different products
is a ts10 worth 19 quid?
I don't even know how it got opened
Must've sat for a couple weeks like that
It's full of dust
Fml
Bezel on my l21b managed to unscrew itself
its the thor3, i noticed theres either some spill around the beam or light bouncing off air which lights stuff up before the actual hotspot touches it
Dayum
This LEP has got FLOOD for daaayyyss
ah true
possibly cheaper prices with cree? or priority with cree to get LEDs for a price?
Oh yeah I mean the two name were just talking about battery size. I thought maybe the 2665 battery was randomly super cheap
Dang, explains the price tho
for 25?
is that a legit sf2
kek
Shouldn't get overpowered rither
But it might work
I'll have to see how big the lens is on the thor
This looks promising
<@754842238676238406> 
Googling it and it seems DIY dichroic glass might be possible, I'll look more but I might be able to batch produce it and sell off the rest to other people looking for a filter
And does it diffuse the beam much
I was hoping for a DIY solution so I could fit it to every light I have. Can I ask though, is the filter solid or is a thin plastic film
maybe ill buy some tinted glass
hm
i just worry about how much itll be diffused
a 400 lumen lep?
if it works for stage lighting
i think the gel sheet would be good no?
Gel Color Filter Sheet
i tried cellophane i think, but it melted
wont that diffuse it quite a bit?
or ways to DIY
are there any colour filters for the thro 3 LEP
yeh i find high pitches dont get blocked. but cars, airplanes and alike noises get cancelled easily
also if you ever find one bud getting wuieter than the other, try use some hydrogen peroxide on the tip to melt the earwax inside
no problem, i really love the buds series. found a free pair of buds plus that needed some cleaning. comfort is wonderful (sound is meh)
gotta hit a button to see through them
uvc
Is this dang thing on
Shines into eyes
People don't understand anduril and cock up my lights
Yuppp
I find license plates still get illuminated at those ANSI rated distances but that'd be it really
<@558976020317732874> bring it tmrw, ill try fix it
ooh so i can unscrew the pill/pcb and just resolder large joint, check if it work and if it doesnt might need a couple minutes in a oven to reflow it
yeah, im thinking it was dropped, cracked pcb or something that requires the pcb being taken out for better inspection
it does trubo tho when tightened very hard or jigglerd in just the right way
maybe clean it?
personally, i think somethings not making contact
Yeah
rude
oi
like when you press it eventually makes contact asnd registers it
kinda sounds like bad contact
its a sideswitch right?
i have the buds 2 which i love, the buds 2 pro came out so picking up a used pair of buds2 should be easy
my pair have never fallen out my ear and last me the entire working day
i love my buds two, if you want to buy a pair id look at ebay or equivalent when buds 2 pro launch to pick up a pair
gah damn
darn
She doesn't look good
could make a very rough inner surface with crazy high area
then less heat to the hand and better looking specs
use some titanium heat press rings as standoffs for a second outer shell
manufactureres will get around the issue asily tho
just makes my hands clammy
53 is comfortable imo
True
But possible
It seems unlikely heat made it all the way through the tube and 2 thread
Or a funny contact back there?
What if the switch has a lot of resistance, the tail cap would heat up
got the phone box to prop up the mega psu
subtle flex
We professionals have standards after all
Hey I only eat mud on a Tuesday tyvm
i saw some come with yellow filters, what arer those for?
got the thor3
and it was so much cheaper than i thought itd be
now its on the slowboat from china
just got my first LEP
ahhhh im so excited
claim it, i think thats what i got, its like 3 per every 12 spent
really?, did you calim the discount?
whats a good 21700 to go with this light?
84 total without battery
with the sale rn
less than 90 quid
thor 3
holy shit
The fan could certainly share a ground
Or am I getting it mixed up
Wouldn't each button need its own ground?
I thought checking it would be the best no?
Shoosh
I carry my s21d everywhere. It's good for indoor and outdoor and the high cri is lovely. It's not super practical but I like it's stubby build and I stuck a metal button on it
I'll get some more photos when I get to Connecticut, there's a nice lake where I can get some shots
Back in England I gotta get a tripod and use a longer exposure
No messing with iso or exposure
I just point the light and take a normal photo
It's so humid here, getting beamshots requires 0 effort
<@712776310753329162> ^
And thoroughly confused them explaining colour temp CRI and beam quality
Plus showed all the lights off to family
What a gleeful giggle
And a hotel worker saw me and wanted to take the light on a little spin
Went outside for a beamshot
I got my redemption
Alright
Ever other day of this holiday I'd carried a high cri flooder, thrower and a throwier edc
Everyone asked where my torches were
The one time I leave all my lights at the hotel and don't take them with to dinner someone complains it's gotten too dark to walk back
And colour is much less distinguished
Much less red irl
Looks to the eye like 2700k
Monochromatic lights at my hotel
I thought it was a desk fan at first glance
They was a airplane mounted one in ww2 iirc
Those are sick
Yeah that's what I was thinking of
Carbon arc I think they're called
What about a carbon light
i could get the thor + lens mabe for similar pice
but
since ive essentially got 100 spare to do whatever with it makes the mateminco much more ''affordable'' just 38 or so quid outta pocket
Both are roughly the same cost
Should I buy a thor3, or c8 blue + s2 UV+ prescription lenses for VR
is that a aliexpress 50A tho?
just cause CF
yeah, better than PLA, i was gonna point you towards something like this 
nvm then
eu?
id like some cf/gf ASA would look slick
why not ASA
oh phew
huh, that seems significantly low
fair enough, bUt HoWs ThE cRi I oNlY lIkE rOsY hIgH cRi ThRoWeRs
do you have any candella measurements for it?
sOlId FlOoDy LiGhT, dO yOu EdC iT
could DIY it
ah right, gotta be mcpcb
could you just stick a box with that shape cut into it
for waterproofing you buy a tupperware or metal box with ipx7 rating then cut holes and stick a sheet of glass on
then get a printed jig that presses some tir lenses on
go on jlpcb, order pcb that has 4 3v LEDs in series and however more in parralel to get them lumens
if youve got a 12v supply
wouldnt be too hard
what is it?
moderator? <@754842238676238406>
so
right
we can settle for a non custom role
Cool, do you know if there's any coming up soon
Like the blf discount for convoy
Do they have any *secret* discounts
I'll save the cash then and use them
Oh cool
which do i buy from
117 vs 128
aliexpress.com/item/1005004229110091.html?mp=1  theres a store selling the thor3 for less than the official store (¬£10 less)
aliexpress.com/item/1005003493281967.html
ill bargain for a joint
i am offering a trade
you are annoyig
me--->üòé   
you--->ü§°
<@680894452742619163> ill make a trade, custom role here for me, custom role for you in vzbot 
be quiet, theres plenty roles to go round
can i have the ''ow my eyes'' role
Ah fine. Replace them and see if the switch is broken
Do you have a charger or multimeter?
but antman exists
its only pros are the size
yeah, theres just not much in terms of lense in that torch
yeah
where'd you hear about it
2.5x throw for 45 less
only 1000m?
which ine?
the thor 3 is 105. i dont think itll get cheaper than that for the same distance
nvm
so
but i forgot about all the mirrors and lesnes
depending on the cost of the rest it might be cheaper
saw a module for 99
or would i need a custom machined one
do any hosts exist
looks like a diy lep isnt too expensive
profit??
fly it around
tie cow figurine to the bottom
stick a lep to the bottom of a ufo shaped drone
I NEED A DRONE, LEP AND UFO DECAL
my friend had every card in the deck by the end
yup
gaming
As if there's a difference
I think they mean. I don't want to see kr1 beams I want to see these d1 beamshots
Which model? All the thors I saw were more expensive with less range I think
it seems like a really good torch at almost 2km
wouldnt it be the best throw/dollar LEP
if so
Do they generally show up really low. Or are there good CRI green emitters
Also how do you pronounce CRI, do you say 'cry' or "c.r.i"
How would a green light show up for CRI
''flashaholics favourite song''
no clue what the answer is
im stuck
My first month back at school I get ~2-3 days of school as the rest of the days happen to be Jewish festivals
I go to a special Jewish school so we skip some holidays and have different timings
I think
Every 5 or so weeks we have 5 days off and every 10 weeks we get 2 weeks off. Then a 6 week summer
are you from america?
Permission granted
Everyone got sent home early
Hit 41c indoors at my school today
you can stack convoy lights üòÉ
ah alright
whats this mean ion the 1lumen giveaways
i go to school with them
ah cool
on av1
hey <@321486891079696385> do you know a lbsiuk#6969
I found a video guide to much better than verbal or vidual map
Which is why this one thew me
My first and only anduril light (sc31 pro) came in advanced
Thank you
It worked
10h is click 9 times and hold on the tenth click right?
<@298216330564337665>
How do I tell
I'm not sure
AFAIK they're both the same ui
I can do it first try on my sc31 prp but not the if25a
Hey I just got a if25a and I'm having issues getting to the strobes
219B ü§î
If I get more üí∏ I'll build one
A long flexible umbilical cord supplies water and power to a 12v array of LEDS to get 15000 lumen with good cooling
One backpack with a reservior, pump and a huge battery. Then you run it through the cheapest pc water-cooling parts available
How do you feel about wearing 15kg of batteries and Waterloop equipment
It's doable
Well
Or you put clear wrap on all you batteries for a certain torch. And a red wrap for another torch. Then you never mix and match cells. They'll always be balanced
I don't mind the head not fully closing. But is the focus all good, should the beam look like that
also if the front glass holder doesnt fit down all the way should i remove the oring or the glass first to get it fully screwed on
and should it ''focus'' to a point just infront of the light
should it be particularly throwy, its floodier than my smooth reflector
should i see a faint image of the LED
5-15 degree clear smooth top TIR lens
what should i be seeing
i just got some for my sc31 pro
hey could someone help me out with TIR lenses
do i message him about a refund or having the right things shipped over. or just suck it up
the images are the wrong way round. image 2 happened first
i bought a pack of TIR's from convoy but the wrong items showed up
i feel bad becuase i clearly didnt do the buyers note correctly and the order was pretty complex for $3 but he did also say hed note it.
The UK gets 2 week shipping and customs doesn't really slow down the package so I wouldn't buy from a reseller personally
If it's gonna be a lot faster or avoid dodgy customs then I don't see why not
ipad 2 ftw
Hey anyone know of some gu10 bulbs with good cri and (because my dad insists) 500+ lumen
Ah, lots of reading
How do you find these deals?
i dont know if he would reduce price properly and im worried ill end up with 15 TIR  lenses
yeah but then ill end up paying 3x no? <@389869960664449036>
he said put it in the buyer notes, but i dont know if i can mix and match between listings
how do i explain to simon this order:
aliexpress.com/item/1005001973359493.html  1x30¬∞

Lmao, I was just outside messing around with a flashlight and someone joined in with a green laser
Honestly, no clue. My theory is that either he's using a AI chatbot and occasionally takes over or he's just really fuckin rich
Tac griz is great. I'm surprised he isn't just a chatbot. He responds to everypost I've made and helped
Quick question, could you add a lens that focuses to infinity Infront of a LEP
I found that out the hard way. A license plate or similar hi vis item lights up at close to the ansi range
We're just very friendly
Lmao
at least its a friendly community
L
18 welcomes
I keep my l21b on my cap, ez. All you need is a counterweight and a chinstrap
Fair enough, I just opened the website and the first flashlight that came up is the one I said I liked the most
Free is free, and a non hobbyist only cares that it's B R I G H T
for much more detailed info
its has moved, aliexpres just doesnt show the full pictur in tracking, enter the tracking number here 
No ug glass or lights
No luck at the thrifts this holiday in America
Dang
I think so, it's not a threaded bulb, the plastic fixture has threads that push it into a contact
I assume this isn't that?
Worth buying to mod?
Any fun bulb I could stuff in here?
Maybe worth buying a 395 light and visiting a glass factory
This looks so cool
Anyone else urbex
<@558837879023861761> you do urbex right?
Some of the American presenters in a "show and tell" seemed pretty dimwitted comparatively but this competition is for people interested in coding/making and requires you to make something to enter so I hoped it wouldn't attract numpties
Bro whatttt üò≠üò≠
One category to vote on is most technical üò≠
And to submit you need to he on the slack and a student ID
Yup
So unless there's a exploit it should be fine
Entering requires a valid ID and for you to enter a project
BUT
Me rn
There's a ASL computer vision translator (easily copied) and a 65% keyboard (tonnes of guides online)
There's a unbuilt gokart, it's only got one render and a single sentence
But
Man I need that, I voted again on this round, and there's some really impressive things
2nd and 3rd are bambu lab A1 and AMS
The tickets to the convention cost like 1k üò≠
The prize is a round trip to San Fran and tickets to the GitHub convention
It was a really hard kick in the balls for suee
I also lost to a photo of a metal box with the text "WIP - update readme and remove placeholder photo"
Ah well
So it seems unfair that a good project that could win, loses in a early bracket due to not being funny
When it comes to the final 4 tho I assume none of the crap will win
Some really cool projects didn't make it to this round
Yup üòê
I made it to the second bracket, the soundboard made it to the third
I'm gonna off myself
<@1246544192058953758> my searchlight lost in a competition to a skibidi soundboard
It's the bestest
3000K sft40 in my EDC ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
Yo <@140540414154375168> just noticed you starred my searchlight GitHub, thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I'll pack it into a backpack with a inverter and batt
Yipeee
Reckon id actually win?
I AM SO ENTERING
Also what happens if you win
What kind of detail should I include
Ahh okay
There's not a lot of technical stuff going on
Is it still running?
It's written for a average audience so there's some bits that I would change or exclude for yall
Check out this writeup I made on my searchlight
I just need to insert some captioned photos
Hey <@346077022155440140> I gave it a rejig, what do you think
1. Fix grammar 
2. Change informal writing to be less cringe
3. Lay off the jargon maybe
Maybe people will think it's impressive and vote for it?
I'm not sure how to further reduce that
We're on the same page there
Oh yeah yup
There's one paragraph about the electronics that is pretty dense with the terms like NTC current limiter
I'm hoping that the younger audience will find it entertaining tho
Agreed
Ah dang I forgot to fix them, otherwise the content is okay? This is my second draft, I need to reorder it too
So I'm tryna talk about the searchlight without being too boring
It's peer judged so everyone who enters gets to judge, everyone will be between 12 and 18
It's for a competition, the best project submitted wins a round trip to the GitHub convention
Rate the quality of my writing
Got that wood roof going on tho
What book is that <@657991318219390979>
The bulb looks elliptical but has some lens on it, I'm worried about removing it and exposing myself to UVC
Gonna set it up tonight
I think this should be pretty easy
Second projector arrived
[thinksmart](
buy an opple to more accurate
fair
or rather this
hey <@1246544192058953758>  reckon this would work
Maybe I design a inverter and use my 100 dollar coupon from jlcpcb
What's the easiest way/cheapest way
<@1246544192058953758> how do I make this thing portable, my ups doesn't seem to want to work as a portable bank even tho the battery is new
I was always anti lightbox
I mean I guess but it just sounded like a advert, that's what I was skeptical about
Nah, not common at all really
it looks like the LED is exposed? and theres not much of an optic, which is fine as a mule but im not a fan personally
or its special
for that drain maybe its not li-ion?
100ma is roooughhh
souns very shill-y
what about a user show off section

need this as a flair on the reddit
IVE PEAKED
true - most of my UHP info comes from luna and is spread over ~ 1 year
fair enough, if i get another parabolic ill just make it a dual head thrower like the owleyes
<@657991318219390979> what do you think, similar to <#1195023268265087106>  but "üõ†Ô∏è Ô∏±user-projects "
i suppose theres a few long standing projects im inerested in that id read
probably - but would anyone actively read threads?
DT01141
this looks elliptical to me
the P in the name?
POA-LMP122
this is probably parabolic right?
its from aliexpress and i couldnt get it to fire up

[tech_wow](
9.2Mcd
cool, how do i convert my range measurement into candela
sweet, so definitely my longest range light but not quite the 30km i was hoping for. how do i get that in candela?
112090 lux at 9.1m (baseline 2796 lux outdoors)
how do i get throw from these measurements?
ah youre  right i used the wrong logic
resstor in parralel to the thermistor?
Sp33s?
i hate the feeling of stickers so i just have a polycarb panel that ive stickerbombed
valid
i thought the trans fist was part of the tklamp logo for a sec ü§£
x75 with a really big ziptie
they must be able to susatin okay?
what about the m21g or m21...
yessir
any multi cell options
my bad it wasnt a 1lumen review youre right
different to the v3 somehow
sp33s
yah 1lumen review shows it shockingly
because reasons
but i cant reccomend it
sp33s does it single cell?
yupp
and is the stuff that needs doing just compiling stuff and defining pins?
why isnt it t1616?
ah okay yeah ik sitrels busy - not much i can do about it either. do you know the specifics?
and maybe some to sell or giveaway
but consider - free drivers for you and me and sitrel at least
yeah not anymore
what can sustain 1.5k lumens for 2hrs. any form factor but 26xxx. beam quality doesnt matter, slightly floody definitely not a thrower
i have a trick thatll mean i can get them for free plus some to giveaway (if its okay with you)
true but its a lot more expensive
close enough that id be ableto fumble my way through finishing it?
how close is it
anything else?
not really. you can move the pil in the s6 and get long springs but it wont throw the same. itll be like a s2+
ANSI FL1 is a standard spec. like comparing IP ratings.
the spec is distance at which the light will be ~0.25 lux (eqv to light coming from the moon) 
so saying its 700m according to ansi fl1 means it will likely be bright enough to be useable with the naked eye at somewhere bewteen 3/4 and 1/2 of the spec
but it depends how good your eyesight is
so personally a useable distance would be around half of that  at around 350m
which is 0.25 lux at ~700m
thats likely according to the ansi fl1 standard
<@544931397048205312>  üëâ üëà  hows the driver going
when im back from the shops ill give it a go
light
and voila
do i just short a optocoppler and plug in my power and power on the fan
cool
its 470uf
<@1246544192058953758> im thinking of powering on the new bulb, its 250W though and i dont know if the psu i built will hold up
irl it wont look white, itll just be painfully bright in some situations
same thing

What's the DUV on that fella, might want some lee minus to clean it up
capacity would be sucky
i could try 3 alkaline in series and DD - gotta look for a holder
so i dont want to overdischarge
its gonna be on for ages with no way to monitor voltage - my parents will keep it
i have a suitably crappy driver for my crappy LED but no way to safely supply 3v for extended periods (this will be in a small lamp)
i dont know how to power the LED tho

xpg4 might be fun
xpg4 triple vs 519a
would a triple cree even out the rainbow/shifting or is it better to just get a 519a triple
Nah, I got it in a giveaway so slim chances, plus I reflowed a new LED üòÇ
Reckon desoldering the battery and resoldering it would help by rebooting the whole thing?
Not that I can see, the problem was pretty spontaneous as far as I can tell
stainless steel?
<@632481278368677888> i saw your teardown, do you have much other experience with troubleshooting it?
Nope battery is a healthy 4v
Chances the battery is dead or something else?
It won't charge, turn on or respond to any button presses
Working on a dead wuben x3
Anodisation is pretty weak but otherwise good ligut
Dual fuel
Efficient driver
The l2s is pretty legit
Why fet over linear with the super low mode
If not I'll buy the proper board and some w2 or smth
Cool, reckon linear is enough for 8 sst20
For the knock-off d4s
I need it to power 8 sst20
And can I flash the super low moon on one
How much does a d4s driver from Hank cost
Slowly but surely I'm getting there üò≠
How would you calculate that?
Ah okay but if you don't mind a non perfect design, larger is better than too small
Does hole size actually matter?
Cheap d4s style light has a cool driver tho
Had too much to drink for this
I'll deal with it tomorrow
Ah dang okay
pull inward?
what do i do with them?
just checked, its a std reflector
How do I disassemble this
Probably as ugly
Maybe throwier
The only efficient option I have is sst20
And if it's efficient then maybe I'll leave it
Yeah it's nice for sure
Not sure yet tho
Gonna replace with sst20, lh351d or xpg4
P9?
Domeless something
No clue what the l2s led is
Can't wait for the kr cslnm l21b
The d4s knock-off is a really nice size and material so it's probably worth getting a nice driver for it
The l2s has some interesting features and I'll definitely swap the LED
I'm thinking of putting a sst20 Dr in and putting a ws5050 into a proper convoy c8+
Advertise as c8 but I gotta take some measurements
I'll put one in my l21b to replace a CULPM
what a battery can safely deliver for extended periods
continuous discharge rate
thats how i did it, drowned it in solder and wiped off the excess
My first reflow was done with a soldering iron,  two qtips and a tile on my lap, for large components like LEDs it's pretty straightforward
If you don't care about the current emmiter on there, try remove it and practice putting it back on
For practice
I'd just remove the mitter and reflow it back on
Do you have spare/crappy light
Salty is kinda right, it's direct drive so it's kinda hard to know, it depends on things like vf which I don't understand enough to advise you on
If you're swapping the whole board just check you won't need a new centering gasket and optic
And if you're reflowing, check the footprint
Check the voltage matches, the max current on the driver isn't higher than the LEDs and that the LED will fit the optic
yup
yeah thats what ive told him too, but at the end of the day its his choice
not sure what to do about his windows, i might reccomend him some black chicken wire to stop someone climbing through
i would reccomend a better kickplate for his doors and stuff but hes DIYed all this inside a shipping container
theyre going to live in a dodgy part of italy in a container home for a while. so he wants some security measures. ive reccomended him a electric cow fence + infrared tripwires + nvgs for dealing with boar
ive got a friend with a ¬£300 budget
yeah thankfully its not for me so im not super fussy
okay yeah i didnt want to insult but that looked goofy asf
midrange?
is that a really good pair?
well within budget
tht says 40 dollars?
also reccomendations please
cool thats doable, what would i display it through?
So probably not multiplier
I've got a 100 quid budget
The people I'd be using them against will have no goggles so no worries about having infrared light
But I'm pretty clueless on nvg
For the light I figured c8 IR
I'm looking to buy some nvgs and a IR light for use in a foresty area
heeeuughhhhh ü§¢
it curled around my foot
in my soul
i stood on a centipede barefoot once
Neon bulbs?
What are they?
Sometimes, my thinking skills are subpar
but thats 120 dollars plus 2nd hand resale after
its kinda scummy
ü§ë
i might get my uncle to buy one through his amazon account too
infinite money ü§Ø
or, i buy it, get the skillhunt refund, return it for amazon refund and then sell it for 50% on BST
unless my parents say no
it is, ive got an exam later today, by the time im home if its still around ill probably get it
saw jt on bst a second ago
im really thinking about grabbing that
Piooh I didn't realise they did mixes
What led do I get tho
Ikr
True, skillhunt offered it to me and I might do it for a xpg4/519a ec200
Is it not just free money?
When sofirn offers refunds via PayPal for reviews on Amazon, what's stopping you from returning it right after and getting your money back from Amazon too
i wonder how they get it
im so jealous of the flaired people
d3aa ti here i come
i deserve a little treat

would it work on any linear or does it need to be anduril?
Maaybe firefox just doesn't like it
Is convoy light website down?

github.com/stcarlso/anduril/tree/ultra-low-mode
<@137363644932423680>  that covers most of it i think
judging by time zones youll have to wait a while
Like deep sleep mode having more or less leakage Vs fully on
If I had to guess, different on/off states for the MCU that have different leakage currents
someday ill build a headstrap for both at once
ive got two ns59s'
If there was one Hank in one config that should be absolutely mandatory to own, what would it be
id prefer a slim but powerful l21b host as a LEP (no sharp ridges to catch on pockets) and the flashier thor 3 host for a sft40 or sm
ive always wanted to do an internals swap to a l21b
not my 1800k gtfc40 starting to look cold
but 5000k being warm üíÄ
true
Man I'd get robbed so quick in some parts of London at this time of night
I've got a lh351 or xpg4 or something for the l2s
The round die and l2s are separate üòÖ
Eh I don't have a host for ut
6500k
üòé
Yeah
and the weird d4 knockoff that salty (i think) got
got a pink trustfire l2
couldnt wait any longer
ah i went with ws5050
one has the bad beam iirc but the oher is 3000k only
which do i get
<@140540414154375168> do you know much about the round dies
ooh really quick before the aliex sale ends, what round die 5050 LED do i get from the silevr ingot store
i want oneee
bright asf
damnnnn
whats your brightest light? what bulb is that?
so other than that, is it any good?
thats the issue tho, i dont need night vision at all
is it worth buying if i dont have any use for night vision
how cool is infrared
Maybe 6500 or 5700k 519a d4k
D4k or d1
I should probably pick one up
Yes but I don't have a Hank üò≠üò≠
already copped some TIR, and plenty spare LEDs
ill probably reflow a spare switch
is it the same switch size that the c8/s2 use?
i think i am already
might actually splurge
stephen! want a new best friend?
maybe ill splurge tonight 
nuns 5 minutes ago
i dont even have that much money in the bank üò≠
well now ill have to get it
ooooh
~~hey nuns looking for a best friend to share a hobby with??~~
good deal tho
aw dang
pheew
also <@136231916469878784>  this is calling for you 
oop, what would you reccomend instead
welp
they only need it for a side project im told, probably full body tracking for vr
they wanted cheap, 2 cell, 2A per cell, small
i hope i did well
i recommended the pb2s, small, cheap, fast enough charging, very useful outside of pure charging
lesggooo
cause i like flashlights
someone called upon me for charger advice
So possibly anything with dynamic current not just a set current pwmed
So what should I look for to get it to work, because I didn't realise there's a diff from 7135 to linear
Doesn't fet plus one mean fet and linear (7135)
Linear and get?
I gotta pop open my sc31
So yes for ts10 in theory
Or a fc11c
Like could I get this on my sc31 pro
Does this apply to every light or only certain ones
DAMN
Sc31 pro, rider Rx ti, l21b culpm, GTA, ns59v2, rot66, s21d 5000k

That's only lights I've owned but I could keep it under ten even if I include others
I think I could comfortably hit 10 if I needed
Not on my car
Not even constant current üñêÔ∏èüò§
Pwm
Those headlights
Not cause the windows or any of that noise
Cyber trucks rubbish
Issue is the optic would be hard to get out
And then cast the silicone
Only option is to cast a optic in something
Nah even then
No clue was the RI of the silicone is, no way to have smooth walls
There's no way I'd get it right
Thought about it more
i can trace and revolve
how precise does it need to be
fine
awwww theyre actual curves
yeah i just cant figure out where to find one
carclo-optics.com%2Foptic-10194%3Foptictype%3Dtir%7D is this not enough to cast?
price isnt a issue
any source for a 50-60mm TIR as well?
im trying to find a CAD model to diy it, ill check that out
which is closest to the nichia UV in the s2+ from convoy?
i share it more to laugh at him than anything
Mr " 10‚Äôs of thousands of dollars worth of testing equipment" but cant get molicells
i would agree ü§£
i wont buy from him again
kinda, he claims they were spot welded and then taken out of a pack without being used as the customer cancelled on him, idk if i belive it but $1/cell is okay
[shrump](
same for lojik
it was too late to get my money back, so no point pushing him to give me something
cool stuff tho
and has very expensive equipment??
garys made a custom battery?
"So I finally got him to respond, and what he offered me was no Moli‚Äôs at all. Not the P45B nor P42A.

He said he commissioned some batteries that are 4000mah & 40A continuous. He said they are testing great and that the company is reputable.

He also said he has 10‚Äôs of thousands of dollars worth of testing equipment that shows that they are really solid.

I said bro, what happened to Moli‚Äôs tho? He said they stayed stuck at customs and never arrived, and that he wouldn‚Äôt have those anymore unless he found a new supplier.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I said ok man, just send me the ones you had made because he offered the 50% more thing too.

So I ordered 10 P45B‚Äôs & 5 P28A‚Äôs. But neither would return. He offered a refund for the 18650‚Äôs if I wanted. But I said how bout just swap them all for 21700‚Äôs instead. He said ok.

So from 15 Molicels I instead have 24 Cybrwerks 21700‚Äôs coming.

As long as they aren‚Äôt cheap unsafe junk and actually hit and hold their numbers, then koo with me.

He said all the ones in the wild he‚Äôs sold are doing great. And every test he‚Äôs ran has been solid and he sent me some info on that. So meh, $2.15 a battery is is hard to complain about if they are what he says, soü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüëç

Just wanted to update you and say thanks for keeping me updated on your progress and ultimately for helping me to finally get some kind of order on the way from Gary.üëäüëäüôåüôå"
but its really odd
lojik got gary to promise him a shipment!
A few cobs did do it easy
What's the application?
ive just been trained by my family to know all sorts of movie references ü§£
lmk when i might nab the s6
Fuuuuuck the projector turned on and let out a teeny wisp of smoke before all the fans turned off and I have no clue where it came from
Where's my "good luck" üò≠üò≠
I've now moved everything onto surfaces that I checked to be insulating, made sure all safety switches are depressed and detangled most wiring
<@1246544192058953758> new test setup
Working on the searchlight more, what are these two components
maybe a 3x21d
a few cobs for work lights and UV
a few cheapo crap lights
got a couple things lined up to buy
im excited for the aliex summer sale
can i throw it in a normal bin after
might give that a try
ive got some spare glass
around 6.5s
<@1246544192058953758>  ik its been deepfried but you can see a flash from the spark
Otherwise I can setup a couple toggle switches for a separate fan PSU and bulb psu
But this would let me power on and keep the bulb off and have adaptive cooling
I'll see
And I don't wanna fuck shit up
True but everything here will handle the cooling for me
Everything mandatory (minus one or two bits I need to reverse engineer/check before removing)
Ig that's why there's two disticly different types of plastic here üòÄ
Ah that makes sense, it's right next to the HV stuff
<@1246544192058953758> might've found my sparks source, either plastic or screw somewhere
Why's the plastic conductive üò≠üò≠
When I'm home I'll get the original and upload
I must be tripping but sometimes I watch and I see the flash form the spark super clearly and sometimes it's invisible
Hang on
Lemme resend it
Should be a large spark on the vid
Ooooh mystery
For the full HD non compressed video
I think I dropped a screw in there, it didn't short a hour ago
<@1246544192058953758> 
I'ma grab a witness and power it on
Fair nuf
<@1246544192058953758>
Or should I find something thicker
Good enough?
What's the worst that can happen eh
Yep
I'll stick some plastic between them
Meant to be 250W or something
But yeah they're thin
I can't remember üò≠
One sec
Like can't be touching
Odd that the bulb is powered instantly but makes sense that it would arc there
And it was instantaneous at startup
My mum was watching and she said it looked like a flash (no smoke) and happened near the ballast
<@1246544192058953758> do you know if the bulb wires need to be separate
Idk tho it was pretty instant
I think it's the bulbs wires crossing
Oopsie
Blew the circuit
After I get everything out the main case I'm gonna work with a multimeter to see what PCBs aren't essential and are just breakout boards
Unfortunately there's a daughter board carrying a thermistor and a fan plus some other ICs so I think it's going to be mandatory to keep
Then I'm going to work on getting the IO board out
It's still partly in the case as I need to test if it power on
Heavily stripped down projector
Yo <@1246544192058953758>
Any chance it's that electric film that lights with power?
Nah doesn't look like trit actually
Or trit?
Definitely isn't a powered part?
Also custom PCB or modded stock driver?, and did you make it unduril?
Would you weigh in on the buck Vs fet being identical on 3x21d debate going on
I don't know if it'll be as much use to you then, but if you look up "physics and math tutor GCSE physics" and find the electricity topic they have some nice resources
Hey deci is English your first language?
Hey <@544931397048205312> is it you with the 1mcd 3x21d and like 50A current driver
ohhh
me?
https://convoylight.com/collections/3x21/products/convoy-3x21d-sbt90-2?data_from=collection_detail
wheres fet ü•∫
Gotta test that at the lake sometime
That's pretty sick
huh how do they do that?
Okay ü•≤ü•≤
Fuck me
but dont have a proper holder
i wanna use it for a couple hours
can i solder to the ends of a 400w halogen bulb
i thought it was a personal recent orders
ohhh thats how that funtions
where? whats wrong with that?
trust me id knock it
id have to carefully align it so all 18650 and throwers and 21700s could be held
i could make a magnet strip and use that
ooh they all have magnetic batteries
if all my lights had magnets id do it
just know id knock themm all over too often
maybe ill do something over my new desk
i use the floor
yall have shelves?
Did you get it?
You can do that for keywords?
its the only part of the language im good at
same, i love finding links from my lantin vocab to modern words
out of a class of 4
came top 4 in my school üòé
you wont wanna hear more from me ü§£  my latins atrocious
me when latin
i stopped learning latin in school last year but i feel like a sleeper agent anytime a piece of vocab comes up
shouldnt that be quanta pecunia?
i see, so it affords more flexibility in design
whats the point
does the double sidedness not ruin the thermal transfer?
I want to start investing but tax laws are funky for people with dual citizenship I think
The rest into flashlights/ hobbies
70% of my pay goes to savings
But I'll have my brother open it up and tell me
They'll arrive right after I leave for school which is a shame
This summer I'm getting back on it
Can't lie if I actually started working again id have a fatttt budget
Ah yeah that's fair actually
My collection isn't even small üò≠
why am I the lowest budget üò≠üò≠
Not great
That'd net me maybe 8 quid
so thats tracking for 20 cells
gsry confirmed it weights ~3lbs
his website lists it would be more accurate
tbf he does sell high performance copper busses for EV
well
gary shenanigans
Fingers crossed they get here tomorrow

WAAAAAHAAAAAY
aw sick
what can i say im just a sucker
christ
sorry
twss
hahah damn thats sick tho
got a link?
i dont think so, couldnt find much with google either
like fallout 4 edit? ive been meaning to check that again, my current modlist recently doubled in size
mostly using, i very rarely make my own from scratch
shits fun
i just really love modding
i think i originally got into it for the modding
you play fallout much?
yupyup üòÖ
ui's orange too
i modded it, all lights are a pleasant warm 3000k
im on perma nighttime too
not me playing fallout 4 with my 1800k gtfc40 for lighting
gonna use two motors in parralel
i fucked up the spinning platform part tho

Why would you say that üò≠üò≠üò≠ü•πü•πü•π
NUH UHH üò≠üò≠üò≠
NOW IF GARY WOULD SHIP MY BATTERIES ID BE A HAPPY MAN
And for the sickass colour
I got it mostly to expand the brand name collection
Coool
Got the pineapple mini, it's shipped to my grandparents tho so it'll be a while til I get it üòÇ
We should do weekly vcs
Was there a second?
I'm buying something cheapish to celebrate passing my driving theory first tru
Pineapple mini or blue fc11c
It's a shame I can't get anything nice off a phone cam with them
Since these are really high quality
Or adapt a lens for the z1
I'm gonna see if I can make a zoomie attachment for the sc31 pro
Cool
Once it's out I'll get the ring inside
So I think the call on the hidden screws is right
Those were to get it out the large element
For fun
Phatty
Yeah there's a 0hatty
Still can't open this guy
They seem to only be good at macro stuff
Hooray
I'm sawing through this delicate optical assembly
Fuckit
But I don't see anywhere to use it
I've got
Yeah hang on
I've got a lnsw10 lens assembly from the projector but I can't get it apart, any suggestions?
Maybe I'll get a super nice convoy z1 replacement lense
Gonna disassemble further tomorrow
Idk
Not to a point
Or even what they're focusing to
I can't figure out how they focus
What should I use the lenses from the projector for
you can have my lucky solder too
not even if i lent you my really good pair of tweezers ü•π?
could do the chip custom too, itd probably just be worse than the current best

Bruh I can't find the photo on my camera roll
No way he shipped 20 rocks for 40 dollars üò≠
Sure has
Cheers stephen
Oh that's what the number is
MY 20 BATTERIES WILL BE HERE SOON
GARY BOUGHT MY SHIPPING LABEL
LETS GOOOO
Nahhh torches last longer
The kind I'll cannibalise for a light
Do I burn it on a new light, new mod parts, new tools, or buy a projector
I've got 50 quid
It's got actual useful throw for outdoors
But it's a much more useable light now
My slice was imperfect
More visible shift tho on a white wall
And a warmer tint
4000k Vs 6500k
Warmer
Much throwier
Raaaaah üòé
Successfully swapped a xpg4 into the wuben x3
Didn't bother doing refund
Ahh lots of people did charge backs
He thinks I'm the only one who didn't cancel
He ignores emails
Reddit message definitely
Did you not cancel?
im getting the batterys at $1 per
me too ü§£
since early last october
but ill get my stuff hopefully
really crap excuse
but now hes buying the label
gary came back saying his phone broke
12 days after i was told id get tracking for my battery shipment
YIPPPEEE
I'll drop a comment showing support
Blf group buy post?
It's a pretty solid spectra right?
519a? Sft40?
What is it
You can get the brass screw modules individually, lower power tho
Or l90 (round die sbt90 knock-off)
Ooh jaxman with LEP module and waiven
We should group buy and when we ship them out include some printed centering gaskets
Rip
I amnt
It's at home üòé
Oh no clue, I was gonna reflow if it wasn't
Huh
Lumintop GTA
Or should I swap a white W1 to green
Any round die 3030
Hm okay
3535?
What's the W1 LED footprint
What's the Alix store for kaidomain
I don't get it üò≠
Why the hate?
Damn, fair enough
Isn't it dead germs that make it smell?
I think that's a you problem
Mine don't smell dawg
It's so üò©üò©üò©
I'll never get tired of it
Hammered copper is so classy
wanna see
also, i cleaned the patina off my cuts10
yup
plus 20 is super cheap imo
i dont have a ts10v2 yet so its a double whammy for me
if i cant have a forest green ts10 ill have piiiink

HAH
yeah im pretty happy ü§£

Ah well
agh i cant find anything about the reflector
hey <@551463315919077391>  do you know the name scheme for mitsubishi bulbs, ive found a listing for a projector ending in 10m with a U3-130 bulb
yippee
heres my initial lost of projectors to watch
ebay.co.uk/itm/176353112105

ebay.co.uk/itm/404944366177

ebay.co.uk/itm/285813463841
im gonna go with short throw more likely to be elliptical
thats alright, just thought best to ask than to wonder
do you think a short throw projector is more likely to use a elliptical reflector
any spc to filter by for the projectors
Any point trying with the AA?
I'm gonna double check if shorting both works
Time to look on eBay
Fine
Ahhh crap
Very frustrating
Or should I start buying replacement parts
Is there a way to test the bulb or ballast with a multimeter
2-4W draw
Nothing
Trying blue
Nothing happening
Tried red
Pretty bad soldering but it'll do
Yeah
And how does that work, because I'm not supplying any power to this board
Okay
I'm doing it immediately
Does it need to be shorted after startup
Imma solder jumper wires on so I don't have to keep resoldering
Bah
Gah
But I've tried both and nothing happened
Bottom being the one closest to the main PCB or furthesr
For reference
I still can't figure that out
And which side
All 3?
Okay so which do I short?
Also I assume the one optocoppler facing the opposite direction would be a output so I should short that
3 opticopplers
We're yours the same gen as mine
Help
<@551463315919077391>  pretty please
Does polarity matter
Or across the ?choke?
These vias?
<@410163261137223704> how should I solder this
I can't get solder to stick
hey <@410163261137223704>  will it break if i apply power to those pins before everything else is powered on
so pin 4 gets the -ve wire from the power bank an the +ve goes to pin 3
TxD UART output  and SCI input are both irrelevant to me?
but im not sure what closed means?
and page 9 I think i want pin 1-->2  closed
i think iv got a gen 4
yeah page 6 
If not can I have some help hooking up the AA batteries
Like two of them at once
Would shorting two legs of the optocoppler help?
Yeah I got plenty of those
Ah damn that's fine tho üòéüòé
Oh perfect. So I'm predicted 4 A so 4.5gpa off the bat is ez
Would continuity check help show anything?
So what do I do now if the ballast is presumably okay
Since I'm applying for an American University and I live in the UK I have to sit the SAT on a weekend
Anyways, nothing looks amiss on the ballast, the small caps look fine, the diodes look okay, resistors are üëåüëå
Cause it's not part of the UK curriculum
It's the only time I could do this test
If everything is intact should I try the 2x AA thing
Ah gotcha
Surely my capacitor would've died too
What would happen when a rectifier dies? AC through the ballast?
Anything I should probe with a multimeter
Alright, on my way home from the SAT but once I'm back I'll have a look
Un shorted the one and re shorted the other
Yup
No üò≠ my voice is funky asf on recordings
But I'm done for tonight, bedtime
I'm really gonna need help with that
Okay
Can I test that somehow
I hope not
Shiit
Not both tho
That's with the 2nd shortes
No light
Didn't work
<@410163261137223704> / <@551463315919077391>
And that's it?
All done
Why's that work tho
One minute
Okay
Aw what
Let's go figure out my pinout
Alrighty
25ma when shorted
I have white?
Bad news, don't have
2.62V, should I test current across the leads?
Pray for me dancho
2 is easier üòÇ
So 2.6V input and then the resistors
Yup
Okay so 2 AA and in the 3rd bay 3x 33R across the contacts
Or a heater cartridge for a printer
What about using a speaker as a resistor
I really need more resistors
Sorry to be such a pain
I have 3
Crud
NiMH and alkaline available
3x AA
Lemme see if I still have the holder
I could do a few AA in series
I do have just not for use here
Sorry I mean none spare
No 14500 unfortunately
I have tonnes of 10kohm so I'd prefer those tbh
It's 33 ohm
Crap read them wrong
Is there a calc that'll take your list of resistors and target resistance and tell you how to arrange
<@410163261137223704> that's all I got, might be able to jerry rig a old pc PSU for 3.3v too
Also have a couple buck converters so I can do a non-discrete voltage
I have both 5v and 12v double isolated supplies and I have what looks like 10kohm (reads 9.7kohm), 3.3ohm and 1Mohm resistors
Lemme go look for a sec
Gotcha
So can't plug into ac
Hm
I can do 12v if it'll fit the resistors I have better
Briefly but I don't understand a lot of it
I don't think so, we'll find out, but there's no power button so I assume it's permanently on
3 in parralel
3.3k?
So what's it powering
It'll have LVP too
Or use a old dumb micro usb portable charger
I can DIY a 18650 holder
what would i do with it
i can just add a second psu
what were you hoping to achieve?
yeah
which part üò≠
1Mohm
if i need a 5v supply i have some sitting around, 12v too
not on my psu i built
i diy'ed the psu so it doesnt have any 5v output
the ballast?
please be clearer, which board
i dont have any, no
which?
honestly no clue
this pdf was given to me by a user on tlf from when they built their light
since the ballast is meant to work in a projector it has a way to idle and use a eco mode
they look like tjhis, <@551463315919077391>  and some people online say shorting the pins on one of them will turn it on
like component level? because i havent a scooby about the working of the ballast
or my psu
for the ballast
Gonna Google a bit more and find out
So I'm thinking I got the wrong optocoppler
But nothing broke
At all, powers on but the bulb isn't lit
Nothing happening
So
I'll power on again when it's dark to measure the focal length
Wanna power it on while light just for ease of setup
<@551463315919077391>  t minus 10 minuts
Shorting the optocoppler won't break anything if done wrong right?
Now to plug in to the ballast and test tonight
It powered un
Very boring
Good news!
<@551463315919077391>
Or is it gonna break üò≠
Are you just saying that for fun
Don't fw me again
1-2 ohm across my old dmm test leads üíÄüíÄ
Also <@194014310555582464> thanks for the recommendation this ut60s is fire, I can operate the buttons ones handed and the auto ranging is niiiice
240kohm across the inputs
Time to plug him in
Yeah what Luna said, it's because I soldered and heatshrinked them incorrectly cause I thought the strip was positive
I messed up the colours DW about it
All done
Yup
And then putting in a new NTC current limiter
Haven't tested just yet, putting the cap and resistor back on
Which part?
<@130101943639998464>
ill try it
ohhhh
and then
what?
How do I do this
Custom PCB?
From the fire emoji I guess don't deadbug everything?
What do you guys think would be best
Might as well deadbug everything at this point icl üò≠
Hm
It's too big
Gonna snip it
Gonna have to cut
I think they bent the pins back on themselves
It's fucking tough
Still can't desolder the rectifier from the PCB tho
Hm
Nah visually they're fine
I think they had too much current?
Idk I've been testing without the ballast
Can I get a side of bacon with that
Bruh
A spare rectifier has .5v
<@551463315919077391> fucks sake my rectifier has a 0v drop across every diode
damn
what like bought a massive tub of epoxy?
maybe i have it cached
almost instant but the images take a split second
its about as snappy as id expect from a small seller
huh not for me?
i assumed he cut a deal for factory rejects
near molicell iirc or something
nope, arizona
it wasnt really, at the time the website looked legit
its past the chargeback date and i can test the IR
but eventually i got him to actually commit
and then it took another couple months
eh kinda drama, it took my posting in a few subreddits he frequents where i called him a scammer to get him to reply
his maybe-assistant
i dont see any addresses
nuh uuh
fingers crossed i receive my 20 cells for the ¬£18 i spent
yup üòÖ
ive held out hope
but they never shipped
i bought them on cyber monday or something last year with a good discount, it was a proepr looking website and everything
at this point, i dont even care man üò≠
finally
been messaging him since october last year usualy about twice a month
im nothing if not persistent
haha will do ü´°
not gonna do it rn cause my SO wants to call but later or tmrw ill get on it
alrighty
what should i measure across on the rectifier?
alright
blegh and blegh and blegh
so either my rectifier, capacitor or resistor are shorting ü§®
not the ballast too
thats just the psu ive been working with sorry
ohm-dear üòÆ‚Äçüí®
a fat whopping 0 ohms
Got one with buttons not dials
Lemme figure out how to use this dmm
I should do that
Not sure what the problem is
<@551463315919077391>
<@551463315919077391> <@194014310555582464> you guys are good with electric stuff right
Can get some electric advice. I've got a mean well ICL 16L but my circuit is 13A, would an additional 5ohm NTC current limiter cause instability or anything? was hoping the extra limiter would bring down the current to a acceptable level The device only draws this current fora split second to charge a capacitor
or go through your bank statements
rough estimates
time to start a public google doc for people to list the number of lights and value?
presumably theyll come down soon enough
Sooo watcha sending
And the fun of harassing Garry was worth it
It was only 20 quid
100 seem fair?
Sure thing
I forgor üíÄ
It never shipped since last year October
The cyberwerks black Friday deal
For roughly 20 gbp
IM GETTING 10 P42A AND 10 EVE 2600MAH 18650
HE SAYS IM THE ONLY PERSON WHO DIDNT CHARGEBACK
OMG GARY REPLIED
Then shield with my hand
Nahhhhh
I'll close the window as much as I can
First 35k feet l21b w2 beamshot?
Gonna try get a mid air beamshot
Boarded a flight
True but id ceiling bounce inside the display cabinet (white painted and small cupboard)
What's the benefits
But it's so much more expensive üò•
Then 30 dollar 395nm led strip or one of those grow lamp COBs
And I want to have a display cabinet, should I make a adapter for a UV torch so that it acts as a light fixture as well as a torch too or should I buy a dedicated light bar
I'm looking at getting a 395nm light for my uranium glass, do I get a sbt10x and drop it in a S2 or should I get a 9090 yinding and put it in a s11
<@140540414154375168> do you have a raw alum rot66
Hey <@346077022155440140> what state in America are you in
And I thought you replied telling me to get naked üò≠
I meant to ask what state in America
That's a good one üòÇ
Ohhh the joke just landed
Pardon üò≠
Hey Stephen what state are you in?
Hah yeah definitely, it's nice not having bills
It's almost 1:1 if we ignore my pension contributions
Learn ü§®?
If it's any consolation I do work on a crap-ish wage for these lights so
Low 30s iirc
Yaaa
I know sitrel said she day trades (maybe) to get money for lights but how tf does nuns do it üò≠
Nuns and sitrel fr fr
I know üò≠üò≠
Life ain't fair
No
Bruh
They have how many!!
Figurines can fit inside the large cases of the tank lights
And the steel cases can be used to store magnetic cap lights
You can put lights inside them
The tank ones are big
Military equipment is all the rage rn
I wonder if the guy selling tonnes of tank searchlights and similar is still selling
No spending limit? Just space?
Yeah
Wait nuns what's your budget?
You're right
First sbt90 and modern FFL in one
What's bad about it guys
Idkk
Ooh
"tailcap"
"what UI do you like"
You guys don't just short the Led to batt - ?
First thing I do when I get a new andueil light is stick it in the freezer and thermal calibrate and then set the thermal limit to 65 üòéüòé
Exactly ü§£
Still just turbo it üòÇ
Might be useful, I get lightheaded blowing on the lights to keep them from burning me
Huh you mean there's modes other than double click?
No thermal mass, can't buy it ü§∑ü§∑
Pocket sized?
Lots of high cri light in a very wide spread?
Too right üòÅüòÅ
Maybe I'll get my first Hank instead
I don't need one
Ah so it's basically rubbish, right ü´£
Oh well that's basically unusable i can't buy it, I'll get the discount ts10 instead
Yeah
What's not good about it
I want one
Idk if I can justify 60 tho
ü•¥ I think with he discount code it still comes out cheaper but that's still scummy if they did
I don't have any modern ffl
What's good on the sale?
I always do Taylor swift and barrack obama
Tag a celebrity
And the p45b did it too
No battery changed
Wtf
Crap the driver is doing it again
True, oh well it's happened with p45b too so I'll chalk it up to random funky issue that fixes itself
I wonder if my xtar is overcharging and the boost driver gets funky
Maybe at 4.2v it gets funky but once it drops to 4.1 it's okay ü§®
So why's it a intermittent issue
It's working fine
Okay now I look dumb
Is there a factory reset for the 12 group driver maybe?
Yeah üòî
It says 4.2v, the l21a usually has issues around 3.5-3.7v
But the xtar says it is
In America rn, I cant
It's definitely not a temperature issue
Can chargers charge differently? Is this a bug?
Today after charging (different charger than usual) it immediately steps down to a lower mode as if it's going into LVP
Yesterday it would run for a good long time on high and get hot and naturally step down
No change in battery
12v boost l21A
I have a issue
Is that discoloration from heat
S O L I D   B E A M
Yeah, that's how most filament dryers do it too as far as I know
Not even a food dehydrator?
If not, I think I'll try design my own and get JLc to make it
Does anyone know if the ts11 or other anduril wurkkos drivers of a similar shape will fit into the sc31 pro?
Is there a community designed replacement for the sc31 pro driver
Would you let them know I have a 100 gbp voucher for manufacturing via jlc
Oh <@140540414154375168> do you remember that micro charger
Hey <@140540414154375168> do you know what lizards look like under UV
cant do more than 1x 21700
the d4k is already 21700
oh gotcha, so its close to sunlight which is "perfect" but i was looking at it being close to or less than 0 not close to what it should be for 6500k
wdym, surely thats still subjective?
damn that sucks
ew
and itd be super cheap for me, quick enough too
i can make a couple pcbs with copper traces around the edge and solder them into one mega holder
i found a company giving 100 usd grants to help manufacture custom pcbs for students
ive just had such a good idea <@551463315919077391>  ive been stuck designing that bulb holder right
i was hoping to play with the uvc and hand it on without buying my own ü§£
cool cool
my brother will be visitng in less than a month iirc, hell be staying for a while then flying back to NC, i can have him bring it and ship if youd like
true but cheap led and filter
I'm gone see if they would part with the broken head
this one
might have details wrong, sakowuf was on the thread
i guess?
I'm hoping to buy the head of him if he gets a replacement
ah yeah saw that guy with a broken one on the reddit
ali won't load
is that the convoy, I'm on a flight heading towards <@140540414154375168>  rn üòÖ
how about the UK, my brighter is visiting soon
If not, can I run a Arduino on 12v and use a buck converter to 4v for the sst20s
I've got a sst20 triple board (parallel) is there a way to make it series?
Can I run 3x sst20 in series at 12V
Apparently there's a v2 PCB but idk how to get it
The springs got bent and the negative contact PCB got fuckrd up so I want to take a chance to renovate a little
And new springs and brass spacer for the mf01x
I still need to find the new switches for the rider
Lemme get that
You're right
Oop
Wdym
Could be, it's hard to tell visually when it's this wwrm
Yup, I leave it unscrewed usually cause the aux make it hard to sleep
There's without diffuser
It's on the brink of destroying all colour
Now 1800k looks neutral
I've got a orange diffuser over it
ü•∞
3k sft40 on the left
It's starting to look neutral to me
Reads as 600 on my opple with a orange diffuser
I'm daily driving a 1800K gtfc40 for my bedroom light
Is it Luna who dislikes warm lights
Smallest I had lying around üòé
How
2-28W range
I'm very happy for a weekend project
It'd be really fun I reckon
Might use a linear slider instead of rotary
I thought about it, I'd only need 1 set of precalculated values and then the Arduino would step through at different rates
Next steps are to add pot/encoder, use the 3 position toggle to choose on, off, timer and then add a pot/encoder for the time to dim over
<@346077022155440140> üòé
Then add a sunset feature
I think the next thing I want to do is code the adjustable brightness with a pot
10 minutes, 80% pwm, the copper slug increased temp by 3 degrees, the heatsink fins by no measurable amount
Honestly would be easier to just tap
The bracket isn't that thick!
but if it is ill tap the copper slug
its ABS and the heatsink is huge so i dont think itll be a problem
i considered tapping the heatsinks copper plate but idk where the heat tubes are
printing a pressure mount bracket think now
im using a massive passive cpu cooler
beatiful
1800K
yeah its just one gtfc40
theyre too bright
sooo thats fun, gonna change all the modes tho
but it did work
yeah im not a coder at alll
Eh imma go for it
Got me nervous that it's gonna break
<@410163261137223704>
But in the future I could add a pot for brightness
So the 3 position switch is fine as is no changes needed
Hang on
For the pot?
That was the original plan but I was told it's finicky to run on this Arduino
Oh Stephen said they'd be good with a internal resistor thing
So I assume, orange go to two pins, yellow to gnd
So in my code it says when neither connects go to med mode
In the middle position neither is connected
3 position
The ones I'm really using are these
It's the wrong type
Lo med hi
Nah its a 3 position toggle to select the mode
Code for reference
#include <Arduino.h>

// Define pins
const int modeSwitchPinA = 2; // Pin A of the mode switch
const int modeSwitchPinB = 3; // Pin B of the mode switch
const int brightnessControlPin = 9; // Pin for controlling brightness (PWM)

// Variables
int brightness = 0; // Initial brightness level (0-255)
int mode = 0; // Current mode selected (0-2)

void setup() {
  pinMode(modeSwitchPinA, INPUT_PULLUP);
  pinMode(modeSwitchPinB, INPUT_PULLUP);
  pinMode(brightnessControlPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Read the state of the mode switch pins
  int modeSwitchStateA = digitalRead(modeSwitchPinA);
  int modeSwitchStateB = digitalRead(modeSwitchPinB);

  // Determine the mode based on the switch position
  if (modeSwitchStateA == LOW && modeSwitchStateB == HIGH) {
    mode = 0; // Mode 1 (10% brightness)
  } else if (modeSwitchStateA == HIGH && modeSwitchStateB == HIGH) {
    mode = 1; // Mode 2 (35% brightness)
  } else if (modeSwitchStateA == HIGH && modeSwitchStateB == LOW) {
    mode = 2; // Mode 3 (80% brightness)
  }

  // Set brightness based on the selected mode
  setBrightness(mode);
}

void setBrightness(int mode) {
  // Map each mode to a specific brightness level
  switch (mode) {
    case 0:
      brightness = 26; // 10% brightness (25 out of 255)
      break;
    case 1:
      brightness = 90; // 35% brightness (90 out of 255)
      break;
    case 2:
      brightness = 204; // 80% brightness (204 out of 255)
      break;
    default:
      brightness = 0;
      break;
  }

  // Update brightness of the LED
  analogWrite(brightnessControlPin, brightness);
}
Should the outer two pins of the on-off-on switch go to 2 Arduino pins and the middle goes to ground?
Hey <@410163261137223704> realised I put a 2 position switch where I needed a 3 position
Awesome
I forgot to add the brightness toggle
Yippeee
So everything looks good?
Doesn't that go to the LED
I'll switch it to my power supplys gnd then
But fair
I don't really like them for permanent installations
Yup üòÇ
Just realised there's multiple gnd pins but oh well
How's it looking
Ignoring the uninsulated sections
<@346077022155440140> just finished the wiring
sorry, i did try it but i couldnt find it with the right keywords
Hey <@194014310555582464> what was the multimeter you recommended me
Can't find anything dang
On it ü´°
What range is acceptable
Time to look for a good enough resistor
Ooh I found a suitable MOSFET in my drawer of bits
ive also got to get a tap and die set for this project, any good budget brand or should i just try whatevers on amazon
im trying to keep it super simple, id rather stick to the resistor sorry
hey <@346077022155440140>  is the 10kohm resistor for the mosfet a special value or would 33ohm or 1Mohm work?
hey <@194014310555582464>  which DMM was it you reccomended
hmmmm
almost half the price for one vs the other but it has a reverse LCD
gate goes to pin9 and gnd (via resistor)?
i cant choose
it was those and a reccomendation from dancho
lygte-info.dk/review/DMMUNI-T%20UT139S%20UK.html


i had it down to 3
dang
i cant seem to find my links tho
too true
havent bought it
ive been busy this week at a university open event
so
ooh
gotcha
oh and pullup resistor for the switches, what value should i use
hey <@346077022155440140> in terms of electronics all i need is the 12v PSU, 10kohm resistor, 2 toggle switches, mosfet, GTFC40, and arduino
around the idea of special interests, id rather my teacher be autistic and have a special interest in the subject they teach than not if that makes sense?
i think nowadays its something to be prouder of
thankfully, hes a very technical and autistic fella so he'll probably be able to help
ü§£
will it help to bring this code to my teacher or is starting fresh best
then ill save you the effort of critiquing AI code
cool
it seems to agree with you every time ü§£
okay, fed the feedback to chatgpt, if those are all solved then ill be a happy boy. otherwise ill reach out to some teachers
does this make any sense?
makes it tougher
true, i have a lot of easy skills to learn on my own tho
unfortanutely i cant change to computer science for the next year and a bit of education until i go to uni
would that work for the 3 brightnesses and 3 time scales?
ill give it a try, if its all rubbish ill go to my teacher
use a reciprocal graph and just assume theyre close enough to look okay?
1- use 3 time intervals, linear ramp between logarithmic values at 4-5 points along the curve. then itd be okay?
i can dumb it down 2 ways
that is fair, but i do really love the idea of dimming
hm
üíÄ
its mem limit or the arduino?
it would make 9 lists of values
then precalculate for each?
i can do 15 20 45
would it simplify it by using 3 different time invtervals
oh i see, they dont bother doing it smoothly. just on......ramp quickly down
hows anduril sunset mode work?
hm
ill tell chatgpt to generate 3 different sets of pwm values to use then? and just apply them over different time frames
nevermind üò≠
should be log256 / logx ü§® ?
the logic is inverted again
<@346077022155440140>  that should be the code for dimming
then ill do that üòÖ
would adding a finaly switch help. so then it could be set the two toggles and hit the dimmer clicky switch and itll read the values
ah i see, it would read the timer immediately after moving into the next brightness
so if the indefinite requirement isnt fulfilled but b is toggled then you assume timer
would it, since the other case hinges around the indefinite power switch being toggled
im happy the orange pip kona328 worked same as a uno immediately
not bad, no errors. i dont have any hardware to actually know the code works but it on the board now
hey stephen should i be coding for either A or B hsppening or should i specify a order
ooh fun i uploaded the code so far
almost
big ol solid cis shell
no cracks
i wouldnt be able to do it any other way
ah yeah i noticed it rounded down 25.5 to 25 not up to 26
```
  // Determine the mode based on the switch position
  if (modeSwitchStateA == LOW && modeSwitchStateB == LOW) {
    mode = 0; // Mode 1 (10% brightness)
  } else if (modeSwitchStateA == HIGH && modeSwitchStateB == LOW) {
    mode = 1; // Mode 2 (35% brightness)
  } else if (modeSwitchStateA == LOW && modeSwitchStateB == HIGH) {
    mode = 2; // Mode 3 (80% brightness)
  }
```

this section should rather be

```
  // Determine the mode based on the switch position
  if (modeSwitchStateA == LOW && modeSwitchStateB == HIGH) {
    mode = 0; // Mode 1 (10% brightness)
  } else if (modeSwitchStateA == HIGH && modeSwitchStateB == HIGH) {
    mode = 1; // Mode 2 (35% brightness)
  } else if (modeSwitchStateA == HIGH && modeSwitchStateB == LOW) {
    mode = 2; // Mode 3 (80% brightness)
  }
```
i read it in case something leaped out at me as wrong but i wouldnt know whats good or not
yup
```
`#include <Arduino.h>

// Define pins
const int modeSwitchPinA = 2; // Pin A of the mode switch
const int modeSwitchPinB = 3; // Pin B of the mode switch

  analogWrite(brightnessControlPin, brightness);
}
```

hows it look? all reasonable
on off on then, 3 pin
[thinkank](
smart
<@346077022155440140>  when i have a 3 position toggle switch for the brightness do i want a 3 or 6 pin variant and do i want on-on or on-off-on. i can code it to assume when neither pin is connected to assume medium mode
anyways, focusing on core features
when i add dual channel i can try using a prebuilt driver and hijack it?
then itll be a problem for me to deal with later
never mind then haha
1 + FET
i have spare linear chip thingies
i could always add a single press button that enters a low moon
yeah i figure 100% will probably be too bright hence the 10, 35, 80
what mode spacings should i use
i want 10, 35, 80 ?
for 3 modes that are spaced evenly
alright, im going to gaslight an AI into coding for me and then come back with something i hope
unfortanutely, i dont have a ounce of code in my body, should i take it to chatgpt?
so hows the new flow chart
how is this
surely that implies id be switching it off and on again
yeah, what would be the reasons not to do that
presumably the LED will turn off and everything just waits for another input. i could add a toggle that turns the LED off when im done using it in the indefinite mode
ill have a lot of variables in the code then right
oh yeah duh at low brightnesses
is that not what id do with the 10kohm resistor
how come?
it occured to me, using a variable resistor instead of 3 position toggle to change the brightness would be easier since id have finer control and can do it analog without needing funny coding stuff
yessir
[kirb](
if only i knew how to code it
honestly doesnt need any precision
yeah thats fine
if a arduino can dim over ~45m then itll be good
and since i go to bed at varying times a manual set is good enough
for now i want to manually set it for before bed since i like my current alarm
but i dont
i dont need a rtc module do i, id only need that if i wanted to use it to wakeup in the mornings
im googling and watching some vids on the subject but im not sure im looking at the right guides for what i want
ah gotcha, more complex tho
10k resistor to limit the current, fet to switch it on and off at varying duty cycles and heat sinking ive got covered
tbh itll be running on wall power too so no point saving 3mA
not for whati intend to use it for
nope
later on id like to make it dual channel and do some fun ramps from cool-->warm-->off
yeah it wont really bother me
whatd be the practical difference
ive got a warm gtfc40, a arduino and a 12v psu. id like to put together a little box that uses 2-3 buttons to turn on the LED at ~3 discrete level and then set a timer for it to slowly dim over or to stay on until turned off.

e.g i can put it on medium to dim to off over 30m, or i can put it on low indefinitely

how should i go about making the code and bits- itd be my first project with arduino. ive got heatsinks for the LED and can power the arduino off usb or 12v + buck
then when 3000k came out i swapped again
iirc i swapped to sft40 6500k after a few months
due to LED or?
ive had it swapped to sft40 for so long i forgot lmao
Perfect, he leaves tomorrow
29.99 with next day shipping
Ooh I forgot about those
For my friend
Iirc it's a weekend trip
As long as it'll last a hike
Any
It's for a hike so I wasn't sure a ts11 would cut it
Maybe sc13?
I think sc31 pro, but idk much about this price range that's available on amazon
30 quid, Amazon only, what's a decent usb c, mid ranged any cct light
How so?
The Ntc are 10ohm at room temp, so there's not enough resistance to keep it at a safe level
Would that work
Hey <@551463315919077391> , if I do vir on the AC circuit i get 240/10 (Ntc is 10ohm at RT) so if I do two in series I'd get 12A current at RT and 3....

So if I use 3 it'll be well within my breakers rating
Otherwise all dumb bulbs
Rn I've tried out the TPLINK TAPO bulb
Ah cool
If they're swappable inside the fixture I'll swap them and then tint mix and print a white diffuser
Ty
I think my biggest gripe is it doesn't get dim enough
But yeah I dislike it, does a lot poorly
The orange is 3d printed just to make it extra warmer
Oh true, they are multi tint bulbs, but it's non standard I think so I'll need to figure out how to change them individually since they all change at once
I've just tried orange and it's no good, looks all washed out I'll get a pic in sec
And then I'd print it half in white or pink maybe
I'm leaning towards a hemisphere with a repeating pattern of holes so that it's not too tinted
I'm trying to think how to best 3d print a shade for it
My bedroom light is quite bright and poorly diffused, it's 4 bulbs in a square
cool
so should i get higher resistance?
ive got a 13A one iirc
If it's not high enough won't it still have too high a current?
The current limiter
some 10kohm
i see some 10ohm some 5ohm
how do i pick a resistance
okay so both of those numbers are in my range so i think its okay
<@194014310555582464>
do you know how id calculate it
what kind of resistance would i be looking for
oh okay so i could do it with one of these then
they are much cheape
plus i couldnt figure out the specs on those small ntc ones
I figured I'd get something nice and someday probably end up reusing it
meanwell-web.com/en-gb/meanwell-icl-16/
would this be suitable to add to my power supply for the UHP bulb ballast
<@551463315919077391>
why that one over the ones i linked?
like whats a good enough all rounder probe
like to buy
whats a good source for probes?
and <@346077022155440140>  ive narrowed my choice down to 
https://lygte-info.dk/review/DMMUNI-T%20UT139S%20UK.html

https://lygte-info.dk/review/DMMUNI-T%20UT191T%20UK.html

do you have any opinions?
<@194014310555582464> do you know about these?
im not sure which number to use?
ive done some math to spec a ICL, 
Yeah I'll have to cool all the electronics a lot
Cool
Would having active airflow over it stop it from working
I'd be more comfortable buying a limiter that automatically lowers it's resistance
Ah the way everything is setup now, the bulb powers on immediately
Looking at your diagram, in operation I would need to make sure that switch is hit before turning the bulb on?
Haven't done it yet ü§≠
Yeah
Oh would it be on the DC side not AC
That sounds complex
Eeeh
Since it's maybe 250W max (including margin for safety) it would be 1A 240V AC current limiter
Would I rate for peak current or average running current
do you know what spec i should look for
hah so ill be looking to amazon to get one of those
but that would all suggest i need a inrush current limiter
i tried a circuit sim and got 40A which is probably because i did it wrong
its fucked?
so as a professional would say
ah
assuming ive got the optocoppler correct, yeah. i dont have a way to look unfortanutely
yeah the uhp ballast
wait why?
<@551463315919077391>  wanted too check id built the rectifier right
Cooool
I have full access to Adobe programmes and autodesk
Hey <@551463315919077391>  I wanna make a proper schematic as best I can, what's the best program for that
Let me test with a inrush limiter from Amazon and if that doesn't do it then I'll move to HID
True true
The hid? Yeah
But I want this to work
True
So I'll keep trying the UHP
Probably all the safety issues that I have now too then
Oh gotch
33A at 12V is doable by a car batt
lightbulbs-direct.com/crompton-hid-400w-tubular-e40-mercury-4100k-cool-white-clear/
Is this not HID
But yeah inrush current limiter
Yeah I figured one of the 30k lumen 300W ones would be fun
What icl should I buy from Amazon?
I have a 12v car batt, I can rework it for a bright HID bulb and buy a elliptical reflector
If this doesn't work then It won't be a complete loss
Then I'd be okay
Yeah I just don't know, I think I'll try powering on with a icl from Amazon and if that fixes it then I'll start 3d printing some thick enclosures
Just all seems dangerous
I guess
Isn't that more dangerous
Surely I'm dealing with 340vdc and a few KV at the output
It is quite dangerous isnt it?
<@551463315919077391> I've been told to walk away from the Uhp light by a other discord group üòê, too dangerous and I'm too inexperienced is what they're saying
hahahah
i have a old 12v one thats very dented and will probably never be used as my 12v server supply is far more practical
not something easy to remove and repurpose?
any chance a meanwel PSU would have one?
gonna have a look at the dump tmrw for something with a inrush current limiter
but im 99% sure its inrush
tomorrow is a less busy day for me
noooo
Well bright
I can light the entire of the UK of from the left side to the right
very bright
have you tried the cue eight ploos
q8 plors?
anyways
had to send something to change my knickname üò≠
I knew something was wrong with your name but I couldn't figure it out!
Same price as the real store iirc
Got a link?
Lumens for use ability imo
Throw is the coolest
Xhp70.3 HI ns59v2 when ü§®ü§®
Oh is that a new Led, I didn't realise
In which case maybe I'll remove the bridge on the optocoppler, then retest
If that's not it then it'll have to be the ballast
I've got a rectify, a large smoothing cap and a resistor in parallel to drain the cap
I guess next I can do is power on my rectifier without anything connected and see if the mains pops
Agh
Otherwise all my wiring looks right oo me
Or will I be Amazon prime-ing a ICL
Would a lead acid UPS help at all
Inrush current ü§®ü§®
Yeah immediate breaker pop
Brb
Fair
So everyone's happy for me to plug it in again?
No open circuit
No short
Taking the rest of the circuit off and only probing the plug
Ah okay
Well no, but wouldn't the filtering stuff in parallel read as a short
<@551463315919077391> the test rig for reference
All good to go ahead and test again
But I have a holiday soon so I'll see what I can come up with
That's quite a bit to me, 5hrs work
Oh that's potting that got dripped
The HV stuff is done with crimps but I had to borrow the tool
With what's there, does it look okay
I know that switch shouldnt have been soldered but that's what I've got
I know but this'll do for now
All good
Setting up again
Just taken the switch out of the equation
Alrighty
Hang on so it's the switch right?
I don't think I want a clamp meter, they can't do resistance can they
Just hobbyist stuff
Around 50 ISH GBP I can go a bit higher. I really only work with DC. I don't really know the rest of what I need
Damn 70 gbp
Damn mine doesnt
Yours does üò≠?
Nah they're in the right spot
True true, whats a good meter
Nope 300 and by a lot more than 30, issue is kinda on me and kinda them sooo
20 days until pay day so ü§ûü§û
I know I know but I haven't been paid for a while, so there's not a lot I can do
Okay, considering the zero error of 1.8ohm and the l->n read 1.9 I'm starting to think it's my switch
Considering nothing happened except the breaker popping I'm hoping that'd be the issye
My meter isn't super reliable but I'll give it a try
Lemme go check
So remove the switch and test again?
There's also some filtering across the input plug since this is from a old computer psu
Could be the switch I wired wrong
So using the continuity checker, there's a short across live and neutral it looks like? But would that not be because of my resistor in parallel to the cap
That'd be across the PSU input plug I'm checking right
Lemme go check
Yeah a few computers etc
13A is what my dad says
So I'm thinking it's the inrush current
It's either inrush current or my switch is incorrectly wired but I think thatd make it burn up
Breaker tripped but nothing looks damaged
Small complication
sooo
i have plugged it in before with just the smoothing cap and havent had problems
should i?
tape down the bulb, desk fan blowing over it, everything sitting on tiles in my backyard
the setup is gonna look so ghetto
ive also got 2 fuses in the power line plus my breaker, so fingers crossed the worst that happens is the bulb breaks and thats it
cheers
its on the unit as a extra layer of safety, ill be well back when i plug it inot the wall too
ive wired one up to the psu
like normal psu switches
is the I or O the on for switches
fr me to my dad before plugging in the psu
okey dokey ü´£
ive got 30m to watch telly before i go solder my last connections and then set up
<@551463315919077391>  i just need to short those optocopplers, right?
ill have my dad video fram indoors, and ill be aroun the corner until he tells me its all good
ill phone my friend a couple km away
hahah i dont think so
might get some really shoddy beamshots tonight
gonna put the searchlights frame over the bulb and place a polycarbonate sheet over it
just found out polycarb will block it
ahh okay, ive just heard that it can burn stuff super easily, a moth getting burnt in half would suck ü§£
the real deal will have polycarbonate sides
ill be 10m away around the corner and will be waiting 5-10m before i approach it while on
what can i do to protect them?
no window, just reflector
the UV output is still scary
i need to measure the focal length
alright im waiting for it to get dark
these wires just feel awfully thin
ive sat on it for months now sooo
it says its reaaall üò≠
üò≠
psu explodes ü§®
will wrapping in heatshrink help? i only have shortish length
gonna just solder bridge
but i know which to do first
noooo
<@346077022155440140>  this is the ballast
ill be sat well away outdoors when it powers on, and ill be plugging it in from around the corner
thats whats on the ballast bruh
the case is grounded tho
its why i dont wanna power this on
i know üò≠
then a normal ABS will be safer
not particularly but its the only wires ive got that are thin enough for the jst xh connecor
id probably be better of 3d printing a case in a ESD safe PETG
cool cool, the only thing im really worried about is the output wires are very near some sharp metal parts of the PSU
i thought its 1mm per kv
can do, i just worry itd shatter the reflector, idk if its tempered
guh üíÄ
up to 20kv
around 5kv striking voltage
since its striking a arc until the metal heats up enough and then it goes to ~60 iirc
from aliex
18awg silicone iirc
its some crap stuff
mine doesnt have that üò≠
this thang is scarrrry
i thought it was a few kv startup
And the high voltage shouldn't get through my wire insulation right?
Gonna stand far away when powering on in case something breaks
Idk about c and b
Wearing polycarb glasses for the UVA
And imma try find a thermistor to measure temps
I'm gonna do it outside on a wood board with a large desk fan to cool it
What precautions should I take
<@551463315919077391> today's the day I'm done chickening out of powering on this Uhp bulb
anduril, water proofing, durability, simplicity etc
i like my deep red c8+, kinda depends what you need apart from red light tho
all my past reflows have been soldering iron ones, where ive heated, removed, fluxed, replaced and then squished all in one big go
then heat
ooh smart, remove them all, cool down, apply paste and place new
would you do them all at once and use a peice of cloth wrapped something to squish them, or would you go in clusters
how hard could it be
Hmu when that happensü§≠üòâ
i got into lights after the xhp35's hayday so i know nothing about it
how come its crap?
if they reject it i might try again with a different email
but i didnt word it like i was a business
ive sent a request for 10 samples in
the black one?
yeah, just sat down at my pc 
omten.net/ps090-push-button-switch/pbs090n-torch-light-push-button-switch.htm
Hahah, went for a hike of sorts and saw this location
Next beamshot target
AHH I sent the wrong one, when I'm back at the pc I'll send the other
omten.net/ps090-push-button-switch/pbs090h35-torch-light-switch.htm
omten.net/ps090-push-button-switch/pbs090h35-torch-light-switch.htm
hey <@346077022155440140>  about the switch upgrade for the rider rx, are you familiar with the two switch types, could you tell them apart by eye. i think ive got two switches in the right FF but idk which is which
ive got a raw ano ROT66 and yeah irl its a beaut
Yessir üëç
Yeah, I've found two omron switches that j think are the right size but idk which is reverse and which is forward
Since I use built in charging I'd say at the top of the spring to maximise contact area
Copper space better on the end of the spring or at the base
Gonna try replace the springs with becu ones and a copper spacer
And my mf01x springs are bent and tailcap screw is stripped
My rider Rx is still not assembled, gotta get around to buying the new switch
Exciting
I'm gonna upload mine tomorrow I think üòÇ
*you know you want it*
i can even have it shipped to you domestically since my brother is visiting
ill sell it to youuuu
l21a uv deathray?
ah gotcha
how do the HV (4.3) exist?
Then it could work in the light
I imagine the sag would take it down to 4 ISH volts
Could a manufacturer make a 5v li-ion 21700
I would but the extrusions are much more expensive than using tubes
I could, just don't have any filament to hand
And now I'm too pussy to turn on the bulb on case shit breaks, and I don't know if printed ABS will survive the bulb
Right as I fixed a lot of design problems that require reprints
And now it's broken again
I've had no printer for ages
Progress is so slow it's killing me
For the UHP
Bigass lense
im not touching a glued driver
ill do e21a mule
fuck right off
dang
never touched a hank tho
ive done a few full swaps on a simon with shelf
how much harder is hank vs simon?
tho, if the drivers are compatible i can driver swap and put a single fc40 into the d4k?
but not that far
im all for modding
ill get the e21a mule then üò≠
2000K e21a?
if not, whats the warmest mule i could get
is there a way i could get a gtfc40 anduril mule
just get a massive version
easy reflex reflector
wait so what was swapped?
slightly thinner mcpcb?
i tried to for a couple of my multicell lights
its good to know if youve got lots of one cell so you can give the best ones to hotrods
i usually go to 3v
yeah
2.5-4.2
Not even night mode or foggy
The blue W1, or w2 j can't remember which exists, looks so sick
Z1 more so since you can change the intensity and beam shape super easy
Id go c8 or z1
ah gotcha, im a student too. everyone knows if they ask how im doing theyll get a shipping update for my torches üòÖ
what do you teach?
this would be cool to analyse a high cri vs low cri LED
this is a sft40 m1 thrower
thats fair
I shipped it without but he asked to have it to on with mode memories
But he wants it on
Id agree with you
Showed my bro some UI stuff
yeah thats what i concluded ages ago. i cracked it up to a mosfet or solder joint
yeah
not sure, its been a while but it wouldnt reliably turn on
what to do with a slightly broken if25a head
nightwatch prices --> nightwatch quality
also. a full blue ns59 would be kinda funny
and im seeing a lot of dust on here. i need to remove that
the corner of one LED isnt even coated
the pours on these LEDs is so bad ü§£
yeah it looks like two dies will survive
it was from a giveaway and from neal. listing said ssq60 but im not surprised its the wrong one ü§∑
how would it short?
in theory, i could just scrape off the phosphor and live with the blue tint
originally it was dust, set it aside to clean but the gf managed to get it and turbo for a few min before i warned her
what should i do, repair with another identical LED or replace all LEDs with xhp70 or something?
one LED in my ssq60 ns59v2 has a burnt spot
Is this something I'm not hank-ed enough to understand
I'm lost üò≠
What is it?
how soon do you need those?
or even cooler would be GITD 3d printed spacer
Maybe I already sliced mine the
Wait
I swear the xpg4 is already domeless how would there be a HI
A M1 with gitd gasket, sft40 5000K, 8a 3v buck driver, spring bypass, doubled up o rings and custom finish
get the black cslnm
ahhh its alr for me tho. i do at least already have one ffl
i have 8 üò≠
dewit
üò≠
im too broke
SAME
oooohhhhh
60 usd if you get rainbow and ffl LED
yeh
30usd total?
check the ingredients
idk about yours but my one leaves a layer of ptfe iirc
yeah any of isopropanol, rubbing spirits, soap and a sponge, degreaser
not even when weighing by difference?
Yeah
Oh yeah remove the electronics and o rings and wash well
Every piece went in at once, used the top heating element to get a slight gradient in temp
To turn it from black to bronze, I baked it in the oven at 280c and took it out every ten or so minutes to check the colour
Ah thanks, I'm still not feeling the sanded look
It was originally plain black
But the gradient it actual fire. I'd do it to all my other lights
Yeah it was initially just baked, then I tried copying this 
I can guide you through getting a similar gradient effect tho if you'd like
Not selling this one sorry, usually I would but it's a gift
Yeah km sad I sanded it down
But someone had beam shots recently, check the channel
I'll have mine soon in case someone else can't
It now looks tacky
Sad day
Tried sanding it and fucked it up
Baked my my light and got a sick gradient
not a dealbreaker tho
yeah
problem solved
deep carry places it at the bottom of my pocket
it sits in my pocket better, otherwise things work their way under the light and push it out
Fair fair, i try not to give advice too often but sometimes I see some really dumb takes in the comments of Reddit posts. Tho I made plenty of those when I started collecting
Not me checking all my past comments to check if you've questioned me
Oh who and what
and the central hole is present in most TIR
yeah that thing in the top left is from the molding process
nah but ive got a couple prototype hotends that i dont need
if im ever in peru ill bring ya my spares üòÖ
ah nevermind
i can never remember, are you UK?
id be able to run 2 per day
i hope to crank out full cosplay helmets in about 5 hours and sell them on etsy to make back my investment
jupp, check out vez3d on yt to see what it can really do
cost 2k ü§ë
ah yeah its a custom build
current acceleration of 46,000mm/s^2 but thats the minimum inout shaper reccomendation
it scans the bed with a cartographer probe at 500mm/s and measures 81k points
eventually itll crank out parts at 600mm/s for rough parts
built it a bit ago and im still going through the teething phase
vzbot
it should be doing 300mm/s perfectly without all this ringing
but yeah anything over 150mm/s and the quality dies
im cranking out a couple prototypes for now until the weekend since i dont need these to be perfect
its got a lot of problems
yeah new printer issues
Public insta account with that name
I think it is üíÄ
Gonna make a few small changes but it's pretty much perfect IMO, the mounting holes will make it easy peasy to set up
The bulb holder I designed works, well centered and very secure. I'm gonna have it MJF printed in nylon
Wanna see something cool üòé
<@551463315919077391> I FINALLY HAVE A WORKING 3D PRINTER
Ah I forgot to check that
Is it 20mm and 20mm
And driver size?
I can't measure mine rn
What's the convoy M1 mcpch size
reflector too so slightly throwier?
none of the ones ive bought are atually flawed, just old
I would kill myself so fast with that
No no no
Oh no
I can't but I could probably figure out how to make a 17mm anduril driver, the only part I'm not sure of is the switch is a clicky and not a eswitch
I need to check in the morning
Oh good point about the z, maybe a larger flex pcb
Would I be able to make a adapter PCB, 2 layers. Bottom flows on like the original and then uses vias to get to the top where the t85 goes
Worth for anduril
Hey <@346077022155440140> reckon I could flow on a new MCU and it would work?
ts10 pcb and then a 2nd spacer and ts10 driver
i reckon i could mod this light to work as a eswitch tailcap
daym
thats so much
sorry i aske <@140540414154375168> , didnt realise what i was asking for. thats far too much work
well never mind
thats fair. i know the asnwer is truthfully "depends" but what range of time do you think it would take for you to have it working assuming i sent you the light
i say: convoy 17mm buck driver is good enough
chat gpt says : Given these factors, a rough estimate for a novice to port And√∫ril firmware to the 3AQ20 MCU could be around 3 to 6 months. However, this timeframe can vary significantly based on individual learning speed, the complexity of the firmware, and the availability of support and resources.
how much work is it?
i dont have a eswitch convoy to crack open sorry
i assume this is what every maeerxu uses
this is specifically the maeerxu df02
like what others would it apply to
wdym
andurillll
sooo
driver pics for fun
üëâ üëà ü•∫  <@140540414154375168>
i can live with no mode memory
yeah i rarely change my settings
if im flashing does it mateer, i can just pick my settings now
ac
what about sram
oh neat i think this has a capacitor on board to power the mcu but i might be guessing wrong
the light does output temp and voltage readings with its aux
ooh can anduril work with this kind of clicky switch ui
i think so but it might not be flashing pads
7135 + fet driver it looks like
<@140540414154375168> reckon its anduril - able
df02 MCU
Anything looks wrong on the driver or mcpcb
Well that's no good
if youre after a hotrod then molicel is youre best choice which are unprotected
and if it has charging it probably has ocp
kinda, a lot of protected ones have over current protection
especially since the less common ones dont get all the new chemistry upgrades
yup
you could take a few 14500 in parralel and drive anything hard but itd be a silly ff
to be more clear, i think 18650 and upward can push most modern LEDs if provided the thermal mass and the driver is large enough. but a massive buck driver with a single 18650 would be silly
size constraints means that the unregulated drivers with mosfets are generally the only ones that push a LED hard
but every driver if specced right can push a LED
a boost driver and a buck driver change the input voltage and they can drive a LED very hard but due to size constraints tend not to
a regulated driver like 7135s makes sure a certain amount of current flows no matter what - like making sure exactly 10 people come through a door every second no matter what
a unregulated driver is a mosfet which is a electrical switch and dumps the batteries energy into the LED - like opening a door and letting a crowd through
its a little out of my comfrot zone but as i understand:
yeah
+ driver limitations
Yeah so maybe a large order would be worth it, but individual items isnt
Interesting
The Alibaba store is cheaper, the 2s uv c8 is 4 GBP cheaper but moq of 2
And Mr Mao Simon is their sales manager
That's the full company name
Dongguan Kangwo Yi Electronics Co., Ltd.
Pretty cool that you can see convoys business license on aliex
metal side switch + charging
thats kinda cool
hahaha wtff
bd?
reckon i can sell it as a rare collectible üòÖ
haha im so confused
the base of the reflector looks hand sanded
popped open the bezel
the only thing thats different from online pics is theres some black lines on the white around the LED
wait nvm theyre pretty similar
and i thought the LED looked like a sst40 not xml/2
i knew i wouldnt willingly buy a convoy side switch
worth contacting simon for a actual s6?
yeah its just not what the s9 listing says ü§£
click on, click to cylce low med high. double click strobe. hold for off
and it has a very different UI
is it maybe a new s9 revision
lemme get a pic
wtfff
waittt
and it came with clip and magnet
but theres 0 text on it
yeah thats the one
lighted side switch, has a space where the tail switch would go but it came with a magnet
side switch + usb micro charging
18650
cant view his whole store
hmmm
sratch and dent sales ü§£
lmao
but its a s8?? maybe
box says s6, listing is s6
i got thr wrong light!!
tfff
i thought it was s6, lemme double check
0 blemishes on the light afaik
scartch and dent s6 arrived, didnt realise it was a side switch. will probably chuck new LED and driver in and regift
I'm very much unfamiliar with the cree x.... Series
Possibly
XML HI?
That's fair
Just had a xpg4 in a sc31 pro
Ah not in a sk03
I found cutting the phosphor over pour off with a scalpel and slicing helped a little
hes gotten to grips with convoy UI but not anduril
but im looking to upgrade him
hes currently got a super cursed zoomie just as a absolute minimum spec for emergencies
nah hes smart enough to know to charge, ive sent him a charger too
scratch and dent for that sweet sweet price
im leaning toward a s2 for him then
its for my brother so im trying to find a middle ground light, pocket size and good for general use
not yet
his message makes more sense now
i didnt even see that lmao
ooohhh
is it still not clear üò≠
^^^
opinions on a convoy m1 with buck driver and sft40 for urban exploring?
oopsie, had to use dictation cause i was in a lesson
How's a Convoy M1 work sft40 and buck driver fire urbex sound?
reddit.com/r/18650masterrace/comments/1ao61hr/comment/kpz9286/?context=3
reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/1ansyek/has_anyone_received_their_cybrwerks_order_gary/
a couple other peeps here had orders too iirc, i finally got something of a response from gary
i know this isnt the battery channel but ill drop it here for visibility
If I had a UV led and instead of using a large zwb2 used a tiny one glued into the reflector using a UVA clear adhesive and then normal glass at the front, apart from being cheaper would it be as effective
What's the silliest hotrod I can put it in
I've got a single lishen 60A
And sofrin 21700 said 31
Lishen said 17 or 27 I think
At 1.5A the p45b both say 23
Hm
It changes with charge current
And my 4000mah 21700 from sofirn measure 32 or so
The p45b I have measured 23 and 26
My magic lishen measure 104 (the one I shorted) and 43
IR readings are funky
Ah that's fine
How hard could it be
Or do i
I don't need a quad l21b sft40 5000k
vs 
they sell phlatlights stupid cheap
Trying to find a wind turbine tho
So far my options are either a water tower or possibly a memorial
I've started looking for a good spot near me to test
Soon I'll be able to run the searchlight on the go
I have a 10 GBP battery on the way üòéüòéüòé
UPS acquired <@551463315919077391> , I found one with a dead lead acid battery outside a house
Also
is that a 7135?
and wham bam funky smell
so i opened it up
it got warmer than usual
yup, i caught it because the switch wasnt on and it wouldnt respond to button presses so i put it in to charge
New charger arrives then
I'll check the p45bs IR on Wednesday
Oh well
üòÄ
I need to desolder it, unfortunately I've learnt my only iron to a friend
So
Looks like an aux linear regulator died and probably failed closed
BUT
Thank goodness
Everything is working
Plugged it in to charge and came back
My mf01x self discharged to 2.5v last night
i always assumed the h was his last name
oopsie
why dry?
warm vinegar and salt has been pretty good at my brass without changing the surface finish
ill keep my eye out for something similar
oh cool
did they reach out to you? or you to them
howd you get it for free?
lke the dead internet theory but instead of bots its fake germans
haha no ones actually german its just people copy pasting translated messages ü§£
id rather be respecful than intrude in a german space
idk how to edit but i reup in english
ah shit i posted the english version didnt i
was my comment okay?
yup
we'll see
maybe resin will work
otherwise ill redesign it for sheet metal or cnc
ive got no clue what temp this will need to withstand so i reached out to those TLF guys you showed me, hopefully some ASA will do
for accurate mounting ill extend it to mount to some 2020 profiles hich will hopefully help make it self centering
centering ring with clips in grey, retainer in blue
what do you think of my bulb holder
https://cad.onshape.com/documents/2901a4f891d2e0cad27ceaca/w/6f2423352320b7b9a24abd85/e/440b6b688888317500689a31?renderMode=0&uiState=65be64a284b0766d6a6caa02
<@551463315919077391>  getting my 3d printer next weekend so i can finally make progress on this project
does this message make sense
Hallo Xandre,

Ich habe an einem Projekt gearbeitet, das Ihrem UHP-Scheinwerfer √§hnelt, aber mit den Teilen, die ich in Gro√übritannien finden konnte. Bisher habe ich alles au√üer der UHP-Gl√ºhbirne entworfen und getestet. Ich habe Schwierigkeiten, eine Halterung f√ºr die Gl√ºhbirne zu entwerfen, die einfach herzustellen ist. Welche Art der K√ºhlung haben Sie verwendet und wie hei√ü wurde die Gl√ºhbirne im Betrieb? Bisher habe ich dar√ºber nachgedacht, eine Halterung zu verwenden, die fast identisch mit Ihrer ist, diese aber im 3D-Druck nachbildet. Ich w√ºrde gerne von Ihren Erfahrungen bei der Herstellung der Halterung h√∂ren und Ihre Gedanken zu meinem bisherigen Plan/Design h√∂ren. Wenn Sie noch das 3D-Modell der Halterung haben und es teilen k√∂nnten, w√§re das sehr hilfreich. Hier ist der Link zu meinem Entwurf: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/19229385c649d8a76f45434b/w/3abfcb95dd25510155945f51/e/2d4f0a7e4be7850afe796c94?renderMode=0&uiState=65be44119cbdc4367fb1401b

Danke sch√∂n,
Matthew
will they be notified if i dont @ them
ill just ask in their thread
oh duh
gotta ask about their UHP bulb to get an idea of what temp it runs at
im hoping to either talk to xandre or andi
darn, is it wrong to just reply to the person i need to chat with in a unrelated post
how can i DM someone on TLF
Uelpt, spray isopropyl alcohol on your pillow so it's always cold
I want
Sp10 pro, 519a and a magnetic tailcap
I don't see why you can't put a convoy in
Haha that's fair, I just want more and more lights, I love tinkering
Jazman Z1 is in my bucket list for a red and amber LED and a round yinding
Direct drive to a sft40 now, lubed up everything and it's actually quite airtight and smooth
Random trustfire light
Or it's meant to more mean dunk? Like to dunk in the competition
Maybe they googled "gamer phrases" and slapped it on a flashlight
The way I've been chased through the park and kicked it would've been a deterrent
Yeah that's fair, in the case I was mugged then nothing would've helped
yep, i reckon i could maybe get a headshot if someone got up close and aggressive but im still running
not in a boasting way but he agreed since hes a fighter for money so it seemed ez. he flinches when a point my edc in his direction now ü§£
same, had a friend try punch me in the chest, he agreed to take any hit that isnt the face, strobed him with a mf01x and then slammed it into his side
has anyone strobed someone trying to hit them
my 2700k at turbo is basically moonlight to your 70000000k mid ramp
efficiency
or
good moonlight
its519a too
are there any other gold ano?
should i
oooh
why not?
My EDC is on moonlight now
Damn
Also it's weirdly geo fenced for the usa
I've got it installed but couldn't get it to see my lm4
Ah gotcha so I want opple home
üò≠ I
I'm in school
I opened r/flashlight and someone had their boobs out üò≠ and
Hey <@632481278368677888> do you know anything about there being multiple versions of the opple home app and one being better than the other
Light Master R.... E....
Got a server invite
has anyone heard anything from cyberwerks
he pisses me off too
im enjoying your replies quite a bit
test setup to measure output / time for my UV L21A yingfeng 9090 + boost driver
cool, how do you handle the time data cause mine looks to be complete nonesense
ah yeah gotcha
save as csv?
it sucks
cause ive got it open
what are the steps to fix it
Yippiee
Yeah how do I actually put it as a graph üòÇ
üòé
But
Gotta clean it up still and format it
UV torch runtime
thats for my c8+ knockoff üòÖ
who on aliex sells xpe cyan
no cyans tho
nah reds cool but ive already got 2 sst20 dr
yeah cyan would be sweet, that or lime are probably my options
If not I'll find a cool colour to try
Would that increase output
Awesome, I might flow another lh351b in and see if I can just put it in parallel to the other LED
What pad is sst10
Ahh I should've Googled that, that makes sense, and a TIR reduces red a little too right?
sorry for the bad pic
whys it so orange
isnt the wuben x3 meant to be the same LED
my c8+ on the left is sst20 DR 660nm
so drop me that shipping label and ill stick it in a envelope
ill be in the us next weekend
i wont get any numbers of uv power but ill be able to get an idea of the lights runtime and its outut over time
since drop in uv out ---> drop in blue light
yeah that was the goal
Not bad
14 minute graph
cool
unless things have a flouresence ceiling this would work right?
just output power comparison
Opinions?
Test method for comparing my two UV lights üòé, S2 seoul UV Vs l21a yingfeng
Honestly it's not that strong and never stays on my hands
Same, metal smell appreciators rise up ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
ill dm
done
what price?
ill be there in a couple weeks, what state?
USA?
UK
okay, some google and your advice gives me s4+ v3, vp4, c4-12
vc8 plus?
once im paid!!
limits to 2A total
yup
So imma head into staff training early and have a chat
But they don't understand the problem
Yeah I finally got my managers email
üò≠
So I'm having problems getting the other centre to see my timesheet
I'm a casual lifeguard, got a pay drop during a buyout and then the new system is funky since I'm employed by my local centre but work somewhere else
Little money
So yuh
But that's my fault cause I need to chase them, I'm going in for training so I'll do it then tho
They've not payed me for the past 3 ISH months so I'm owed a few hundred
But schools busy so I haven't gotten time to do more shifts
Yeah, I get maybe 200 monthly
Still gotta chase my employer about pay
I'll see idk man
Anyone in London wanna let me borrow their ir meter
Dragons 60 quid üò≠
Nah
When I'm a professional ill afford it but rh
Bruh I'm 17
I just need to know, okay to turbo in a ns59 or not
But
Yeah I get that
More!?
No
Brother
200 üò≠
What's a good meter or charger
I really need a way to measure IR better
Hm
Nah straight flat top
Nah
VC 4 won't charge p45b over 0.8A
Hm
Yeah my linear driver , on 2023 sept fw doesnt do it
sept 2023 is the latest im using
oh how recent
none of mine do that
what light?
bright flash ü§®
<@558837879023861761>
haha for work light i admit 5000k is nice
i suppose a sfy55 and a cpu cooler
whats a good store to find decent cri COB lights that are mega bright and a good store for drivers
yup
Or maybe my spare sft40 6500k
I wanna get it and swap a osramber or green LED in with a 12mode driver from Simon
bosh
add LED
drill hole
tell us if its a good reflector
go on
Anyways it's late in the UK
And if it matters to you, you can remove what I assume is a diode on the switch to decrease resistance
The swap is the convoy switch onto the wk40 PCB so that's the only soldering required
I'll get back to you this weekend
I can remove the spring on the switch PCB so that it'll fit in a letter
Looks like 2.4 GBP for the switch and boot, you don't even need new solder, just desolder both, swap and resolder
I think next weekend I'm in the usa, wanna buy a switch and boot for whatever cost convoy sells them for, they're unused
How do I do that
Are you UK
Spare bits and bobs from swapping to a lighted switch
I'll video it
A simple spacer would help, since you just reduce the overall distance it's able to move
Is the convoy switch too long of a press for you?
<@1012547652556165210> new boot, switch and old switch for reference
a screw driver at a angle, theyre not very tight
one sec
sure
yeah if you have the parts is ez, rubber convoy boot + omron switch
yeah the off center is cause the boot doesnt use a rubber nub and is directly interfaced with the switch and the switch has some lean in its stem
and i dit it standing up holding everything in my hands cause theres no space to put everything down
it took me 10 minutes from the time we last mentioned it to when i finished
the old switch was weirdly long and wobly
i fixed it
you said the wk40 switch was hard to cycle
ill put my amber xpe into my brass ts10
ill try the ts10 glass this weekend]
no no the wk40 switch
all you need is the standard convoy switch, a soldering iron and a convoy boot
ezpz
it doesnt struggle to cycle modes
<@1012547652556165210> love you bro, just fixed my biggest gripe
<@1012547652556165210> swapped a convoy switch onto the wk40, everything fits with a bit of fanagling, lemme try it and see how the switch feels
<@1012547652556165210> almost done swapping switch, looking good
any good uses for a old if25 driver
anyone seen my bezel tool
try the tape, it fixed it for me
a wk40 would prob need a new switch, lemme open mine
on the ts10, the back of the metal switch disc just needs a small spacer like a couple tape layers
the ts10 is more the switch doesnt have enough "tension" to return to its 0 position properly
my issue with the wk40 is its a short stroke
thats a different switch to the ts10
sp10 to ts10
hey <@140540414154375168> is it a 1 to 1 swap
stack mcpcbs that have the mask sanded
the sp10 is ac cheap, around 11 gbp on aliex rn
yeah what sitrel said, if you want the triple setup still you could just get a massive spacer which might improve perf, but otherwise just a straight swap
but i dont see why it wouldnt
nope
did you also get the uuuuhhhhh on impulse
oh yeah me too, my uhhhh, uhhh was impulse too
haha fair, same
thats fair, i dislike mine too
do you have a ts10 nearby
genuiney, stick a bit of tape onto the rubber boot and it makes it much more responsive
could stick a spacer under the mcpcb, a glass lens and a sp10 bezel
i thought it was glass
ah that explains the melty look on mine
just the tir
plastic?
what issues do you have with the ts10
yeah hahha
td01c?
ts10 v2?
ah your switch probably un seated itself a teeny bit
almost factory reset?
is that good?
Happened to someone else for a "pocket dump" showing a similarly themed but red torch + red zippo
That's a period pad no?
heheha
torch-trans-cendent
ooh
torch-transcendent
gonna machine it
ooooh
and so my hunt begins
your collection is awesome, where do you keep it all
which 5 are unique?
ah yup that does it
hey <@140540414154375168> out of interest (not in a undermining/questioning way) whatd you do to deserve torch gollum in your mind
vencord has a plugin for that
youre right
i figure the searchlight im not quite finished counts plus reflowing
or hire me ‚ù§Ô∏è
damn bruh does a pink emitter make you a gollum
kaidomain.com/Flashlight-DIY-and-Tools/diy-flashlight-shell-or-flashlight-host/Pink-S2-Plus-LED-Flashlight-Host-118mm-x-24mm
<@558837879023861761>
ah cool
any care about having a buck driver or anything like that
any clue what driver youd like
hang on, ill grab some links for ya
if its on their aliexpress store get it from there since the shipping is pretty speedy
i put a pink into a s2+ shorty last month, so ill just stick the same LED into the host
dw
ive got a pink spare
cool
if you ship a host +driver to my house in the UK ill stick a LED in for about 10 gbp? i think ill be in the US this month, but kd shipping is slaw as hell so itll be a bit until i can get it to you, im UK btw
<@701119955676037171> off topic but did you change your name recently, i recognise the pfp but not the name
uk? or us?
its decided
and putting my pink LED in
im buying
alr
Sp10 V3 for reference
I think I've got the wrong size mcpcb
It's sleaker
I prefer it over the A
idfk where i put i
its gone
the 2nd time i need my flashing kit
dang it
sp10 v3 arrived
Smooth light progress, I'm digging the smooth bod, it's a shame the solder doesn't polish easily so it's quite dull. The body is all fucked up from being EDC and roughed up by strangers
did he get worse?
polish a copper light with brasso or use vinegar and salt
ah thats a nice light, i cant see much about what driver it uses, any clue if its a boost?
maybe she was rewrapping a cell and adding the module diy?
iirc <@140540414154375168> was reccomending them for the ozark trail as a minium safety feature, i couldnt find one tho
protected 18500
which one exactly
3xaaa series or parralel
then again id have everything green if i could
the ts11 looks good but i wouldnt want a ts10
it doesnt fit a lot of aesthetics imo
huh im really not a fan of orange for most lights
jacket pocket?
or unsuitable
urbex?
thats fair, nothing exciting about it
also 8A charging!!!????
do i need it
oooooh
i doubt you would be, could keep it in a thread for cleanliness
if it isnt any extra effort to you id love to see your finds in the bst
aw dang id risk it and just chargeback
fair tho, if i was looking for a very specific item id do that too
i always try browse but i ont want to have to search brand by brand yk
howd you find it
ahh
i shoulda got that
dang
i know my mega throwers well
no the blind box sorry üòÖ
whats it cost?]
damn thats a huge difference
what do you think of it? i have the xhp50 rn
ive built a spacer with a 3d printed centering ring and a copper rod, minimal resistance
No battery included ü•≤
Sfq60.3 5700k
I'm still waiting on the cyberwerk order üò≠
Ooh nice
Gonna swap the ts11 and sc31 pro to sft40
Off topic but man I'm excited, 6x stf40 3000k, 1x amber xpe2, 1x sp10 V3, 1x wuben X3 and 1x ns59 allll on the way to me!
i got the white case and bod
ah is the black GITD too?
how long did it take for yours to arrive from order
juuust got my tracking
and the light
oh true, ive never held either. are they tiny?
thats not teribble but not greatt
3000 is about 1x 18650
And to try the cuboid form factor
I'm really excited to get a new edc
How long did it take to get your tracking
Oh sick! I've got a X3 on the way too
it refuses to work?
how do i add it
i heard the light master IV works better on the opple home app
Just got a sp10 pro and a xpe amber for a night light. Though considered the osramber or a yellow yingding or maybe the green die w1 I think
Ah I'm UK
Maybe
But yes, the reflector will need a little sanding but the bezel will fit and the new LED will too. The only dubious part would be the driver swap. But I think it's doable
Man is snug as a bug in a rug rn
Sorry dude, gettin into bed
tho idk what broken on your light, is it the driver? if it is you could maybe try a sp10 driver in there with reflector and bezel too
or alternatively, any of masternates multi LED mcpcb and make any triple]
alright, only mod i know of thats worth it to me at least, is using masternate's (i think) single LED mcpcb and putting a 519a / w1 in there or a coloured LED and using a sp10 bezel and reflector
what attatchment
but dremel makes more sense
ive been hand filing
its lot of effort
maybee
once i can figure out how to mount it in a drill
theyre getting sanded out
nah, sold a couple customised ts10 to sitrelenby and used the money to buy more ts10 because i really liked the finish
that section
thats what i meant by clip next
then polish
im gonna try a dimpled battery tube and smooth everything out
its a spare light so im more just fucking around than anything
Clip next
Smoothing out my ts10 brass with solder and sand paper
iirc the bezel has some thread locker but its easy to get past
the q8?
that explains a lot
as fandtassy and assumed it was a personal play on the word fantasy
ive always skimmed it
omg just read your name
love and appreciation?
you can always do a chargeback via your card holder
personally id go refund, and mod the current head with a new emitter
yeah kinda, except just doing it to the pcb the LED sits on
it def will. you can always start a dispute and get your money back if the seller isnt helpful
to reflow it i think cheule has some guides on youtube. but youll need a hot plate and solderpaste and flux. its doable but i wouldnt reccomend it for a beginner
you could attempt to reflow it, but id try secure a refund or new head via aliexpress first
but if its too bright to look at it sounds dead
sometimes a multi die emitter will have a die that needs a smidge more power to turn on
cool, its probably just dead
it doesnt turn on even at full brightness?
Triple 46950 when!
same haha
reply monday hopefully
emailed omten about th switches
sad
i couldnt find the forward clickys product page
<@140540414154375168> lend a fella a hand and help me figure out which of these is forward and reverse
omten.net/ps090-push-button-switch/pbs090h35-torch-light-switch.htm
omten.net/ps090-push-button-switch/pbs090n-torch-light-push-button-switch.htm
if it is custom i might look at DIY options
hopefuly its a odd form factor and not just a custom
ive emailed acebeam
haha thanks
Rider Rx switch removed, anyone know of a reverse clicky switch in this form factor
Cause laser
They can't right
Do green lasers come in non monochromatic colours
Would be cool to get a green laser and a beam expander
ezpz
just create a large cluster
arent they huge on anduril
damn
not even FFL
won a 3rd light from marcos giveaway
yooo
im getting real tempted
You could probably salvage some ar PC other screens
are you slightly lifting your finger, i can activate and deactivate the switch without fully un pressing it
or should i polish it
will handling it more help bring that down
my cuts10 has built a bit too much patina
smothered chrome's colection is probably close
wolfgirl def
gosh thats fun
haha fair
vid?
samee
ff for mobile, chrome on pc
huh what kinda reliability issues have you expeirienced on others
which do you use
yaaaahh removes a lot of issues with having lots of tabs open
and maybe a drill
and some glue too then
with a saw and file
it is
4 x P30b now outperforms 3x p45b doesn't it
Plus
Eh life goes on
I want
So üòç

54 gbp for a sbt90 light
ive realised while UV is neat and all theres very few opurtunities to use it around my area
possibly, gonna finish up the driver work. then post to reddit and try sell
hey sorry to butt into a conversation with a different topic, but how much would you charge for a l21a UV, its a boost driver with one of the 9090 yingfengs and a blue lighted switch
will i be able to find the current through a led with the vf
if i dont have a vf and current curve
whoopsie
yeah
ooh
9090
gonna go to the specced 2.5
i think its around 1.8 - 2 A
cool
nah boost
Imma work on getting the driver to output more current
Ah cool
Would you say they can be overdriven
I've got their 9090 UV in a l21a
itd probably kill them with too much current
wait actually
<@551463315919077391> whats the best 5050 UV around - thats what the xhp50 is right?
im getting a second
well
actually
haha i wish my ns59 had uv
ill add a lighted switch for a fee
how about a l21a with 12v boost shunt modded, same UV led that sakowuf uses and a zwb2 filter
strobes, rgb strobes and blacklight
i can throw a rave
and a ns59v2
a wk40
ive finally got a powerful uv thrower
why not LED?
cyberwerk?
Mb new driver
Does decreasing sense resistance decrease current too?
2.5
Should be much higher
My 12v boost driver with lower than stock sense resistance outputs only 0.7A
But
Unrelated
Also
Huh fsir
gotta figure out why my pinecil tip is looking charred
anyways
aw wat i thought it was throwier
Eh at that point I'd just get the ns14
1lumen giveaway üòé
hahaha doesnt everything nowadays
wait the sfq60 and all those LEDs are yin ding? i thought they were san'an
thanks luna
ah cool
oh okay so hows SFQ60.3 compare to SSQ55
i swear those are the circle die emmitters
thats the ns14r tho isnt it ü§£
ah id love a side switched ns59
whats different, ns14 vs ns14r
BUT THE ONE I WON IS WITH THE OTHER LED OPTION
ALREADY GOT ONE
RAAAHHH
WON A NS59V2
YOOOO
Yeah you were asking about using it on a ms18
Tho Simon now sells coloured glass lenses which is neat
Gel iirc
Yup üò≠
Pinecil, wk40, aluminium beams, spade connectors
Today's the one day in the whole week I won't be home and I have 4 deliveries
also got any more details on that HID business
<@551463315919077391> is that what youre using for a reflex reflector
hiya
gotta use it
ive got a 3mx3m sheet in my bedroom
nah itll be cold
im thinking polycarb just since its lighter
sorry one last question, glass or polycarb for a protective sheet in front of my lense
thanks for the ideas luna üëç
ah cool
e.g side view of my bulb
could you draw a side cutoff view of how youre gonna sandwhich the bulb reflector in metal
but i think i could make the needed parts out of brass sheets
im pretty bad at getting precise parta out of that
okay okay
you start with a plate of metal?
how do you fabricate your metal
i love 3d printing cause i get infinite do-overs
thats fair
depends how precise you are
or even use 2 rods or flat bar
could do a single 2020
thats just a first thought
idk
id buy two aluminium 2020 extrusions and mount them parallel, then use tnuts and screws to connect a 3d printed shell to the alum 2020s, then you glue the black plastic shell to the 3d print
space in that shell for screws?
hang on
okay
oh recoil?
i *think * its a maaaasssive reflector for a UHP bulb
also <@551463315919077391>  if i were you id use silicone adhesive and a 3d printed bracket to increase SA, not sure what your bulb looks like
thats gonna throw so much better than a lens
what is it
fucking hell didnt know you had that!!!
whats your reflector thing
how would you suggest mounting it
ah okay
yeah all the IR goes through the reflector tho so i gotta worry about 3d printed plastics behind it
could do a two part milled POM block that clamps the bulb in place
this stuffs tough
idk
but i think having it heatsinked will help with cooling
only other option i can think of is using a sheet metal fab, then using silicone and keeping the bulb thermally isolated
sad stuff
fair but my bulb has no mounting holes
not sure thermal epoxy will be strong enough ; rtv silicone conductive enough ; boron nitride flexible enough
havent picked yet
itll be boron nitride paste or thermal epoxy or rtv silicone
im just concerned, will the bulb expand enough when hot that i cant have it solidly glued inside a hole
and then when my printer is fixed i can print everything out
getting the frame designed
hey <@551463315919077391>  im making more progress on the project
i aint getting run over
only time im intentionally obnoxious is if im crossing a road and its dark, you know whatever im carrying will be turboed at my feet
ill diy it poorly
$449.95 USD
Cool
maybe ill just get one 100w and another 400w and have two ends of the spectra
is there a sweet spot?
do you know the sweet spot
huh okay
imma finish the uhp first
long day
kinda assumed nothing high power would fit
oh idk
dremel and epoxy
built into the reflector?
weeeeeeee
HID spotlight
introducing parralel project number FIVE yipeeeee
thats it
but ignoring that sorta issue
id just swap the socket to match
that sounds too easy
huh
thats it?
sooooo
what kinda electrical changes would you ned for a HID
send me a 500mm parabolic and ill test <@130101943639998464>
oh i see
lens right
which would go first?
what cheap spotlight would you reccomend
use a elliptical to collimate light first?
cd/$
ah fair, but surely theyre cheaper than a large parabolic for the performace you get
how come
worse throw than a short arc lamp
I really wanna build one
Where'd you spot it
Less internal reflection issues?
Ooh true
What else should I pickup
And two new form factors
Two new brands
So I've got a maeerxu df01 and a jaxman e1 on my list
Every other light is more realistically priced from the store
It must be a extension tube only
This can't be right
For the massive capacity
Oh I see
I was gonna get a ns14 but oos
Also what light would you recommend I get from there
What's it for
Why would I?
Hmm
I can't find the 3x21d sbt90 on taobao for any less than AliExpress tho
Ah alright
Yk
So it's cooler
But the jkk is more obscure
I'm between those two I think
Jkk76 sft40 or 3x21d sbt90
Idk if I can justify 70 quid
Ah I've decided to sleep on it
are tghe nightwatch drivers any good
lemme research more
okay i might get that
what about Jin Heng JKK76
fair, i cant find any info on that
and 18 gbp
true, but snf60
idk
the 2nd one is like the mt04, cost 41 gbp
still considering these two
whats your opinion
worth?
48gbp
oh nvm foud it
link?
cant see the other
z6 is a thrower
im not seeing it
starfish?
but its cool to see it has anduri;
i wouldnt buy just cause more than i can afford
xhp50 or sft40
looks like anduril
its only 18 gbp
fair
i think so
yeah
45mm head dia
https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=728495795204
sft40 or sfn60 in here
true, i guess 4ch buck ispretty sweet
no demand for a rgbw rotary ight
i think it just wasnt popular
you changed the yellow üò°
inac üòí
hahah i wont bother him
i perfered yellow
weird
damn colour change
slay
hm idk those are fairly vanilla LEDs, but i suppose a sft40 starfish would be nice
theres gotta be a gem on there
i really want something of taobao tho
womp womp
yeah im out, hold for off
PISS   W A L L
sfn55 3000k
ive got it for 70, worth?
fr?
i might get a JKK76 with snf55 3000k
3x21d it is
ah okay
ye
<@137363644932423680>
the jkk is 10 gbp less
JKK90S sbt90 or 3x21d sbt90
ooh whats the magic lishen model number, lr21700lh?
perfect thanks
whats it want from me üò≠
ah are you abroad rn
can you give me 10m
and youre flying out there soon so youll just ship to me via royal mail or w/e
oh right duh
are you usa or uk based
i wonder if its to a set distance
yeah im excited to see the way it focuses
i think the flashlight is a smaller version of the experiment with a few mirrors in a portable package
also wk40 otw
hey <@551463315919077391> ive got some progress for ya, found a makerspace that might make the metal parts for me. ive go the lens holder 3d printed in multiple parts and i have a pinecil on the way. when the pinecil arrives ill figure out power to the bulb. gonna directly solder my wires as i cant find the right spade
ive got 4 large projects running in parralel
NUH UHHH]
yeah, a ns59
somewhere sunnier than london
id love to try it in florida haha
yeah, just cant use it at night if i use it with the sun ü§£
it sounds so cool
i really really wanna try it at night with a high power flashlight
her mums great, lent me her sekonic twice
no pics yet
my friends mum found a cool old flashlight in her attic
why
milky or frosted or something else?
what version of dc fix should i get
Hopefully same ui as Thor 3 which rocks
I assume larger antman
I'd never heard of it before sorry
Gib
Oooooh
He leaves the UK Jan 6th
Then dont
Unless that's illegal
Buy to my address and my brother can carry them to the us on the plane
but brokey ü§£
yeah id love to put one into a c8
But it stays cool and has some nice high high cri throw and tint
It's no 3000k sft40
Exactly 35m
And it's just slightly lit up
Farthest tree is between 60 and 50m
Vs ts10 brass
Whoops
<@544931397048205312>
and imma try cut off the overpour
moar
Do you know how it affects the beam
Also reckon a dedome and remove phosphor around a xpg4 would make it look better
Maybe a full mf01x
I'm gonna do it
how would i glue in there
idk the mf01x has slots in the head inside the cooling fins
how di measure the slot sizes for trit vials
idk what else i have with space for trits
mf01x pink and ice blue?
ooh
thats so neat
woahhh
yeah its not too bad, im always terrible at estimating flashlight size
got a pic in hand
oooh i was looking at this
ooh i bet thatd help the xpg4
Someone on here helped me find another spot on the board for the input wires to go
The original pads had torn off
It's a 12v wall wart I took out of the casing
Nah 240v ac into the wrong spot
I think we guessed the input wire location wrong
I've sent some first revisions to jlcpcb for quotes btw
I finally got a couple hours to work on the searchlight
It was the 12v DC adapter that I was gonna use for cooling
Yeah I think I got the input wire locations wrong
Sooo
The module I built tho is working
Powered it on üíÄ
Actually I probably just find another wall wart
What do I do now for my 12v fan supply
Do you remember when I was building this part
It was blinding and the bang hurt my ears
Sparks flew so high they hit the ceiling
<@551463315919077391> I had a whoopsie
Passss
G U H
How much
So, no change in the current after adding the two in series in parallel
Shhj üòâ
Would face down be better?
I just rinse with alcohol
It's fineeee
It's for a UV
üò≠
Yeah
The soldering is gonna be rough
Guh
2in series, in parallel to the 20mohm
Eh I don't have any
But I need to measure current
Cause I don't want to instantly fry this emitter
What time frame would you consider a momentary current spike
I can drop to 14mohm as my next increment
Also <@410163261137223704> <@130101943639998464>  with the 20mohm it's only outputting 2A üò≠ maybe I'll add a parallel 47mohm
Working on getting some CNC metal parts, once I have those it should be super quick to finish, I'm gonna use boron nitride to glue in the  bulb to a metal bracket
ü´∂
brb
im pretty sure my ns59 is over 150W
dude thats so little power
yeah quartz lens
thats nothing
whattt
0.4 difference isnt **that **much
the LED is rated for 2.1
20
chances a 20mohm will kill it?
ugh
cool
ahh
oh are you in london
but 6 quid shipping üíÄ
eh mines more than a hour away by public transport
where do i buy that
i need to measure pd across the resistor
okay so to measure what im currently working on
yeah the driver speccs 2.5A and has a 20mohm resistor
what is the maths
hang on, before we assume my maths is right
this is a shame
i wish
my ohmeter doesnt go low enough üòê
so <@410163261137223704> are you saying if i put the 20hm back in there it might not get 2.5A
i suppose not to exact values but just higher or lower
I really thought people did this to their drivers more often to change the current
imma say fuck it and give the LED 2.5A
at this point
i gotta sliiightly drop the current
ive got 47mohm and a 20mohm resistor
i need help
ugh
And my math said I'd get 2.35
I was aiming for 2.1 to 2.2
It dropped my current from 2.5A to 1.83A
I went from 20mohm to 23.5 ohm (2x 47mohm in parallel
Hey do I increase or decrease sense resistance to increase current
can i run a gtfc40 on a normal 12v boost converter
And I'll use it to slowly ramp up in the morning and evening to mimic the sun
And a Arduino to signal to a boost driver to turn on or off
Use 2x gtfc40 at opposite ends of the cct spectrum
I think next thing I build will be a dual channel sunrise/sunset box
That's fair
Got it off tho
The sense resistor
Ah nvm
Also how do I desolder this fella
Meant CCT, what's wrong with warm light
What's wrong with low cri
Whatttt
Or gtfc40 1850k s21b
2700k DD
Someone must've moved it while we were drunk
It's was at a convention and i shared a house
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
I LEFT MY S21D 519A 3500K DD WITH THROWY OPTIC AND GLOW GASKET AT A AIR BNB
which is where here
Guh
Gotta redo them
So half my crimps fell apart
Surely whatever I solder to there would melt too then?
Okey dokey
Hope üò≠
üíÄ
Also <@551463315919077391> looking at some bulbs in housings, they use spade connectors, but mine aren't the right size, so I think the only option is to solder
Cool ty
Huh okay, I'll look more at guides
Otherwise I'll solder the connections I guess
The female plugs don't fit the bulb, but I can probably find a screw for those two
lemme check, while youre here, i bought a lighted switch for the AC wall wire, its got 3 prongs, 2 are switched the 3rd doesnt have continuity with the others no matter if its on or off
like a ground wire does to a case
on the bulb, the two legs appear to have holes, should i be screwing something into there to make connection
is it meant to be a screw down spade connector or alike?
what do i use on the bulb terminals
phew
üíÄ
22awg
oopsie, just checked it
16awg silicone wire good for every connection?
okay i think in my photo, left == negative
yes maam ü´°
surely the ballast input is polarised tho
<@551463315919077391> got most of the crimpin done, any clue what the polarity is of the DC input and the bulb
aw shizzle i fogort about polarity, <@551463315919077391> do you know the polarities for both plugs?
üòé
Cool
Or solder after snipping off the wings
After doing this
So I solder it
Cool
Rate the crimp
<@551463315919077391>
Idk üò∂
Doesn't that go against the manufacturer spec
Cool
Oh okay
The wings stick out pretty far
How?
the official one cost 500
but i dont understand the crimp standards
if it helps, its these
jst vh
hey <@551463315919077391> i realised i need a crimp tool for these
will do tmrw when the plugs arrive
ok
will it be safe to probe
320vdc
the rectifier
i want to probe everything with a multimeter before going straight for the ballast being plugged in, how can i do that safely
if it doesnt power on when i do plug it in do i just leave it for a sec
okay so start with the one nearest the camera and then test
awesome, should i short them via latching switch? is there a way to turn off the bulb without a full power down? or is the best solution just solder blob
depends which way you mount it i suppose
un-drawn pic in case ive got it qrong
<@551463315919077391> like this?
hang on lemme get the pics up
<@551463315919077391> would you help me decipher the optocoppler info sheet so i can try get the ballast working
And using the bare bulb
So would I be better off with a large parabolic reflector
Hey <@551463315919077391> I read that a uhp bulb throws better with a reflector than a lens for the same size
Closes k can get is two 0.047ohm in parralel
Cool
<@551463315919077391> could you help me
i gotta go from a r020 (20mohm) resistor giving 2.5A to ???? to get 2-2.2A
if i wanna do a sense resistor swap
id worry about arcing
For easier maintenance and cable routing
Hey <@551463315919077391> I want to add a plug between the bulb and power supply, preferably something that has a screw down retaining ring, know anything like that
im pretty sure this is it
yup
the optocopplers ive identified but i dont know what to do with the spec sheet
yeah the plugs 
Waiting for some plugs and crimps
And make the ballast turn on
All that I need to do is re print a part, tape over the bottom of the ballast to be extra careful and solder the fan to the 12v psu
<@551463315919077391> mockup of the final power supply enclosure
will slicing it allow for more current
but ill order the resistor now just in case
and decide
ill see it in person
oooh
yuh
how do i calculate the resistance i need for my new sense resistor, i have a convoy gt f40 friver and it outputs 2.5A but i need 2.1A max
all good then
yup
like have a breaker?? or
ill leave them on then yeah?
What're those electronics on the plug for
Mounting everything inside a old PSU
<@551463315919077391> found a way to mount everything and have cooling, this feels much safer
i wonder if this would be useful for making a massive and cheap reflex reflector
whats it all mean?
hey <@551463315919077391>
Are these the optocopplers (white rectangular things)
haha thats fair, just wondered if anything stood out to you
middle hole ill glue the bulb in and the 4 holes around it i can use standoffs to thermally separate it from whatever its screwed to
watcha think?
<@551463315919077391>
Yippee
Got a 4mm alum bracket on the way üòé
imma beg my friends with cnc's
the dremel keeps jumping around
ive given up doing this by hand
do you know if the body of the bulb gets hot?
thats a lot of metal üò≠
true
gotta find a way to widen the hole on this disk first
imma see what it costs to get something laser cut
true
but then i wouldnt be able to remove it
otherwise i could just epoxy it to the disk (after widening the hole)
maybe a second disk and itll be sandwiched between them
idk how ill actually mount it tho
then the bulb can rest on the glass lip
then trim it down to whatever size i need
ive got to make the 25mm hole into a 48mm hole
ive got 50 or so iirc
aluminium HDD disks
hang on ive got the perfect idea
translucent
the whole reflector is slightly clear
i might do some hand cut aluminium to mount it like you did
mine doesnt have mounting holes which is a shame
ü§£
none of mine have proper screw holes
fair, howd you mount it all
üíÄ
<@551463315919077391> does your rectifier thingy get really hot, does it need more than ambient cooling
Wonder if when it's in flood more of the heads surface touches the body and it dissipates heat better that way
Hey <@140540414154375168> does the head move on the zoomie or is it internal
Yeah that really is odd
Is some light bent too far under 80 percent and hits the bezel
Why?
Weird
Like max output is at 80%
Yeah fr massive change for such a small thing
Get a temp readout for the first 10m for each
I wonder if it's a heat thing
Same LED?
See if they get hot or not
Gotta make some adjustments
<@551463315919077391>
ill ask around
okay
hm
ill purchase
nop
oh yeah will i need to insulate the pins on the bulb and the ballast
2x single wagos
or wagos
and thata better than direct solder?
doesnt need to be un pluggable IG but idk whats smartest
so what should i do to connect the two
okay
gah damn
i thought it ran at 325v
holy hell
Hey <@551463315919077391> what's the chances a knock-off xt60 would survive between the bulb and the ballast
tongue üòà
or
screwdriver üò≠
for testing i will manually discharge tho
in normal use*
ill be waiting a while before touching it
yup
üòé
ive got a 1Mohm resistor in parralel
my other option was using polycarb and a hot wire to bend it o shape
haha ü§£  still working with tinkercad tho
gonna add holes to pass the wires from my 12v supply to parralel the 320v supply
i promise i wont
yeah they wont get jostled, im putting it inside a 3d printed enclosure
<@551463315919077391>
Is this stupid
so both lives would need to connect via one path no?
i was thinking of putting a rocker switch on the live line
<@551463315919077391>
i might also try wiring in a flood channel later on depending on how the build goes so + 100w or so for my 12v PSU
reckon a 5a fuse is okay for the 180W bulb + a couple fans?
ill just leave it
it doesnt matter
ac never mind
unless theres a reason to keep it?
its more of a nuisance than anything
surely i could just get rid of it
5.2 ohm
And because this will go in parallel to the other PSU I made, I just need to put the two lives on the same side
Okay cool üëç
Surely those two traces are for diff things
But
Ik polarity doesn't matter so much
Surely there's a difference
Really? Even between those two pads?
Can I just cut off this status LED, it's kinda annoying
The neutral goes to one large pad so it's fine to put the wires anywhere there
The one with the aluminium thingies or the one at the edge of the board
But the neutral mark isn't clear which trace it's for
That's where the live and neutral marks are
Lemme get a pic
One last thing
Cool
Would you circle the fuse on the photo
Those are fuses?
They're next to the aluminium thingys
<@410163261137223704> I see a live and neutral marking
I've only removed 2 wires
ü§∑
I think it's these two
<@551463315919077391> I forgot to mark where the wires for the AC input go, any chance you know?
16awg
Also, what's a ballpark figure of how long I can make the ballast --> lens wires
So I'll need to figure out something adjustable
So I can't set a exact focus distance
Idk where the light comes out of the bulb
The only thing I can't think of a solution for is fine tuning focus
Imma 3d print sample parts for everything and take it to the hardware store
And the bulb holder I might try get some pvc fitting
And then for the cone part I'll copy the build you linked with either wooden dowels or threaded rods
I've got a cad mockup done for the frame holder, it'll be wood with tnuts to screw down a retaining ring
I've got a working idea of the frame
Good news
<@551463315919077391>
What's buck especially good for?
Cool
Which sp10 has a buck driver
üëçüëç
Straight into the bin
I'll keep monitoring it
Maybe it's self discharged
I've no clue how it kept charging and didn't go over 4.15v
4.15v
The other batteries in this set only needed 1000mah
4500mah into a 18650 and it's physically warm üíÄüíÄüíÄ
I think my batteries are fuckdd
imma talk to a welder friend and see what they can do for me
no heatsink
imma use a back pack mount either way
doesnt matter i suppose
surely blowing would be best vs sucking air through
but i like the look of the build you linked using the psu
ill crack open my 12v wall wart and see what i can do
<@551463315919077391> just realised i have a dell optiplex PSU, i can tap its 320vdc and use its 12v output and save space possible
i can probably get some sort of rigid frame for it
should i worry about the lens twisting
i answered 20 of these before considering its all german phrases
go luna
wooooo!
nop
omg do you speak german, ive just realised the captcha is probably a german one
otherwise one of those wall warts
probably, heavy asf tho
gotta find a way to output 12v tho for my fan
im still pretty undecided on all this
yeah kinda
surely you want the reverse, heat it up and set 50c to equal 21
and 3d printed tpu clamps for the lense
so far a pvc pipe cuboid seems nice
and imma read up on the link you sent for frame ideas
and then to work on the ballast
tomorrow i finish school early so im hoping to get the eliptical focal length figured out
and what can be used to blind me
she likes whatever has a thick beam
my gf humours me and asks about them all the time, she gets the full tour every few weeks plus now i have a opple shell get the rundown on that
What should it look like
I don't think so?
I gotta figure out how to read the flicker graphs
Permanently sold out on Ali and the only places carrying it is either Amazon for 80 or some industrial sites for 30 and a moq of 10
The ra, r9, cct and flicker is okay tho?
And it's convenient
It's the best I can afford
Ah well
Also the ns59v2 üíÄüíÄ
Lmao if I use the X and y coord is that accurate?
<@544931397048205312> spill and hotspot (hot spot is positive duv) on a xp g4
Also, when on low mode, what should I want to see on the flicker detection
And how come the output on my s21d CC 8A has so much variation in output
Oh well
Something about sleep I think
Can someone explain the graph at the bottom and CS and EML
I can't find it via google
Got a link to their post?
Hm available to anyone?
Also, I love factory defects, idk what this lense is used for but it's really cool, imma make a positive duv 519a üòÇ
I'll DM them
Blf?
Are they on Reddit or discord?
Fair üòÇ
In the build you showed me, How'd they construct it
To hold the lens and bulb
Whopper lens
Now to figure out the frame, I wonder how those other people did it
Yup üòõ
Got a free pack of factory defects from the optic company, looks like a convex lens that filters out red light so it massively raises DUV
Rah üòé
He would've redelivered in 2 days
He said it needed to be signed for and since no one was home
He had my lens, ballast, bulb and opplr
Popped home from school to grab my gym stuff and saw the postie
üò≠
ill make something better over the weekend
its getting two or 3 refletions
the multiplier jumps around from 4 to 7.6
yeah  ik, i tried remeasuring a few lights
so somewhere around 7.5 ish
but measuring my thor 3 that isnt accurate
accounting for the brass ts10 multiplier 5.7 is more accurate
its the brass ts10
so my ts10 turbo according to that is 1990 lm
rough numbers say a multiplier of 8.09 will give me a accurate lumen number
It took 5 minutes üò≠
Integrating cuboid üòé
what by?
i still need to set up my luxmeter
no rush
i think we bought it on the same deal
same
yup
tipped it into the tube and soaked and still nada
acetone hasnt helped my brass ts10 open up
hm
ill just assume its the same as reviews and send it to ya next time im in the US
if only id known sooner, my dads a few hours away from you rn, left yesterday
a uhp even badasser-er
a w1 would look badass behind it
my 40cm fresnel is due any day
speaking of optics
is Vf a function of resistance?
itll be well regulated right
i dont think i have any other un modded boosted lights
also, reckon the rider ti v2 with a nimh cell would be a good reference light to calibrate a luxmeter
is that all it takes to de glue
Ohh gotcha so 259X="known value" ceiling bounce
Since the light would spread more across the room
Cool but surely you'd get a lower LM value if ceiling bouncing Vs a shoebox
Not even a ts10
Like cd and lm
How do I use it to get some useful numbers
Hey so I finally have a lux meter
so should be here soon
the ballast left china 2 days ago
then both
bridge the other and see result
so i identify which two are input, bridge one and see result
so i could make a toggle to change from high to low
and this part isnt high current right?
is there multiple of those or how would i not brindge all at once?
does the ballast let you vary the output
also
ahh cool
oh okay thats ezpz, howd you know to do that. also whats bridging those two do?
ye
ill write that down
ac
guh. the what????
it should be those numbers
ignoring the abberation my lens will add
but according to bulb specs
ahh
does that mean i shoulda talk about it until its actually working?
maybe 15
9k lumens iirc
but it should be nuetral and 100cri
but a projector UHP bulb, at the end of this month ill stick mine under a opple for ya
its not practical
for super good cri and lumens
yup 10440 keychain light, 400lm, 1 mode twisty
for a 58mm x2.5mm thick zwb2
cause its a lot cheaper than what im seeing on aliex
or black plastic holding the glass
is this one peice of glass
doesnt focus light
not curved
yeah its not really a lens
mb
tyy it didnt show up with keyword glass
im trying to get it all ordered at once
what size glass does the l21a use? i cant find anything on the convoy store for it
ü´∂
ty luna
i forgot to check ebay üíÄ
i wonder where he got the zwb2 from
üòé
yup
throwier
true, but ive swapped my sights to the l21a
but idk how the throw comparison is
theres a uv filter availble for the m21a
for my UV light im now down to l21a vs m21a
when the LED is big enough to make a c8 look floody üíÄ
ü§£
wheres the hotspot in that pic?
now to find zwb2 filters
i settled on the L21A as host fr my UV torch
faster heat up?
i cant find
where do they sell the chisel tips?
cause my crap iron dont last at all
the tips last long enough?
cool
should i get pinecil or ts100. like the pinecil tips are expensive but the ts100 is worse than the pnecil right?
They all come stock with gtfc40
Yeah that was me <@410163261137223704>, I should've phrased my question better, I meant more which of the m26c, m3c, s21e have the largest reflector
I can't find much on the m3c
How's the s21e compare to the m3c in terms of throw
They tell you who picked up your parcel
Take a peek at parcels.com
amazon.co.uk/LiCB-23A-Alkaline-Battery-5PCS/dp/B07V26VLQ1
My friend is suggesting these to power the kc1 and to use in a battlebot competition we're entering over using p45b

Smh
anyone know where i could compare m3c and m26c throw?
im leaning m26c cause a simple clicky ui is nice for UV but the 26800 and charging on m3c is even nicer
for a UV powerhouse
m3c or m26c
I want my brass ts10 to turn on at the same brightness it turned off at
5h on anduril 1 for mode mem right?
UV LED secured üòé
i sanded the brass before hand
but the texture felt porous and dirty but it was remarkably tough, i tried scraping it with keys and it didnt come off at all
yeah the one on the right was a mix of crushed salt and vinegar painted onto the light then held above the ammonia and heated to 40c for 8 hours
the texture on the right suuucked
ah well
hm pretty much 5050
I need y'all's opinions and feedback
Straight out of ammonia chamber Vs after carrying+ wire wheel
There's some really cheap LEDs in all sorts of wavelength
But the price per LED is nice
Both are crazy
Same as alibaba
Ikr
I'm getting one off sakowuf flowed to a board tho and picking it up from the USA
Yup
Kinda, you can buy from Alibaba but you have to buy 5 or something, otherwise yingfengirled has them
Same as my build!
got that "jonah and the whale" patina fr fr
then clear coat
im gonna carry mine raw for a bit to help wear down the raised edges
yeah most lights get a clear coat
also, reckon the white deposits are trapped salt
if it doesnt wear down nicely im hammering it and using brass black
imma try carry it for a day and see how it wears
Does brass shipwreck different to copper, this looks much worse than my copper test peice
and i left it on top of the radiator
i forgot my light was in the container cause my partner came over
how shipwrecked is too shipwrecked
are lux and lumens the same measurement but diff scales, e.g meter to feet
Do I need distance measurements
Awesome I have a dark room with white walls
If I want to compare my light before and after modding how would I do that (the before numbers were measured by 1lumen)
Lux =/= lumen right?
‚ù§Ô∏è
I've finally got the money to buy
<@544931397048205312>  hey what's the luxmeter you recommend, the Bluetooth one
i think youve replied to the wrong msg, unless UVC now has nice bins at 90cri]
ü´∂
uvc
ooh
fingers crossed
tonight imma go through and drop 175 for both lights üò≠
well, osram pvip, but yeah!
room to watercool
A 9090 uv LED in  M3C and a how power UHP searchlight
Whichever I don't do I'll do to the polished (or hammered) brass
Idk if I want to brass black this or shipwreck it
Solid copper patina developing
That PCB module has 3 components, the capacitor, a tall one that's the rectifier but idk what that short one is
Cool
Oh okay, so it's a little cheaper
Yeah I'd rather keep the pcb, I suppose I could print a jig to hold everything and then use wires instead of traces tho, how much do those rectifiers cost on RS, I'm already getting the cap and resistor there
or is there another item i can get from RS that would replace the ebay module
to get my 300+ vdc
and thats it right
uk.rs-online.com/web/p/through-hole-resistors/0131924
uk.rs-online.com/web/p/aluminium-capacitors/8714057

thats rated for 5W
so 1 mega ohm resistor
surely they like cancel out?
how do i put that resistor across the capacitor
i dont even know what i meant
but the resistor wont change the circuits function]
oh okay, so the resistor will slowly drain across the resistor
wdym, sorry im pretty new to all this
so how do they sell it like that
or does the capacitor limit the voltage
sorry if im being a bit dense, but if the component puts out 300+ volts how can they have a 25v capacitor installed right now
idk luna just told me itll do that
hey <@551463315919077391> 
im basing it off the fresnel lens uh
she had 3 lights to show me, one was a IFV (idk which) the other is a parabolic reflector UHP with 1mcd and the other she doesnt own is a fresnel lens UHP
with a 150w bulb and 300mm fresnel
the other light luna showed me has 450Mcd iirc
except
heh
then use either a lipo + inverter or a very long wall plug for power
yup, my plan is to put the electronics inside a backpack and then keep the main light lightweight
a long range search light, itll have a 400mm fresnel lens in front of it
yeah, im just not sure what direction i want the fan behind the bulb blowing
no glass coverings
its a glass fiber PP (i think) base connected to a aluminium elliptical reflector
also the other build ill be referencing doesnt use any heatsinking, nor do most projectors as far as i can see
glass?
ill have a fan directly behind the bulb to cool it as well as a air pump to blow air across the inside of the reflector to try keep it cool
hey <@551463315919077391>
Nighty, I'll pick up on this tmrw
Lemme look inside my spare meanwell PSU, might have a 400v cap with higher uf
Tomorrow I'll speak to my teacher see if school will support me and then order everything
Thank you so much
Oh okay
Or would that be dangerous
I can nab it's capacitor
Actually, I think there's a old fridge around the corner
So if ripple is a worry, what about putting them in parallel would that increase their total capacity
Awesome that's a little more stomach able
dammmnn
im pretty clueless at caps
oh fr, what kinda specs do i want
ah i have some of those
those look pretty dinky for electronics that will be strapped on my back next to my spine
like what if someone yanks the cable or it gets bent
is it as safe tho?
but instead of screw terminals ill solder everything
and maybe pot myself
otherwise ill get what you said
maybe she can hook me up
cool, lemme talk to my teacher tmrw, shes a electrical engineer
for my 5kw array coming soon ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
okay
id be more comfortable with a potted module
would this be okay
just to check
awesome]
huh okay
but no
thatd be dope
wait really
or it doesnt matter and it depends what my wall outputs
when i search for it do i need to specify the utput voltage
thats only 4A tho no?
then i die
for a split second my fingers and the rectifier will make a very intense arc
gone
dead
i will die
is more phases better?
2 in parralel
so i want a 200w 325v full bridge rectifier
ELECTROBOOM CARRYING ME FR
then ill buy a 400mm üòé
thats a full bridge rectifier right
and that makes 320v dc
do you know their lens diameter
just the bulb is ded
i suppose i could buy any old "for parts/not working" projector and assume the psu works
how jank?
and that will take 240vac
so i buy those two items and then i need a ~320vdc psu
awesome thank you
did you use glue? a heatsink?
for mounting, did you retain the full housing/cage
yes mam
fair ü§£
do you think its really genuine not a knockoff?
ooh true, someone must partner with them
ü´°
yeah itll just mean a lot of searching, first a projector, then one thats osram, then if its P or E
looks like if i shop for osram bulbs i can make sure its eliptical or parabolic
sram: There will be a sticker on the reflector or text on the read of the ceramic. You are looking
or the "PVIP" data. It will say P-VIP xxx(x= wattage) then the arc gap(l.o or 0.9 or 0.8) which is the
pacing in millimeters inside the arc-tube. Then the reflector size which will be a P (for parabolic)
r E( for elliptical) and a number.
üòÖ  just tell me if they become a bit much
sorry to keep asking you so many questions
oh gotcha
unless i can find out which are elliptical
that means buying full projectors oly then really
dang
even though both would be UHP bulbs
will it just be less efficient/flicker or will it break/not light up
can i buy a individual bulb and test it with the same electronics from this projector even if the gap length is difference
say i get this and its parabolic
quick q
ah yeah ill figure that out
hey <@551463315919077391>  
Awesome
Oh that's cool
What kinda power would you need to start hitting a limit of 20m or so
I'll stick solder a couple extension cords together
Not much limit
Oh sick
Do you know how far a normal 240v ac cable can go
AC I'll stick it in a backpack
True, that just means carrying a large box of dangerous electronics
But that's dangerous
So where can I have lengthy wires, between PSU and ballast
Guh why is electronics so tough
True but the final projects electronics will be far away inside a wood box and the actual light part will be on a longer cable so I can move a little with it
So it's 240VAC from the wall ---> that module -->325vdc out---> into ballast?
No worries then
Ohhh my bad that's inside the projector duh
But safe?
12v 200W PSU --> 300VAC car inverter ---> ballast
So tldr
I'm not too interested in getting it to run off a battery pack
My light will be wall powered only really
So I can buy a working bulb and then the corresponding projector from eBay as for parts
Usually when a projector is sold as broken it's the bulb right
Maybe I'd be better finding a full projector
Thats something I can buy online right? Cause those voltages are scary asf and I don't wanna get near them
Ohh okay thank you
<@551463315919077391> sorry to keep bothering you about this, but do you know? I've found a couple bulbs to buy
also a "projector ballast" is just a suitably specced normal ballast right
if i want to run via AC i just need a step up transformer
is the 300V inverter so you can run it off dc
funky
i dont think low cri 519a exists does it?
right?????
boiling eggs at 1 am for my brass torch isnt weird right??
guys
is that normal
they still fit tho
the others are a tad too small
and only one fits really well
ive got 3 ts10 clips
hm
Also I reckon a hammered brass ts10 with some brass black would look sick
So I accepted that I need sweat to patina copper

So I have begun the armpit-tina
Yk what tmrw I'm doing cardio so that I can sweat on the torch
And it's 4 degrees out
I don't sweat üò≠
Nose grease, plus giving my torch to everyone to rub , plus copper, plus frequent handling
And I still have no patina
Somehow
Also
I thought my 6 convoys were extensive
Otherwise no change
There's only a couple discolorations
I must be doing it wrong
shit STINKSS
Also I'm using vinegar vapor for a patina
Am I doing this wrong??
WTF HOW DO ANY OF YOU HAVE MORE THAN 10 OF ONE BRAND
now to figure out what to patina my copper with
Did some more polishing, before Vs after cleaning
I kinda like the pre cleaning look, maybe I'll pick up some brass black
ill keep my eyes open for a lm3 then
hm
oh
sounds fair
but the lm4 has flicker detection
so lm3 is more accurate but ill need to do some work for DUV
ouh
is very warm below 2000k?
reckon i should go 3 over 4
is lm4 that bad??
do i wait??
but i see in the blf thread a new product called SDL
or generally any opple
i really want a lm4
hmmm
we should implement a security circuit that detects the bezel, tailcap or driver from being tampered with and istantly destroys the driver mcu or shorts the battery
instead of being a pain in the ass to to open
lmao i hate the glued shut torches
LEP flashlight section ü§£
guh
go onnn
or just initate a chargeback
mybe try a video?
theyre just insisting youre wrong and its a 12 group driver
free torch then if you contact simon (if you arent cool with just swapping a driver)
üò≠
and all it did was leave a deap scratch
ive heated it to ~60c and then used pliers and leather to try take it off by rotating CCW
how tf do you get a CU ts10 tailcap off
G I B
Ooh 3000k sft40
Do you happen to want a sft40 fw1a
You're very convincing
üòÇ id have to buy a sft40 anyways, is that mod really that profitable
Sc31 pro
Better than pisstina üòÇ
Id be interested in that tho
Eh I'm not keen on EDC ing a 519a, not enough light and I don't mind medium cri for edc
Out of interest <@551463315919077391> what would you have recommended
My friends don't get the dedication üò≠
Also I heard that copper patinas with skin oils but my hands are dry as hell so I've been rubbing the cu ts10 on my nose every now and then
Fair fair, but I'd rather fried egg over lime sst40 üòÇ
If the ts10 clip was like the sc31 pro clip I'd be swapping
Honestly I love my sc31 pro it's the perfect edc, I kinda wanna buy another to put a w2 into and a 3v xhp50
Huh
Ty for the heads up ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Then the 9 die Korea UV led
And a random yellow led I found on silver ingot
Next on my list is the direct die green, amber w1
Yup as long as you can smooth out the artifacts it's a nice beam
I broke my sst40 and its my first emitter swap
Snake told me to ‚ò∫Ô∏è
how bad is the lm4 cause id buy one rn
i dont have many rosy LEDs tho
less rosy than a 3500k dd 519a, rosier than a Cu ts10 3000k, rosier than a culpm,
no opple
it stays cooler for longer which is solid tho and handles whatever the stock sc31 pro's turbo is
but its dimmer
and its def pretty intense and throws better than the sst40
its solidly rosy which is nice
its still not centered so the beams gonna be ugly, but i can tell theres def some light cree-rainbow going on. the LED looks sweet under a pebbled tir tho and i bet dc fix would be sweet, if i got a OP reflector itd probably sort it out
ah cool
did you see my msg a couple days ago?
hm, 1lumen says 3A tuebo
yeah
maybe xml2, cri isnt that big a deal
they want white light tho
im tempted to just put my spare xpg4 in there
my friends bugging me about a LED replacement for their sc18, targeting 4000k 
i dont know what would be best
519a is safe for 3A right
*glass
a hybrid mule uses a [usually] white opaque plastic reflector shape around the LED to help redirect some light while keeping the crisp mule look
just bare LED
a mule is just any light without any reflector, TIR, lens etc
pretty much, light bounces off the inside of the plastic walls because physics
it relies on how light bounces within a medium
that TIR stands for Total Internal Reflection
ah gotcha, you took out the TIR, the big clear plastic cone thingy
i assume theyve stumbled into their first mule
ik ik, but thats just added info for <@558837879023861761>
de doming would make it throwier
do you mean you removed the TIR?
ah well
uk?
some elbow grease and a little damp rag is all üòâ
Guh
But my cuts10 doesn't smell at all
My copper stock smells
True
Some vinegar and salt will clean it ez pz
Imma guess it's not threading all the way so tmrw I'll keep playing with the threads and try clean them up manually
Idk what else would be a problem
So not that
Already cleaned the copper head with ipa
Yeah except the brass head (stock) works with the hammered copper bod, so it's a issue with the copper head
ughh got the cu ts10 un screwed but now its only factory resetting and wont turn on
never mind my dad got it unstuck
nah at the head
i tried using two pliers and leather to grip it and dipping the head in boiling water and the body in ice water
i think the cu ts10 is lost üò≠
maybe cool the head and heat the body and try unscrew it
i dont know what to do üò≠
uh oh, i tried hammering my copper ts10 and forgot to unthread it every now and then during hammering and its stuck shut, ive tried putting it in the freezer and using leather and two pliers but it wont budge
hammered brass
im thinking maybe force patina copper
i have both
i cant pick
should i make a hammerred brass or copper ts10
I'll do that when I get a hot plate, new iron and my opple üòé
Oh smarttt
I've got one spare xp g4, maybe I'll stick it in a ts10 or something idk
Thank yoy
Oh awesome!!
7mm
Is the lm4 really that bad
I can't find a lm3 available in the UK
It's fully off and unscrewed from the body
Also the die glows in the dark or something
I'll def have to buy a opple and BT lux meter
Assuming the thermal paste is making good contact this thing doesn't get warm that fast on turbo
Its throweier, better tint, slightly dimmer, less hot
Compared to the sst40 in here before
Imma close up for the night and then disassemble to measure
Gimme 5m
I just assembled it
Imma get some more beamshots
Are ya proud
I did it!
<@544931397048205312>
Also, very little tint shift across low to high
But how do I centre the board
Sc31 pro reflector
Xp g4
Like a custom one?
Although there is some noticeable tint shift across the beam
But it's quite rosy, very nice tint, very throwy
I need to figure out how to properly center both the board and the reflector
Tape wouldn't fit so I used some nail polish over the contacts
Reflector installed üòéüòé
RAAAH
DONT WORRY IM A GENIUS
and since the Aliex store doesnt carry xpg4 i may aswell figure out reflow
i gotta find a quick way to get a xpg4 onto a 20mm pcb without waiting for KD
do all xp g2/3/4 LEDs have the same footprint
im thinking, solder a short solid copper wire thats hammered flat sideways to keep all the wires away from the reflector
also anyone have an idea how i can make space for the reflector
its the l70 right?
haha cause its round
the  white LED  part might reflect enough light to show up on the projected image
idk what to do
the reflector doesnt even sit low enough down
What do I do
Guh üò≠
If I put it in it will
Why?
To my eye it's pretty even, slight green at the very edge, overall kinda rosy
But
And I don't have a centering ring
My reflector don't fit
<@544931397048205312>
Ughh
What Luna said
Ughhh
The driver looks like it's soldered in
And replace them
Imma have to take out the driver
I burnt those wires üíÄ
It's now only got high mod
Tried adding thermal paste to my pink s2
Uh oh
How tough do yall think it's be to swap a rider rx to a reverse clicky
The 1616 is the better one right
,yeah think so
I've never had any issues
Huh funky, mine works fine
But idk what driver or emitters I'd even put in there
I'd love to mod them
These are pretty sick
a.aliexpress.com/_mOoNNvm


It weighs so little
Just interesting it spins so long
Do you what kind of mechanism is in there
Flashlight_deals
It's really active
Nah I get a tonne of deals through thete
Buy a lume1 driver or similar high end driver
I'd buy a knockoff and have it stonewashed
Idk
Idk what the custom markets like, or if my light qualifies as a quality light worth buying
But I wanna get an idea of market value
I won't hold you to any price
Just ballpark
You name the price?
Really? üòÇ
Do you think someone would buy
Could I sell the ts10 ti
I wonder
But I can do it fully assembled
Nah just need the ti part
Idkk
Maybe
I really shouldn't
Or maybe a gradient
And do something similar
Should I get the rider Rx ti
what about injecting thermal paste underneath
ah gotcha
why wouldnt it?
how come?
yup
only thing i can think of is soldering it all now and then using a syringe to inject it under
but if not i dont have a transformer
im psure its ac
mines a really cheap one
iim at home rn, leaving for the USA, i wont be able to bring my soldering equipment since the iron wont work on 120v
cant bring my soldering equipment with
10 days til im back
really?
the dream is dead
yeah im down to 1 hour
Any substitute?
I leave for the USA in 3 hours
<@544931397048205312> üò≠üò≠üò≠ my friend forgot the thermal paste
can i add 1 extra in parralel
do 7135s need to be symetric
but if imma do a triple xpg4 i want deeper reflectors
it probs good for a triple
its super shallow
ah no i meant reflector
Damn
Huh I forgot how shallow the sc31 is compared to the s2
I can do a coloured filament but I don't have any translucent others
shipping will probably be more expensive to include the large diffuser
thats one filament
theres just one
the diffuser?
but its not that bad
it does get pretty toasty
nahhh i like my cc
down to one
i had two originally]
yep
is 7 pounds okay?
ehh i prefer the s21d personally
yk what if its nice ill try get some in a s21d
ooohh
would they all fit?
i only have 2 rn tho
fc11 style
sc31 is single
in a sp36 maybe
ive got to wait til tmrw to get my thermal paste then ill sort out the xpg4
this is just a tube i got to get to the min shipping
haha the g4 is going in the sc31 pro
18350 S2+ is sick tho
Hm
No thermal paste tho
It's all good snake
It was the 7135 on tape I saw
Thank god
ü•¥
I might have forgot to get that hot plate
I'm starting to realize tho
It just arrived in the mail
<@544931397048205312> get ready for some 4000k xp g4 goodness
white, glow green
GITD?
And already has a girlfriend
Man is a minor
üíÄ
I'll print it and include it with your ts10, just make sure it's the right tolerances and all that. Want any diffusers too while I'm at it?
Send the file asap
Omg <@140540414154375168>
ill get uit before school üòé
40m print
TOLERANCE?? I HARDLY KNOW 'ER
RAAAHHH
DESIGNED WITH TINKERCAD
AA DIRECT DRIVE 3D PRITNED
imma bout to make the crappiest flashlight youve seen
yeah
but also i forgot im using AA so 3v üíÄ
but what luna said
oopsie
mans in a rush
my led will get 6v right?
May as well huck a ACC green led in then üòÇ
I'd still have to buy a green led to get that green phosphor üò≠
If I find a green LED I could make a RGB wko4
It requires rechargeables and has 0 protection
What a useless host
Odd the light really won't work on AA or nimh
and when i dropped the phosphor back on it went white which is neat
it looks sick
dedomed the wk04
also
ill probably give it to a friend, theyre a massive cheapskate in dire need
lmao
it was running fine when i got the package üòä
no power when running aa
I'll get a pick in a sec if u need
It was inside a super simple red host
Any idea what voltage this led is
So wurkkos sent me a 2nd extra free light with a super discharged 14500. The light was on inside the package üíÄ. I don't know why they sent it because afaik (I haven't opened the sealed cu ts10 bags) already have batteries
method?
thats cool
oooohh
üò≥
Sometimes I use it to find spots on my face
On the inside
My eyes itch
Yea
Might be simple mode batt check
Does 3c blink some stuff
Or maybe a smooth transition between each step on stepped ramp
I wasn't sure, but maybe at the bottom ramp they're improving the smoothness of the ramping
Or do you guys mean something other than smooth Vs stepped ramp
That sitrel has been talking about?
my tits shipped on smooth ramp
3c on
ill compare reflectors
ooohh
hosts expensive tho
teeny weeny or mega throw
im 50/50 on l21b or GTA
i reckon that w1 green would be sick in a lmtop gta
really new to the whole diy with LED stuff
sorry for all the questions
ah gotcha
and i thought cslnm was a osram thing
thats pretty low lm
one sec
ohh
ahh ty
ty for the heads up
also, any way to non destructively test if something is stainless steel or titanium
stick em  in a l21b
imma probably get those as my first green and first amber
awesome
are the amber and green cslnm1 any good?
ooh found a amber cslnm, i kinda wanna swap it or a green cslnm into the lumintop GTA
ELPLP42 SPECIFICALLY
hey <@551463315919077391> hows a UHE bulb vs UHP
mine arrives soonish iirc, i cant wait to try it out
thats a shame, what tint and bin did you get?
id have a genuine beacon visible for miles
a massive array of lenses and all those bulbs üòã
imagine what i could do with all these
oooh
you just said that
long day
oh ffs
ooh onto a d4?
ohhh gotcha, do you have one in hand?
why xp-g2 over the xp-g4, the g4 is more efficient and has a narrower beam?
bosh
other low
one way high
use ohm meter
I really want a white mix and pink
Yup
They look so yellow and green
And after turning off the pink, the DD 519a look green and ugly to my eye üò≠
Omg did a mix of 3500k DD 519a and the new pink
¬£3 + shipping?
What's the difference between p and not p
ü´∂
PINK BRASS TS10
copper 16mm pcb
want one of mine
i can never remember, are you UK?
theyre normal 3v LEDs, just gotta set a suitable max current
oh yeah totally
uhp?
and somehow brighter than the white xml2 i already had
theyre pink xml2
<@140540414154375168>  i totally get why you love them
and theyre sick!!
in fun news at least, my pink LEDs arrived
yeah ill keep looking
i emailed asking about 4 days ao
no clue but i got the email back from them today at 8am ü§∑
sad times
<@551463315919077391>  my school said no üò≠
Euh
Oh right
Would the sfn43 3x21d be better
But neat beam
Ahh fair
Why not?
I really want a l21b cslnm now
I always forget how crazy it is
The beam is just nutty
The lumintop gta is so throwy
Gah damn
like a bullet?
yup
the roof looks neat tho
ü§ì
i hit top speed instantly
tldr got a face full of brasso
in my infinite wisdom i thought i could bring the brass ts10 up to a mirror  finish using my dremel and a polishing wheel dipped in brasso.
awww
tf am i buying anywhere else, 10m walk to get my batteries!!
I MISSED IT AGAIN
But that's  probably my fauly
The only issue is the aux thing with lockout
The mf01x works perfectly
Yup üòé
that looks so silly
omggg
i guess ill just have to swap the LEDs in the titanium
the brass ts10 is pretty nice tho
darn
no sadly
Does the tits10 4000k use different CSP to the old 4000k, cause mine look pretty green
'ate the foreigners, love me tories. simple as
top quality government
wanna hop to dm's
awesome!
i  meant the cost of the torch üòÖ
awesome, and youre okay with that price?
ah i can do regular us post from florida then
anywhere near chatanuga?
ah i dont think im passing through much of the south
oh what state
and if youre in florida i can have it shipped from there
ill be in the us pretty soon, so if you can wait a couple weeks then whatever normal us shipping costs
oooh i wonder how it would look on TI
thats the only reason im considering selling a few
haha me neither
just out of interest, ive got no clue what this kinda thing would go for
what would be a fair price to you?
idk if thats a fair price, bu time + material came outto that
you asked about the price
<@558837879023861761>
clip and diffuser and battery included
¬£49.50
hang on
fair question
uhhh
does that really count as a custom, cause otherwise theyd just buy straight from wirkkos
the polished/hammered ts10
im kinda thinking of selling it, do you think anyone would buy it from the BST
ty ü´∂
theyd just mix to white amyways
oh yeah duh
itd be so trippy
ooh 3 monochromatic LEDs
omg do cyan, pink, lime next!!
Finished polishing the ts10 finally
soooo
an acid etch would def help, but those chemicals terrify me
im not sure why, but the head specifically, not the bezel, refused to fully colour
and the finish definitely isnt even across the whole light
wanted a unique look so im electro anodising mu ts10, i definetly have a few changes id like to make if i do this again, the finish im doing is only half done but i got my colours the wrong way around
i got mine really hot wih a hairdryer and just used my hands to pop it open
huh mines pretty pink?
wait is there a difference between new gen xpg2 and xpg4??
you got the xp-g4?
"nuh uh that's 200m away bruh"
Yup üòÇ
You're the only result when I searched "r/flashlight UHP bulb"
Hey <@551463315919077391> are you myvesdin on Reddit?
i dont need aux anyways
im not to bothered tho
yeah funky right
Yup
but in advance UI it doesnt do anything
so in lockout 7c works to change brightness
hey <@140540414154375168>  is that something with your build or is it because i shorted it and fucked shit up
7c and 7h make 0 difference
suuuper dim in normal
really bright in lockout
my fucked aux
wtf
üò≠
but oh well
they have flat ends üò≠
torx
no torches in school since it could start a fire
my TI pen would too
not with that attitude in the UK it isnt
weapon
lil bro got suspended for taking a computer mouse home
no way i get away with this
i got sent home for having a stubby screwdriver on me
theyre solidly screwed to the wall
like theft "borrow"
time to poke around my school to find out who replaced our projectors and then beg they give me a old one
on my way ü´°
address.
ill buy something for the focusing part, but these are what my school has. TIME TO BEG üòé
ahh, the dry ass uk air dont help me
these mega throwers are so new to me
oh true
is that 2mcd? cause my lep is around that and not as visible at all
theres no need, i just wanna make a beacon and fuck with my friends
oh cool ill just hook it up to a 12v car batt
cool, how old is a "old projector"
whats powering your 300V inverter?
so include a fan to circulate air and buy new
the tastiest
thats safe
pshhhh
HERE I COME (full face shield included)
how fragile is fragile
with all the electronics too?
i wonder how the UHP compares. im sure the sbt90 is more portable considering it needs less electrobnics and batteries to power but it wouldnt be as bright/intense
cool
oh okay
<@551463315919077391> how much did that UHP setup cost you?
surely if i take a lens and focus it to a tiny spot and havw that at the big fresnel's focus point id get something super tight
oh okay so ill invest in something a little larger and maybe a sfy55 or UHP
sooo luna wya
oh idk i figured a LEP was best
its in the listing
the focus?
this'll probably take a couple months to get going
3d printing and the lep module is threaded so hopefully it wont be too painful if everything goes to plan
CHROMATIC ABBERATION TO THE MAX
WELL THEN I HAVE SOME PLANNING TO DO üòé
but maybe i just cant hit the perfect focus
yeah they have a lot of divergence vs a LEP
more lumen less throw?
so how do they focus to infinity?
you wouldnt happen to know lots about lenses in LEPs would ya
luv u luna ü´∂
oh it doesnt show my swiping left first
üíÄ
hey im looking for a good host to butcher for a LEP project: a whats a good host to start with that has at least 2s 18650 or 21700; what anuril driver can do buck down to 4v from 2x4.2v
read your message after school
thats how i knew it dropped üò≠
It seems either my kaidomain or more likely TiTS10 is shipping with "ueeshop" which is really damn slow
Just my luck
Damn missed the sft40 again!!
That should give a solid idea of how rosy it is
And l21b culpm
And sfq43
And to some xhp50
I'll compare it with some DD 3500k 519a in a s21d
I got 4000k 90 cri
It's supposedly rosy
<@544931397048205312>  as soon as my xpg g4 arrives ill send beamshots
RAH
and a xpg g4 sc31 pro
imma make a pink and part brass s2+
just ordered xpg g4, pink xml2 knockoff, brass 18350 tube and some 7135 regulators
üòé
old server supply
hp platinum
i found it in a dump üôÇ
dd from a power supply?
would that work
direct drive?
some masssssive heatsink and a fan and some thiiiccc wires
i wonder if i could direct drive a san'an LED from the PSU
for some non portable lighting
whats the dumbest LED i could stick in it
i found a 12v 41A psu
looks so fancy
ooh whats that
heh youre just getting someone else to do your workl
hahaha snake you really pushing that huh
What's a solid thermal grease for the mcpcb and driver
But I can Huck in a xpe
Cant to xhp
Ah so it's okay
Wait xpe needs 6v?
I was thinking xpe pink or cyan
It'd really underdrive a xhp70
I gotta check when I'm home
7135x something
For the xml2 or XML LED
One of the old 3/5 modes
It's a cheapo driver
Oh man I just realised I can mod my S2, big brain moment. Pink, cyan or piss green LED?
Damn I shoulda got 6000k not 4000k in the ts10
its rotary üòç
i kinda want it
ill just diy the loom
ive gt hundreds of dupont connectors
wheres it come into play in flashligh?
wire block to me meant a terminal block
OH
got a pic?
maybe im looking at a different block to what you are
0 way i can solder instead of using a splitter block, im on a tight-ish budget
tldr: this amazon.co.uk/Leeadwaey-Programmer-Testing-SOIC8-Clamp/dp/B0BJTBFQJP           and i have plenty dupont connectors already and ill just do some janky soldering for any adapters <@544931397048205312>
sorry i had to go for a hour
like the wago blocks?
any reccomended
i should get one with usb right?
nah ill buy soon
The small one has continuity to the led negative too
Also the big ones are to the mcu
Ah I can check to the wire tho
Ground
And the lil ones got continuity to the driver negative
There's continuity
How would I solder vertically like that?
Huh
Oh
Which pins are those
It blips
Definitely does, it's visible in the ramp
So I see 2x FETs presumably, 1x USBC chip, 1x tiny 85. What controls the LEDs when dimmed
Might be, there's a bit of a alpha/@ looking logo on them
32100 bv016
Although ones charred
2x springs ye
Also reckon there's room on the driver for a second fet
I've done the driver side
Do I bother doing all 3 batt springs too
Double bypass on one spring
Inside üòéüòé
Fuck it
Or does it need to be inside
Go outside the spring
Also can a spring bypass
Cool
But it is anduril 1
I've never done a version check
Oops
90% sure
I think
It has flashing pads
For flashing?
There's two chips reading "32100 bv016"
It's a tiny 85
Do you need to read it
Idk whats what so lmk if there's something missing in the photo
And it was the mcpcb wires in the wat
Its just one board
Hey <@551463315919077391> you were totally right
I'm definitely making it a pink blaster
Plus the aux are stupid bright
I'm liking the raw alum and the tint on the xpl2 isn't too shabby
It's actually really nice
Got my rot 66 in hand
we can share üíû
hah yeah, i almost missed it too üòù
rot66
i bought one today
or that would be in parralel there wouldnt it
is that how i do it?
if i get a ammeter and hit turbo and measure current over a single led
i gotta re-flash the torch to anduril2 anyways
then ill do just all pink
oh would a fixed mix not look good
im not set on that so if anyone has a really good mix the split would be 3 leds in the inner, 9 in the outer
pink outer ring
im thinking lime green inner ring
got a fireflies rot66 i wanna swap to 2 colours of LED
is the xpe led compatible with xpl
I can't see the 3 available on Alix tho
to the UK or USA
where can i get a lm3
my ns59v2 and mf01x made it through
üòé
His parents are rich asf so I'm recommending some nicher lights that I'd like to try out
Ayyy got my little cousin hooked on flashlights
Time for my first dt8 üòéüòé
Oh shit
I can definitely flash it to anduril 2 üòé
Mf01x
Are these flashing pads
How much?
3x21d with sbt90?
Haha they always search my bag extra but there's never a issue with my 15 lights
It has anduril 2 not 1
Oops
So idk why I can't get ramp config going
I'm in the advanced ui, and I've already setup my aux
But when I 4c from on it goes to lockout
Tryna setup the ts11 min and max ramp
D1k time
Oooh
Well..yes
Are there any other warm thrower floorers like hk08
Sick
I didny realise every sanan was available like that
Oh fr
It's apparently 90cri 3000k
16 die, 3v 35A 9500 lumen
Sfh43
I feel like a warm super flooder would be dope
Is the 3000k hk08 a bad idea
But I kinda want it in red
Idk what the difference is
Ace beam k75 V2 just came out
But those others sound good
The aux already show batt voltage
Oh sick
Or what custom features would I add
Whats the benefits of updating
I'll figure out flashing it some other time
Probably
I'll get proper night shots in 10 hours
I think so
And the light output ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Anduril is as good as I remember
Switch is clean
The aux is dope
I finally got it on, I don't even mind if it's bad perf compared to what it should be
I got the lumintop GTA with it too, which is crazy intense for its size and weight
Yup
So I'm not super fussed about underperforming
And for my first AUX light
Yeah I read through it, tbh I have this light mostly to get a cheap San an light and for its bling
Do you know if this side of the carrier can be easily unscrewed
Hopefully it's just in need of another fet
Alright, I'll pop it open when I'm back home (abroad with family rn)
Fr? Is that something I could mod/fix
Nah, that's why I got it so cheap
I just wanna put batteries in üò≠
Nope
So ig it makes sense, he needed grippy pads too
It's the same unit used in the 1lumen review
Damn
Just for a tailcap
Like it won't unscrew
I can't figure out how to open the mf01x tailcap
Hey could someone help me
Oopsie, meant that one
Yeah I'm looking at getting a kr4 and a d1k, d1k with r9070 xhp70 and the kr4 with 5700k DD 519a and kr cslnm
Ohh gotcha
For a sustained the d1v2 is better right
D1k or d1v2
ü§®ü§®ü§®
Ah if I VPN to Poland it works
You polish?
I'm in the USA if it makes a difference
Nah
Is there geo restrictions
It says connection resst
I can't connect to the website
What's so special about them?
I gotta get a anduril one of those
That's the tir thrower right?
Nah daytime use is even better
I honestly barely notice how warm it is, it just doesn't hurt my eyes so much
I want something even warmer and throwier with 519a
But they slap
Idk why warm light get hate for night time outdoors use
3500k DD 519a s21d
Thor 3
Kb cslnm z1
Sst20 Dr c8+
In order
I want to unsee it
I took the UV S2 to a hotel
I made a mistake
The order didn't go through üò≠üò≠ I was on the train and went underground
3 sft40 3000k
3 p45b
3 new lights
It's been a expensive week
amber for the warm candlelight look, the other two for actual useability
amber and xml2/sft40 are most realistic
i think im between, something amber/cyan/pink or a lumen monster sfq55 or the xml2/sft40
better than sft40 3000k
yup
ah ill need a new reflector
a bit of rubbery shmoo came off and then it only turned on when pressed down]
put the wrong size TIR in and absent mindedly screwed it down
thats compatible?
I THINK YOU DID!
really no other way to fix this
is buy a sft40 3000k
i think the only solution here
ahhh
Squished this poor fella under a TIR
Oopsies
and my sofirn sc31 pro didnt work
my blue/grey/steel s2 is a sandy grey
my red c8+ is a rose gold colour after fully baking
the convoy z1 wasnt fully baked so ive got a muddy reddy brown like the duracell colour just darker
on 3 lights
just did this today
yo
I think I'll hit my sc31 pro bezel, s21d head (and torch the SS clip)
Light baking today
Idk how thick you can go max, but I went for 1mm
3d printable
S21d glow gasket
Got it
Nvm
im struggling to design something printable
do they sit underneath?
with glow gaskets, what happens to the wires
ill just print and suck it up and have it in green only
ahh
üòé  smort
ill 3d print it
OH SHIIIT
if not ill suck it up and diy
ah i need something for quadruples tho
for a s21d
i need
oooh
if only they ship tio the UK
ahh
Are these low pressure sodium, found in a old tube station in London (cockfoster station)
Burn out csp led?
Ugly beam?
More expense for little gain?
How come tir flooders don't use additional csp LED like the ts10 around the main emitters
Whatever sustains best of mf01x and ns59 I'll keep üòé
I don't need sustainable anyways
AHH fair
Mf01 drop is pretty abysmal, sustainable around 3k iirc
Oopsie hk08, I couldn't find any reviews
AC, speaking of the mf08, do you know if it steps down super quick like the lumintop rattlesnake
But bright üòé
Yeah it's funky for sure
Or even the mf01x, depends if I like it, I gotta compare the dropoff between that and the ns59
You can have the lishens that came with (ones damaged but idk which) if you want
Might sell my ns59v2
What country?
Got it off the BST
I've got a mf01x on the way üòé
Sick
Still p45b
What's the current best high current 21700
im not bothering to unscrew
ah i think my s2 has the head in one peice
does the s2 head unscrew
i use paypal so i doesnt matter
probably
bouta ask for these off the BST
someone talk me off the edge
1lumen.com/review/lumintop-gta/

i might sell of my nightwatch and get the haikelight instead
how do you think the haikelight hk08 would stack up against a nightwatch ns59v2
2100 or 210?
ahh, hotter than i got then
did you cool it quickly or slowly?
but i gotta get a butane torch, my gas hob just got it red hot glowing and dint really change the colour
i kinda want to anodize mine
so temptingg
heat anodized?
rip
im still too poor
ahh
does the wuben A1 ever go on sale?
keep it spinning until it dries
rotate the pipe with some liquid paint in there
Anything else I should add to the wishlist?
Understandable, I think a gt94x is in my future along with a haikelite hk08, and a owleyes w pro and a couple customs
The sr32 and gt94x are pretty close in throw tho aren't they
Ah cool
I was also thinking over a sr32 or the gt94x
Is the sustainability okay
A ebike batt, reflex reflector and a cbt90
I was thinking diy might be a better option
I can afford up to 600 GBP (preferably around the 400 mark tho)
<@140540414154375168>  sorry to bug you, but you've got the most big boi lights afaik, which is the most fun to play with
same, 3500k dd isnt warm enough
i find my red light is too bright and just blows out all detail
would hank do that combo
oooh
i want a uv and red light - maybe a d4v2 or dt8, but i also want a light with red throw and blue flood that super cheap (just for fun) - theres so many hanks that i want
now i have a job theres just a few things to pay off
im saving up for a bigger light
yeah imma leave it
i wasnt aware of san'an at the time
ah well
i really shoulda gone for a domeless led
yup
mines still pretty crispy white
ah i think i went xhp sadly, i wonder what the perf difference is
its xhp in the ns59v2 riht?
which is similar to the thor 1 in body
and theres the petal
of alll the thor options
the og 1,2,3 are the best in aesthetic and size and function imo
they just arent very popular - or throw
already a thing, 5 and 6 too
and itll do this every time it turns on
but you put it in lowest mode, when it blinks you switch it off then on
its a bit silly
i got it
ohhh
how do i move to the 3 mode
im in 5 mode currently
but if its the 3/5 mode
yeeeh
nah didnt work
im not too sure
this guy: 
How do I switch this driver off of a mode group with strobes
hey quick question, how do you change drier group on the s2 driver, ive got either the 3 or 5 mode driver

What size
What's the candela like ü§î
It's beautiful
But veeery rosy
Still not warm enough üò≠
Dedomed the 519a 3500k
And try dedome 2 of the 4 519a in the s21d
Imma get a warm thrower next
Especially at night
I think I'm in love with this warm tint stuff
There's nothing quite like it
519a 3500k
Got my s21d!
I wanna see ts11 Vs 12
Dude is on the ball
I had a reply from Simon last night before I closed the app
ah cool, illsee whats most easily available, opple doesnt ship to me in the UK, unless theres a USA store with fast shipping ill have to find an alternative
hows the "x-rite i1 Display Pro" sound
instead of a opple
what about USA?
unavailable
where did you uk folk get your opple 3, i cant find anywhere that sells it for a reasonable price
if you figure out anduril on there, id buy one instantly
i wondered why simon wasnt shifting my parcel
ohhh
lmk what you think of maeerxu
running out of budget here
eek
can the opple 3 be used a luxmeter for runtime measurments/ relative brightness
ohhh  thatt one is sick
you can buy those phosphor discs on aliex
i suppose so
what for?
or, 9 die uv beast LED in a convoy s11 host
How much??
I'm just a cheap imitation, hopefully, I'm not buying from them though- imma diy
Well my plans to get a double whammy, both a right angle and a anduril convoy
And a biiig UV light
I'll get a anduril convoy
Imma try my hand at modding this summer
I'm so pumped
And it's just a little bit of sanding and a standard driver swap
Okay
Ooh
Cause I've been eyeing the h1 as my first right angle, only dislike is convoy ui
I don't know exactly how hank drivers work, but if I were to copy you and ask Hank for a driver- would I need to say for xyz LED
Yeah iirc it's a double stack die
How do you swap it
A anduril convoy h1 would be so sick
The convoy h1?
on reddit
hahahaha edc trade
although for uv id rather a tailswitch and acess to 3 simple modes
yeah is the m3c better
although its 7070 ot 9090
12v driver preinstalled
i think this will be my perfect uv host
and ill just try eyeball if the relflector hole is big enough
so no calculations needed, just chuck it in a try
gaskets i can print in sizes increasing from 0.1mm
or will any large enough reflector work if i can get the height correct
it also occured to me, how tf do you know if a reflector will focus the LED correctly
haha just a noob trying to imitate the guy
maybe ill just copy sakowuf solutions
eh id rather not bodge
the LED needs 12v
what size is the driver
wait
id like to try put a fatass UV led in there
anyone know the l21b mcpcb size
beatiful
and the219b with its lower DUV wouldnt be betrter?
thanks!
ill get that 3500k and dedome at home
or is the 219b/c got a lower duv
whatevers warmest on a 519a i think
hm, ill just get it with a reflector then
i reallt just need something to mimic golden hour sunlight
is there much loss in lumens
ahh
would that not work
my plan was to 3d print a ring thatd support the glass lens
oh wdym spacer?
I'll start with a super warm S2+ for photos, and if I dislike it but the cool 519a
I wanna buy a warm and a cool 519a pill
I'm one step ahead
"mule"
But you see
Ah
Might try make it a hotswap mule
Perfect
Is the S2+ pill swappable without solder
Are s2+ pills easily swappable, could I buy a pill with warm 519a and cool 519a and switch between them without solder
ty
Ive had the light for a while but never managed to capture this on camera, is it worth contacting simon
It shows up in the beam too
The kB cslnm I think
There's a bit of a spot of discolouration on my blue z1
But I guess it's all the same if it doesn't make a difference
Naw my sc31 pro has a plasticy coat
To help in case of a rip in the batt
What if the tube had a non conducting coating
Nooo
üíÄ
So more lumens at that intensity
But is it led
Ooh I think my Thor 3 is close
I'd get stabbed üíÄ
Step outside in America and get lit up
Too gun like
Although that's not really too useful
I might get a super warm and a super cool emitter and use channel mixing
Oh is the d4k dual channel
ohohoh whatd you do
came from a lot of blf trawling
i cant take cred
Reflective Christmas baubles
Or
I'm thinking spray mirror + resin prints
I need to get around to trying a couple DIY solutions
WAVIEN. COLLAR
im between getting a TI maeerxu plus two d1v2 (one floody and one throwy)   OR    a ti d4v2
i might try recreate that
do you remeber that person who made a wooden insiert for their s2 a while back on reddit
also
sick
whatd i need to polish it
ooh that sounds nice
im also gonna pickup a s2 o try mod a bit
this light is gonna be my pretty EDC
stonewash or raw?
got 120 quid to burn
idk if thats right tho
2 1
is that 14h
how do you do a version check?
<@140540414154375168>
Whatcha need @wol
I have one
not even that bad, my parents tolerate it, ive got 12 so far üí™  and got a job to fund the rest
that. is. beautiful
25 gbp
surely its all around better than a 519a no?
im also kinda eyeing up the sfn60 3000K ,idk about the heat tho
the d1v2 or b35am?
just be careful about your eyes
obv ive got polycarb goggles on while doing all this tho
and i cant snap a photo of what im working on if need be
dont wanna piddle with a UV LED
i just use 100% for everything anyways
ah, i ceiling bounce it for some stuff
i feel like im being slow, wdym lose detail? like the flouresence is too bright it washes out other details
wdym?
a lot of others just fluoresce even if they arent UV cure
and to check what type of plastic ive printed a part in
and to check for flux after soldering
ocasionally when i disassemble stuff i use it to check for adhesives
i carry mine between my desk and bed all the time, its usefull
with a 10deg tir
quad vs single
ooh d1k b35am or s21d with 519A
do you think it would be any floodier or about the same
the range is similar to a sc31 pro too which i really love
im tempted
Ooh
imgur for images, text on blf and reddit imo
he looked so tired in that photo
What country are you at, I kinda want in
Yeah there's a single sst20 and 519a version with a larger tir
Then use a low current quad setup
What about the s21e single
You could probably switch a s21d board into a s21e and get a quad side switch light
imma try find a copper cylinder to use instead
I tried a tail spring from a if25a which was noticeably dimmer in turbo than the magnets. It was on for less than 5 seconds and was well over 80c when I took it out the torch. I placed it between the two batteries as a spacer
Magnets were fine
Tldr
Tried a couple spacers on the ns59
It's two magnets
How can I better measure
cause my probe goes 200ohm --> 200Kohm
ive never got the scale for ohm
ohm
Is a 8ohm resistance in my battery spacers too high?
what LEDs? also beamshots üôè
ah nice üòÖ  i got mine when the beaded 60 was the only available option so it was quite useless for anything but dense urban walks
and what TIR did you get
oh man i miss my s21d, hows it feel in your pocket
if you can keep bubbles out it wouldnt impact the beam would it
wat if you run mineral oil over the leds, direc die cooling
is definitely a nice light tho
wdym, the q8 plus has been out for a while
Gotta wait 3 hours for dark
Red c8 arrived üòéüòé
lodnon
theres more crime here, ive been mugged and know at least 4 other people who have been in 2023
florida has clear rainy and dry seasons, and their rain is heavy/fleeting. london rains for a day or two but its very light
its a mix
not really, theres not a clear warm and cold and wet and dry season
yeah obviously theres downsides
all 30m walks maximum
3 gyms walking distance, 4 middle schools. 2 train stations, 6 bus routes, 3 high streets, 4 large shops, 3 pharmacies, 2 dentists
and walkability
but i like public transport
nor have i lived anywhere else
and to be fair, i dont pay bills
i love london
its nasty
slept in their living room with the litter box
bloody hell, my aunts house is B.A.D
shouldnt be any problema
if the battery stayed healthy
i dont think so
when you say on?
he managed to set the thermistor to read room temp as 60c
i know i had crazy stepdowbn on my sc31 pro for no reason after i lent it to my baby cousin
might you have set the internal temp or voltage readout too high/low by accident
T5 is around 2.25mm
T4 at its widest is around 1.55mm
Measure the screw from one point to another, I've got my t5 set here
Oh actually I dunno how long of a screw it is
Not a lot of it, realy a teeny dab. It's a good alternative for people who don't have the right threadlocker
Cause Ew only 3/4 ü§Æ
You can break nail polish easily, it's a nice temp threadloc
With a lil nail polish on the end  on the thread to lock it
Just screw it in by hand
id bet thats fromn phosphor between the dies
most of it got binned, i kept the tailcap tho
UK
just dont ask to see it when its dark out
but the torch looked so cool afterwards üòé
turns out thats a big no no for electronics
i also tried de anodizing it
if anyone wants 3 sst20 inside a if25a its up for grabs
then i managed to cut into one of the sst 20 and kill it. so ive left it be with just 3 LED
tbf i took my friends old if25a and just removed the lens and replaced it with a polycarb lens and 3d printed spacer
it was the furthest out part of the light and it fell led facing down
was trying it as a mule and ive got butter fingers
i mean dropped onto the dies, like onto gravel
i dropped mine a couple times
those dies are pretty solid though, they wont break if youre careful
and avoid exposing the bond
so a strip down the middle
or it looks like the bond wires are on the left and right side
ye and remnove phosphor on  only one half
but dedome the side far away from the lil nubby bit
so one half is dedomed and the other is stock
try cutting it in half
got a pic?
these ones?
how come?
others..not so much
some LED are really delicate
dang my de-phosphored led took 20v once
Also this zoomies LED is surprisingly nuetral
photos
oooh
maybe if it has bond wires try cutting down the middle and dedoming/ scraping deom there only
üò¨ that burnt looking phoo of a 519a and other components?
just scrape at shit or bake it to see wtf happens
i wish there was more experimenting like this in the community
this is the kinda jank i love
dang thats sick
üôè
pics pleeease
well get yer dick outta it
hows the beam
BEATIFUL
doom is iminent
My newest zoomie is quaking in its boots
and well centered ü§î
lemme get a pic of mine
just with a knife
i scraped off all the yellow phosphor
tbf i got it for free with a battery purchase
just make sure theres no bond wires
scrape
how does the lens come out
sameee except i dedomed and removed phosphor for a cheapo blue light
other than cut away metal
how do i grip it?
ah didnt see tat at first
ooh the plastic one?
that front ring doesnt budge
How tf do you get this open
I'll be copping a pro lantern this summer the
üòç
üòÇ
Security came over to ask about the bright lights
Had a rite of passage moment
Ignore my recommendations then I'm a budget boy at heart
Sent me a whole new torch when I only asked for a new head
Convoy if25a, sp36,
All good wurkkos lights
Ts25
Ts10
Fc13
Ts22?
Yup
And a dedicated white
Can always get the s2 with sst20 dr 660nm
I use it for a easier shipping hub
Parcels app
It's for a 25 GBP order
When did convoy shipping get so fast
Safety
Mmmm
Make sure the only side that can short is connected to the charger not battery
Careful with magnet chargers
Happened to me 2 days ago
Also wouldn't it be the sr32
Which LED option is brightest?
i was just pestering him about it today
or gt fc40
that sfn55??
üòã
whats gonna give me a more lightsaber-y beam
z1 or c8+ with blue LED
hm- my german vpn still lets me view it
what country??
is it real
whats that stone?
beatiful photos
Sounds like the threads are longer than the head
Yeah torches need more contrast in their colour
Cheap zoomies are a good source if you don't mind being hacky
Inspection lights look like that
A aspheric?
Sanded the sc31 pro clip down to bare alum
is the z1 with KB CSLNM worth ¬£11 more than the S2+ with KB CSLNM
I'll buy my first proper EDC then
I wish this worked on convoys tok
12.50 for a ts10 with battery with this trick üòÄüòÄ
Ts10 time üòé
Oooh
close doesnt have to be perfect if its free üòâ
i dont mind having a small section of my torch showing heavy wear- like a right of passage
im too poor for TI so im getting the closest
thats what im tryng first, random tail cap
sc31 pro, proably just a small section
i didnt have any good stuff with sodium hydroxide
imma try a little sanding first
personally, ill pass on heating the super flammable stufffs and live with an anodized light
sitting outdoors freezing my feet off rn
yeah
is this any good
lemme get a pic
some oven cleaner
do i need to give it a light sand first
cause i left a tail cap in there for a solid 10m and nothin happened
soidum hydroxide is what i want right?
de anodizing some torches
QUICK QUESTION
Thats the same as the sc31 pro isn't it. How'd you get it to fit and screw down all the way? Also is it waterproof?
ohh only if its only 15 id trust it over diy then]
2 wires, some heatshrink and a braided sleeve
if its just power in that cord you could easily DIY that
no side switch. to access turbo on a switch with such long travel is a absolute pain
but still very good value
its not exactly budget
both around ¬£100 shipped
the haikelite hk05 has 30k lumesn of throw
the ns59v2 has 30k lumens of flood
Mb
You want 1x
Think I misread that, thought it was a 10x bigger number
And has a TI option ü§§ü§§
Cause the convoy t4 is that form factor
<@383051269214044172> is that 2x aaa
Yeah idk how someone in China hasn't manufactured them already
i dont think a larger hemisphere would increase output
i think just as big as fits in a host (and entirely surrounds the LED)
im interested mostly so i can get a lightsaber Z1
and that should give you a lot less spill and a lot more light in the spot when zooming in with a zoomie
the end lens is just an aspheric
the lens  (i think) goes in the same position as on a zoomie
just the reflective hemisphere
ive been procrastinating on making a waiven collar with 3d printed parts for a while
then heat tint it
probably a second hand or very cheap ti light
Or ugly
All my lights are far too large
I gotta get a pretty light like that to take everywhere
L21b with sft40 would be my go to, what range are you working at
You mean a large hotspot thrower
Those are opposite?
ive got a sv31 pro
do you have a sp31
its very weak tho
mine shows as a veeery pale blue on a lot of plastics and other surfaces
rip
ah
do they have a higher top voltage vs c123a?
Yeah you need the same voltage, maybe two 16340s?
Cheap zoomie putting in the work üí™üí™
Vwhoom get a face full of void
That'd be sick
Surely thats just any flashlight switched off
Is that a thing
Erm
So cool
ü•∫ü•∫
In a thrower
BUT
Not a lot of actual illumination
I feel blind using it
But terribly useless imo
Blue is fun
mhm
you take the torch, huck it in a box and ship her here to me
to free your hands
i have a program
ahaah
if25a
lumens per sq m
which i think is what lux is???
per sq meter
sorry, meant predict brightness at a distance,, you could plot a graph of candela against distance and get lumens per sq m at range from that
one sec
candela does change with distance i thibk
what unit of intesity are we talking about
but using inverse square law we predict the intensity
so intensity across the beam and across different ranges will change
and use inverse squae law
surely we measure intensity lux/m^2 at a known distance
The rest is burnt it looks
Around the hole looks good
Tried some heat anodizing
Flashlight version could be and 18650 or button cells almost direct wired to a couple coloured led (the cheap plastic lens ones)
Oh it's meant literally, thought they meant a flashlight version
Depending on how big that is and how bright you want it it could be very easy
That actually open and closes?
and whats different between far and deep red
in terms of wave legnth whats the reddest red, blueest blue and greenest green
either this is you or its odly good timing]
so less lumens
itll get hotter faster
yes
flood just makes me anxious cause i cant see far enough ahead
the spill is enough for walking and the thrower lets me see whats up ahead
i prefer walking with a thrower
oh we got complete opposites
i know a couple guys up there, they could print for you, the design is the easier part
in the UK?
id agree with jazz here, if i need throw ill probably need it for a while, id rather a larger light, a edc IMO should be floodier
you got a 3d printer?
Ah
Link?
thor 1 is pretty small
But the light üë®‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë®üë®‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë®üëà
I can't find turbo half the time cause it's 2 half clicks very quickly
My biggest gripe is the UI. Such a L for something that should momentarily be in high it's a pain to hold and change modes often
And it's got alright throw for its flood
It's a wide, neutral beam
But my lord
No numbers
Yea
I have one
WOOOOO
i loved my s21d, only gripe was it wasnt side switch
i NEEEED
guuhhhhhh
im no professional and certainly dont know much of whats going on at the driver level. but if you want to send some photos i can try explaining as much as know
no problem, whats it for?
made of copper, thy put paste under it to connect to a "shelf" inside the light
ther'll be a board like this
pretty much afaik, the potting covers the driver too
yes, potted is all over the elctronics, but theyll usually have some paste between the mcpcb and the body
which opple light meter model is best
ASAP
On mobile rn so can't look to well but I doubt it's less than 600 gbp
Found the maxa blaster
thank you, ill give it a try!
i dont want to add too much resistance
im worried the alum foil wont be enough
i wouldnt mind noise but its disconnecting and it thinks ive pressed the switch to change modes
i think its vertical not side to side
Also, if the batteries are a bit loose in the tube (shake and it changes mode) what do I put in there to keep them tight?
No nightmode camera needed
Gah damn
Just got the ns59v2
but this seems a bit too cheap
id love to have coloured light filters
and a nightwatch ns59v2
would this work to colour a LEP
And for cooling I've got a spare CPU cooler but would that short the PCB if I place it directly on there?
For functionality I'd like to be able to switch between individual emitters
I need the LEDs, driver, cooling and a body (3d printed)
So to DIY
But it's expensive
I wanna try coloured emitters
yeah it probably that, i was gonna say the q8 but it doesnt come in a sand colour
Was it very floody or throwy?
if its from a vid can you link iy
im getting the nightwatch ns59v2
i hope they dont try use it
AYYYY, ill ship to the US then and have family hold it
i thought he was USA but someone said china?
wheres nealgadget at
ive been here 2 years and still only have 4 lights
gah damn#
is it bright enough to hurt your eyes indoors
you got a q8 plus?
neither is pocketable
i suppose so
but its not anduril
nightwatch with xhp seems to have higher lumens
which is best?
i can afford both
Sofirn Q8 Plus OR Nightwatch NS59v2
what now???
hopefuly around 60 but 80 tops
most lumens in a flooder for under 80?
soz
total value 375, the nearest equiv is the ms18
yes officer, those 3 21700 where inside my torch
yeah im all good, thankfully got all my stuff second hand so the equivalent from insurance will be a upgrade
got mugged, might get a lil upgrade with the payout üòÖ
and whats the best flooder in a price bracket around 50 ish
awesome
and most expensive place to buy a s21d
hey whats a really expensive 21700 battery
well worth ut though, i got a thor 3 on sale for 100 gbp shipped
whats the beam from yours like, i got the wider angle beaded TIR, ive never seen a smooth one
yeah mines got that too
more comfortable to change modes without moving the torch
i kinda prefer side switch too
the thor 3 is same (ish) size as the l21b
thor2 is pocketable but not as much throw
the thor 3 is ~96 on a good deal
But on a dog walk it's GT3 everytime
I'd EDC my if25a but not a gt3
Different class
I suppose
Multi emitter is fulfilled with a s21d or a if25a if that's more your style
Ah yes budget multi cells
like the s21d
budget would be sub 50 imo
buget!? the gt3 is like ¬£100
Like pushing a swing, the magnet is just pushing back?
Possibly extra vibrations since the magnetic field from the cap pulls extra on the inductors as they switch on and off and create a field
Iirc that's the inductors oscillating
i thought it was too big to get a hand around the normal handle
its so smoll
VID pleee
they were talking about a zig zag shaped internal (like a slinky) to get insane melt zone per volume
im excited for my beta unit, the whole team get one
is that the Goliath
now wait a minute
depends where the driver decides to shut off or limit output
Awesome!
ah i see, bright fo its size, its not very throwy is it?
90cri
unless im seeing one with different LEDs
oh uh ali said only 1.4k lumens
any beamshots, most ive seen online look way too bright  compared to irl
ah thts the thor1 LED version. all the leps are around 100 rn
ill show u some beamshots
ive got a thor 3, its my most prized flashlight
driver, idk what the inside looks like. but if the positve and minus is being shorted before the battery then it wouldnt receive power
like its + and - being shorted
perhaps the pcb is being squished when fully tightened, so the driver csnt do anything
It doesn't remove the green entirely but I found some of them to make it less focused so there's no green spot
Try a TIR or a minus green filter
uk, im not too pressed for time so no worries
how many lumens?
id buy, probably
Burnt MOSFET somewhere that fails on?
step 3 plug and look at bulb
add bits
step two
make pcb
step one
High ISO, slow shutter speed, tripod
no turbo
LEP üò¢
I tried a cloth but it doesn't pick up the buts
How do I get all this dust off
L21B MY BELOVED üòçüòçüòç
you could diy one out of u stock aluminium
id love a bamshot that actually resembled what you see irl, like similar fov and brightness
as if camera was wearing
POV beamshots, show how the flashlight looks when its actually in use
Yeah I always do
Head, battery, tailcap and tube all separate. The heads the most expensive part so I'd keep that close. I will say tho I've never had TSA take my lights (l21b, s21d and sc31 in a bag together) they usually just want to see the batteries and turn the light on
Can always dissemble it
There you go
The cree rainbow block?
Otherwise you could DIY one easily
Semi translucent white
You in the uk,? I've got some glow in the dark filament
Mmmm blindness
I did tell them before. They insisted on a bright light
Eh I'll warn them
And give them a very serious warning
But show them turbo
I'll just set the ramp to really low
Eh. Kinda notmaproblem
But aim for 60 they said
They gave me a price range of up to 100
But it's my loaded aunt buying it so doesn't matter
Yeh
Most expensive light is my l21b üòé
15, no job
Since I can't afford it personally
For me
Much fun
11k iirc
They have a fairly large property. And I suppose rather have the capability if turbos needed but limit the ramp
Thank you for all the help
Ergonomic don't matter. They have bigass hands. So it seems if the budget allows. Q8 pro. If not sp36 pro
Awesome. Is their any reason to choose it over q8 pro other than price
Cool and it has anduril?
Builtin charging that is
Charging is a must. Runtime is important, any hobbyist light will have more lumens than the 20yr old home depot light
Oh I see
As long as it beats their old one
So ease of use and runtime are partly most important
This will be their first light
Better than their pro counterparts for backup
And tell them to only use the ramp
And I'll just limit the ramp
Rhan their pro versions
Ah so q8 default and sp36 blf are better
There's 2 pro variants were talking about
Sp36 pro or q8 pro?
I'll show them both and let them decide
Hm possiblly
But they might be able to stretch the budget
I like the look of the q8 pro but it's a little too expensive
USB charging preferred as they don't have a charger
USA , shipping time doesn't matter
400m throw at most really
More floody
Price up to 60-70
Size isn't a concern
Long runtime is preferred
Beam quality isn't a concern
I'm looking for a backup light for a aunt
Well the convoy z1 exists
just needs a ms18
cap marvel?
is that about a superhero
beautiful  photo
or blue c8, 20 gbp
sst 420 with dn reflector
unfortanutely its all sold out
ts10 on sale for 18 usd with free shipping
i am a reviewer
yes
hi
buy b for 45 total and save some for something else
buy a and spend it all
do i
ive got 120 to spare
my bad, was looking on mobile 
A 1000w 48v meanwell PSU is roughly 50 quid. Although you could probably find a similar spec server PSU for less
Pretty much. You can always combine the two to have the dps5020 and PSU in one case. The screen should tell you the output current and voltage so I'd make sure the screen and adjustments are visible
Isn't the point of the dps5020 that it steps down the current and voltage for you. So you'd just want a 48v PSU a hot swappable fuse and some banna jacks
60v is pretty much instant death
I wouldn't go anywhere higher than 48v
Are you experienced with high voltages
I like it
That brick shape fits in pocket better too
othwewise why such a huge jump in lumens
so that seems like it casn sustain a high of 2000-3000 but has a peak of 12000 but wont sustain that
if mines slightly off does it ave much impact
does LED centering matter a ton for throwers
the stabby kind 
which is where it got its name
from the lord of the rings
sword
anduril is the name of a sword from lord of the rings i think
The beam is cleaned up with a tir easily
While I don't mind the poor cri. The greenish tint is nasty
Or any of the other sc31 models
Sc31 pro is the only one I know of
no worries
did you mean to @ someone else? im not even sure what mao anodizing is
pvc pipe with a section cutout and a drilled hole, put threaded caps on the side or press fit caps maybe?
It might shake loose
You might want a magnet or a cage around the light
Hm
Will it be permanently kept there or will you want to take it off often
Yeah just be careful the screw doesn't come loose
So there's a tripod hole which makes my life much easier
Oh do you use magnets instead of a screw on collar
Lemme see if I can find or design a mount for it before I make any promises
If you can wait I'll be in the us soon and we can do shopping with USPS
Hm. I was gonna offer a couple 3d printed mounts for pretty much any torch
Are you in the UK?
Not sure sorry, I stick to budget lights
My qualms with the light are: greenish tint (I have some TIR on the way to hopefully smooth that), warms up very quickly, beam is the ugliest I've ever seen (TIR on the way)
I love my sc31 pro. It's a good way to get into anduril at a low cost (14 gbp without battery) and it's ridiculously bright for the cost
also how do i view the not i left him?
dont fit on the led?
yeah, guess im figuring out how to mod my light
cheaper to buy a lighted switch/other cheap accessory than just the TIR
Maybe I'll mod my S21D
That's convoy right
Visited the Luxor, would not recommend, pool was underwhelming and there's nothing but gambling to do there
Other than diy or asking someone experienced in using an airgun I don't think you can get one
Are you in the UK?
dw ive got a friend in the netherlands, im checking how much it costs now
Bruh wurkkos cancelled my order for a defective dl70 cause I'm in the UK
Nope, super tight
it arrived yesterday and i have a hike on sunday that i need it for. if it is broken will convoy let me send it back after the use on the hike assuming no visual damage
is my 21d broken, when i switch to the highest mode (100% group 10) the light becomes dim until i slightly press the button, then it moves into 100%. its a noticeable difference but hard to capture on camera
cheule has a video talking about it
iirc thats only if you break the glass no?
is there any risk in removing too much copper
i can print a spacer if needed
cause ive got a 3d printer
when you say that, do you mean i might need a non conductive spacer to help it assemble
cool, do you know if the dl70 applies pressure to the LED or will i need to glue it
fujik: 1.1 w/mk      boron nitride paste: 29-96 w/mk      mx-4: 8.5w/mk. higher is gooder right?
cool, normal thermal paste is okay
is boron nitride (sets solid) okay to use or should i get a good thermal paste
nah just a manufacturing issue with a small batch
The problem is: the LED board is not completely flat on the lamp holder, so there is a problem with heat dissipation, and it is easy to burn out in high output.
otherwise that doesnt sound too difficult, ive got plenty of time to fiddle with it
can i remove the mcpcb and then lap it like you would on a CPU. i have a clamp already plus a soldering iron. for thermal paste can i use boron nitride paste or would thermal grizzly be better
this would make a great torch for my grandpa to keep around (low idle drain and high output with good drop resistance). also what interface does it use?
just to get a rough idea, how hard would it be to fix
thank you for pointing that out
if i get one itll be that
one quid more
not much more expensive either
still a little hesistant to buy a bright light that i cant even see, ya know
havent bought yet
and 16 day shipping
nope, logged in and im seeing this
cool, thats mostly what i'd use it for. if i can dredge up a spare ¬£15 ill buy it
yeah its cheaper than anything else ive seen so far
sure can, in your honest opinion factoring cost and hw often you use it (and what you use it for). how would you rate it
huh, weird ill buy their LED then
is that any worse or just different
same effect as nichia
it says seoul led is what it uses
just reread
The listing I'm looking at says "like nichia uv led" does that mean it is the nichia uv or is it just a similar effect
Nah UK.  But I've family in the US so I can take shipments from there
may as well
5x times the money, youve just talking me into the s2
idk that like 5x more
ohhh i though he was just mentiomning original value
oh no. how much?
im thinking about buying a UV torch (s2+ UV with zwb filter) shipping is for 16 days from now and i need someone to talk me out of it
any existing designs, my skills are kinda meh
i have a 3d printer
oh?
anyone know if theres single battery wide, extension tubes that puts cells in parralel. id like longer runtime from my sc31 pro and parralel would get me that
still cool tho
it melts itself after 30s or so
i built the light
where would i look, this is my first endeavour in building/modding a light
i can connect 2 cells for higher max current
cooling no issue, i think
yeah i wrote the triangle wrong, fixed now
thats fine right?
change of plan, 3 batteries (same as mentioned) and ill just touch wires together to power on
Ah, it's from a laptop. From a bank of 10 iirc
Is that very high or very low
Yeh
i=vr
2=3.3xR
2/3.3=R
R=0.606
safety value 0.8x0.606= 0.5ohm
someone mind checking this logic is sound
its for a LED that can handle 5A max, but the switch im using can handle 2A max so im adding a resistor to limit current
the battery can handle 3A  max
so im gonna direct drive the led (a P70 knockoff)
so a resistor should help, do i limit current to my LED's max or the batteries max
resistor time?
power in what sense, current?
is there anything wrong with direct wiring a LED to a 18650
other than heat
quick question before i break soemthing
im just gonna glue everything to the heatsink and have a mule
probably, but i just said fuck it and designed a 18650 holder with a spring and found a old passive heatsink and a switch
not gonna be super high perf but at least ill have it in a day or two
designing a mule
Damn that guy's bright
Or is there a way to get 3v from a 12vpsu
I just need on/off
So can I just wire it directly to a 18650 with a heatsink under kt
It's 3v
Ah true
12v?
Welp
Wait nvn they're 9v
Cool, unfortunately I have no 3v line. So I'm just gonna toss it on a 6v battery and let it rip
Yeah
Not a clue, which is why I'm stuck
Or how can I figure out how many
How many volts does this LED need
That sure is low
Million ohm or milli ohm
What if you have integrated charging and never open it
What's the change?
Plez
Elaborate
Yeah, would a diffuser from a monitor work?
That's my bad. Misread a comment
 Meant the quad emitter one. Anything better and close in price
One sec
Hm
The s21b I'm looking at has 3 emitters
Any flashlights similar to price but with more flood than a s21b
At that size you could do one per Led damb
Yup I do UK and USA
That's a lot of lumens
DAMN
my w5050sq3 5000K survives 8a buck very well
Much better üòé
Thermistor as a variable resistor in the fans path
mine activates at 11pm but otherwise i agree
true, only have dd 2700k 519a
but im pretty sure my office lights are above bbl so im probably adjusted to the green
cant see it at all on my 1800k
i certianly belive you if the 6000k are anything to go by
ill have to check them out
yeah i cant tell by eye at all then ü§£
is the warm sft40 yellow?
i suppose it varies between people a lot
oh fr? i can never notice green in warm light
yep, its really strong and gradual so unless your switching two lights on and off you wouldnt notice your brain doing it
tint is the amount of pink or green in the light, temp is the warmth which is kinda the same. someone else will have to help explain. but 3000K warm light can be green or rosy but its hard to tell whereas 5700k its super obvious
temp /= tint
to be fair you dont have any rosy lights in the pic, our eyes adapt to tints very quickly
<@1271136802312421476> ^
plus id imagine a better thermal transfer (overall) would mean the LED could be driven harder but then efficiency is lower and the temps are as high as before, just now with a raised peak brightness. eventually everything heat soaks and reaches a equilibrium and your temp is the same
it doesnt make much difference as the LED ---> mcpcb thermal transfer isnt the limiting factor, the mcpcb ---> shelf and shelf ---> host and host ---> air are far larger limiters
tbf only once or twice
im about to head out for a holiday tho
ABS, itll be okay to about 90c iirc
You design it, I'll print and send it
might use a dc motor to spin a contact
idk if i can move my hand fast enough
potato potato
[PepeFightMe](
break out the nichrome wire and make a diy PTC?
how di reach critical?
iirc mines around 4v
[sadge~3](
<@346077022155440140>  jank check?
they have a range tho
ohh, nah its a ceramic heater in the centre
these sort
resistor
roughly 50x50x4 maybe
and ill monitor via thermocouple
the iron does that already
its more fun my way
and ive got a thermocouple
thatll be my project tomorrow
ive got a copper slug
ive got a amazon iron
ive got a drill
yk what
i will sooner use a spare copper block and a spare iron to make my own hotplate
i started slicing, tested with a multimeter and thought id broken it and then sliced off the phopshor so i didnt try reuse a broken LED in the future. then realised its a 6v LED and my multimeter wouldnt light it up ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
IT HAS PRECISE TEMPERATURE CONTROL SO ITS NOT JANKY
yeah its how i do all of them
ive got a gtfc40 i could reflow but itll be overdriven for sure
in my defense, its my first time working on a xhp70
irl it has a odd mix of greenish white and royal blue

ive had them for a day
i think the s6 is just LVP tho ü§£
nah nah, i broke them on my own
but ill fix them
ive already broken both lights ü§£
its not that big a problem
odd
cheers
ive probably messed it up then
<@136231916469878784> did this happen before I messed with this
cheers
yeah, the sp33s has some nice sustain soi think ill go for r70 then from simon
so i should get a r90 xhp70.3 hi?
okay
fine
oh fr
[LinusStare](
so slice and remove excess pour
yeah i was aiming for more throw and less shift

Slice a xhp70.2 and remove phohspor on edge?
I didn't reply to deci originally because I doubt I count
It's such a shame
Use someone who's done it before
Ive worked on lights for wolfgirl and bought lights off salty who can vouch for me
I'm available for all of the foreseeable future
Yeah if UK counts as EU then I'm down
Climbing?
are there any well nknown in the community modders in the UK
theres nowhere that the decals dont line up or have separation
only place that id suspect is on the threads
is the body anodized or is it a wrap?
Nah I can't tell if that's a ledge or a seam
Wait
It might be glued but you just need to unscrew it, get the glass and reflector out and all good
Right after the fins at the front
There's a bezel
Cheers, just had to check cause the 14500 clicky maeerxu is 20mm üòÇüòÇ
Before I buy the driver for my df02 I wanted to see if I could grab two at once
Do the generic c8 generally use 17 or 20mm drivers?
super low lows would be nice but i already have a ts10
i never use AUX as they annoy me when i sleep and otherwise these stay in my pocket
buy this and call it a day might be wisest
A brass pipe would easily extend it to send a signal and a custom PCB could line up
Can you buy momentary switches in the right format
Would be sick to use one with the super lows
Maybe I'll figure out a way to use a hank
Is it worth it? I'm seeing some European friends soon but is the cwf that much better than a xoncoy
Honestly I barely care about aux but it seems a waste to have it and not use
So I doubt I'd leave them on
That's alright, these aux draw a tonne of power vs normal ones
I'm told it can do "dual channel" with the aux
20mm convoy driver in a df02 or the dragon driver?
Also
<@1095905667413458965> got a link to it on AE?
does the solder not bridge them anyways?
Or do it with alginate
Time to find a CAD model
I've got a tube of sticks like shit, I might try a custom S2 UV TIR
would a silicone TIR need a different geometry to a regular one?
5 days üëâ üëà
you first and lend it to me üòù
hm ill give it a look
whats the beam like, im quite fond of my culpm
hm maybe
round die?
ws5050 (the round die thingy) in a lumintop GTA? or buy a l21b/c8+ ws5050
Id personally just give it a go with a cheapo module and see if it survives
How long would you be using it for?
I'd try a large one off AliExpress then, those constant current buck modules with heatsinks
Wall power a possibility?
depends what the form factor is and how reliable it needs to be and what kinda airflow there is
could try a xl4015
it handles 2.5A 5.2V very well inside a heated chamber
[thinkies](
lm2596
should handle 15W
i use it to run my pi 3b just fine
LM2596, adjustable from any value and fairly cheap
Oh that's cool
How's it do that
this is possibly one of my least jank ideas
shouldnt be too tough
gonna use it like a lathe
thats the plan for cuting it too
They're smaller than the +ve terminal tho
Hm
The old ones were steel
Might settle on the convoys
Yeah the shipping is rough
Got some brass rods that I plan to cut by hand
So replacing with nice springs
I just fucked up the springs already since the locking post broke
Yeah it is
Just the stock driver
group buy ü§®
hopefully ill get a super low resistance and a brighter turbo
gonna use becu springs and longer brass posts
fixing up the mf01x
Also, do you have any BeCu springs, I just realised I need 3
It's great right
Yippee
i ordered the domed ages ago and im not all too bothered to re-order, wait, and then reflow
If it's the right size
Gonna reflow to a x3
Closest slice I could manage on a xpg4 to reduce shift
Replace with xpg4?
to replace the red LED or the lh351d
xpg4 in a wuben x3 ü§® ?
Cool cool, later on is best interested to see, I was looking to buy over of those too
Beampic?
They were so dim anyways, idrc
It's on the mf01x
Anything wrong with just removing it and having no aux?
Fair enough
What resistance? Across which pads?
Maybe just bridge the pad?
It's for some AUX
Is there any way to bodge the fix
It's a mosfet
An a25hb broke on one of my lights
Otherwise DIY it with my own clicky ui design
I was gonna drop in a ts10 switch and extend the brass insert they have and drop in a ts10 driver
And if I go the route of a custom driver instead of ts10 driver would <@841664416134463540> help me a bit? (DW if not I'm just trying to scope out this project)
Does the inner tube act as a signal or power
I'm thinking of converting a df02 to use a ts10 driver
That's the quantum putty something or other stuff isn't it
Wow that's an impressive low
I want
Ooh does it turn off entirely at those lows or is it suuuuper dim
What light is that <@425448934987530240>
I'm not up to date on the different topologys
Why not a 1+3+fet or whatnot
Ah cool
What's the benefits
Why?
oh true
ive got a spare broken one if youre any good at component repair if youd like
simon sells them for 22mm iirc
is that not just dropping in a 12v driver
was it not snake
do you mean the l21a
i dont have a s12 sorry
But I had a 6 quid Simon order need returning
My biggest buy was 2k üíÄ
no hot plate?
What's it going to be used for
Very cool
are there gerber files on that blf thread
https://github.com/AfterEarthLTD/Solder-Reflow-Plate
might try to replicate this myself
hm, are they okay on a hotplate to solder?
ah okay, so if i had them assemble everything common and then DIY the uncommon bits itd be cheap-ish
damn even just for one, what about partial asseembly?
jlcpcb wouldnt do it~?
W A N T
[thinksmart](
design a overboost and ill have it made
def a single then
a single would be compatible with convoys too
but
i think id want a quad more than a single
I think for a start b35am mcpcb would be cool, what ff
Yeah that's true
thats a freeman design?
im down
with boost ‚ù§Ô∏è
anduril m3-c ü§®
with permission
id give em out for free
maybe i could get some freeman drivers made
are there any fun DIY pcbs that i can have jlcpcb populate for me
true, since id be manually panelling i could do anything
maybe ill get 3535 ts10 dtp
oh sick
i doubt thatd be in the 100 gbp range
we can have lots of pcbs
i have a lot of friends
if theres a lot of people interested in a certain pcb ill apply to have it made
ooh true
Free mcpcb üòàüòà
Solder new ones?
What's the hard part
Ive done single LEDs super ez
No need to laugh bruh
Can't be too hard to do a reflow on 3 LEDs on a bare board
Super cheap to DIY
They're on KD for 2.50
If you're suuuper patient then in December I'll be seeing some German friends üòÇ
My brother will be visiting soon, how is it shipping from the UK
Yeah
is there much point?
i imagine itd flex when heating
lemme google
dang
or is it true piss
visually is it like a bad amber?
i want proper yellow
is there any LED around 570nm
i bought this pack
its the coonvoy s2+ iirc
Id still consider anything more than passive to be a bit fancy
Oh true
UHP needs lots of cooling
Could mount with heat pipes and use them to cool the mcpcb
Nothing wrong with that
Can you do a reflex setup?
Good to know, I wasn't sure if it was any good
20w out
Just mentioning, still have a boost l21a with 9090 Ying Feng
Well
I might 3d print something
Gotta go either between the glass and bezel or glass and reflector
What can I use as a spacer
What do you do if you've assembled a light and theres a small gap between the reflector and bezel
anyways, doubled the tube o rings since this is a urbex light
nvm
ill just double up
ive got a second o ring now so it doesnt matter
eh
yeah i tried both, one didnt seem to seal and the other wouldnt sit in the groove
the head one being the one not touching the glass. and bigger as in thicker or bigger diameter
ive mixed mine up
on the convoy m1
of the o ring in the bezel and the oring on the head, which is which?
hm
Baked a blem M1, it looks black under dim light and deep reddish purple in intense high CRI light
How is it
I'm sticking a sft40 5000K and a 8A buck into my M1 for my brother
I prefer the Thor 3 type finish which feels very matte
Yeah I don't really like the shiny smooth feel
But the M1 is really polished feeling
It's hard to explain
My usual convoys have a slightly shiny matte finish
Yeah
My M1 feels really plasticky
I'll probably bake my M1 as well but I want to do a gradient
Fubky
Baked?
Can you solder a mini PCB onto the PCB
O I forgo how PCBs work for a minute
Millmax looks good then no?
Fair, and it can't be solder
Most jst and do 2 in parallel?
Yeah buck it is
26 7135 üò≠
I'm 5050 on wether I reflash the stock linear driver or get a 8A buck
How much current should I give a sft40 5000K if it's going in a M1
I'm def trying biscotti on my lights when I get home
good luck üò≠
its too late for me to figure this out
you have one tho
huhh
oh yeah you built the hex for it duhh
so presumably the mf04 will too
my mf01x has flashing pads
the plastic is like the q8 plastic
alum ring held down by screws, round plastic spacer
same as mf01x?
l21a fits a 22m convoy boost
Yeah the first more so
Darn looks like you got shipped the wrong colour
and well past the date
taobao
The CFT lights are sold pretty cheap on jlasers
thats so smart
the bottom half in mule-like
ooh reflector on the top
any LED will do
its for the s6, its not even a efficient driver so its probably not even that deep
if i cant find a LED im happy with ill just go 5000k 519a
yeah anything really
hm
ive never looked at anything low CRI, but. whats a good enough tint, low cri, high efficiency LED thats 3535
I'd be happy with that
And while double stacking wires in that tiny space, it's tough not to move them
The joints definitely could be better but from the photo that just looks like the wires moved while cooling
Is the piggyback just adding another fet?
They just need to match colour to colour
A worker doesn't need to know red positive from ground
A lot of manufacturers do that for ease of assembly at the factory
Oh gotcha
Can you explain the idea?
more likely hes a relative/ early investor
or
my bet is hes either sent free stuff to defend them
plus a nice wooden sleeve
i want this
It should be warmer
Amber isn't warm enough
Yup
50k from the resistors I blow up ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
I used to like you Luna üòìüòìüòì
SHUN THE NON BELIEVER
BOOOOOO
What's the others
i want even warmer light!
Maybe the effect was overstated
True but having some ability to see colour than absolutely no colour
I'll get a osramber c8 anyways
Tho I see a colour change on turbo Vs high ramp
Hm so other than cri is not that important to get pc
I found a c8 for 2gbp
I wanna make a osramber c8 host
I still need a PC amber then
Hm
/s.
Cause it's got a cri of 0
Isn't the xpe mono?
Is the osramber PC or mono
whats the benefit over a 1634 for example
oh yeah duh
using a common ground you could use the aux on the +ve wire to act like a button press right?
maybe could go via the aux to activate sounds
i landed on a dfplayer mini for a smallish project with sound
<@410163261137223704> size limit?
ofc not
nvm that was really stupid
its arduino right?
why not
kerts messages üò≠
guppydrv fw flashed
calm down luna
sitrel needs something quick
mtg2 too
just to test fet drivers
grab one for testing
look at the sale section, xhp50 for 4 usd or something
ahhh
really? i swear ts11 is FET?
why multiple
me neitherüòÉ
resistor?
yeah sub in anything thatll show you activity e.g ammeter and use it to go through menus
I need some more cool emitter love
It looks plain white to me üòÇ
My eyes are too used to warm light
Check beamshots I'm about to label what's what
Not pc
Amber
Nah xpe2
But oh well
Can't lie I should really be using a heated plate
But it won't light up in diode test mode
I tried doing a ts11
I think I fucked up a reflow
I do have a lh351d, it glows lime under UV üòÇ
Ooh also just got the ssq60 ns59, it's def a winner over the xhp50. Cleaner beam and tint and a slightly throwier profile makes it a killer combo
But I mean coloured pc
So I do have some pc LED
Hahaha alright
I still have no pc LEDs then üò≠
Is what it is
Rip
Yeah <@544931397048205312> it looks monochrome
I swear I asked here and someone gave me that link for a pc amber
Aw darn what's the difference
Now I can reflow I can swap a 3000K sft40 into my ts11 and I can reflow LEDs from the silver ingot store which means cheaper modding üòé
I'm so stoked
I'll beamshot in a sec
This fella
Pc amber I think
Just did my first reflow and I'm AC so stoked, put a xp e2 amber into a sp10 v3 (meant to get the pro cause I love anduril and I like a good moonlight but oh well) overall I really like this amber colour but at turbo it becomes more orange and is Def overdriven
250?
whats a good reflow temp
time to practice the swap
they look the same to me
meant to get 16mm
i got a 10mm amber xpe by accident
is the lh351d the same footprint as xpe
i do, im just no good
sooo
thatd require dissasembly and so far ive got a track record of leaving long deep scratches around the body when i take them apart
ooh yeah
if i do a soldered button on my hammered copper ts10 then ill get a wheel
yeah, i dont have tho, i might buy but its probably not worth it
and i used vinegar and salt to remove some brass oxidation which dulled it
its leaded but the brasso polish dulled it pretty fast
I've gotta get to the switch cause I think I got some dust in there as its not reacting to touches
I definitely like the head but I worry about degrading the components when soldering to it
The body had some tiny indents which j tried filling with solder but it just doesn't look great
The tailcap would've been better if I'd just sanded it smooth I think the solder detracts from the look
The switch is definitely a favourite to me since it's so nice and smooth and still looks interesting
If I hadn't fucked up the body so much before I think it would be a lot betyer
Overall opinion of the smooth ts10
what driver sjhould i swap into a maeerxu df02
2x small plates?
nono sft40
ive got 6, want one?
true
eh ill just go for 2700k then if no one else is in
anyone wanna do a group buy??
like multiple pcb?
cause if they have coloured options, 4x pink and the rest 5000K
are the cw higher output
could be worse
saves on shipping
might be able to bundle a USA order in with it as i fly there soon
any chance youd reflow for me
fire, ill hit you up next week or so
i have a lot of sft40 3000k on the way, might stick one in there + warm flood
uk?
also
<@410163261137223704> looking to sell some?
and it flows on
i just apply lots of flux
really?
In a mostly delusional sense. I could do that üòé
That makes more sense
I wonder how Simon does larger relfectors, milling away the whole block and then coating that milled alum seems silly
And at larger sizes, the defects wouldn't really matter
Especially if I go the casting route
So in theory, if I 3d printed a parabolic reflector in plastic and then sanded and polished it, coated it with a smooth ceramic coat or cast it in aluminium then used PVD or sputtering to coat it in aluminium. I could create any size reflector I want
Go on
Short protection?
And maybe a yellow sp10 pro
And imma get a amber cslnm and green too while I'm at it and find a light for them probably
S21d quad pc amber or sp10 pro
A large oblong reflector would maybe make it okay
poor mans wuben x1
theyre ezpz to desolder and resolder
yup
why cant it be reflowed?
damn maybe i should actually get a hank
like neopixel style where each is individuaally controlled??
like a "chase" pattern
yeah
reflector aux are pretty sick either way
im not picky on implementation
but its pretty useless
cause itd be awesome to have a rotating colour pattern
idkif its possible but can you have each aux be individually controllable
Ah gotcha, missed the gnd Vs gnd1
im probably reading that wrong but is there only one channel of gnd and vcc input pad
and see if i can salvage the old boost driver
time to fix the l21a UV
pinecil finally arrived
So just mega efficient fet driver
So in dumb terms it's like a mega efficient and cheap fet driver
So your batteries need to output a lot of power
It doesn't make power out of air tho right
That is exciting
Ooohh
I don't know enough about electrics to have any real input
I kinda get it
What's the benefit of that Vs buying a buck driver
i cant find them online anywhere
Better do it right
Okay
More parts to buy
Ugh man
I'm about to solder the legs for the first time
<@551463315919077391> any chance the bulb legs will arc without insulation
i didnt read that right
oh darn
yeah ive got a spare 12v meanwell, it does boost too right?
also, 
should be fine right
yeah its the one imma buy
It's cheaper to just buy a new one
Yeah I'm not knowledgeable enough to do it without you being really involved and that's a lot of effort
And I didn't properly photograph it before fiddling
This mystery driver is a big pain
Can't lie, might just buy another driver
except mines 2x the voltage
a lot of the pcb layout is different
but mines black
this should be it
idk, i wasnt used originally i dont think but im really not sure
okay to make sure ive got it
first imma check continuity between the LED negative (the unsoldered to contact in that pic^) to the blue and yellow points
not good pic?
Lmk if this is good enough
can i go get the driver and have you annotate a photo of it
which resistor to the left did you mean?
okay, ive got some free time again
Sorry it kinda confused me and I was hoping it was just a soldering error
I'm knacked and imma sleep
No, is it okay if I get back to you in 24hrs
I don't know what's gone wrong
I've given up
Yeah
Getting a new driver
I'm throwing in the towel
Still no output
Nothing
I've done a clean job
But I know the old ones had gotten pretty hot
No i used a 47mohm
Nada
Trying it with a new fresh resistor on the gtfc40 just to try get it working
Okay so
Huh
What else can I do
Idk
What if these ones now are knackered
And use 3 new ones
I'm gonna try remove the resistors in there now
Fair
Yeah
Idk what to do on the driver now üò≠
Yeah with a 9v check
Ugh
It's Def my driver
Okay no there's still continuity across it
What if my led is fucked
Didn't work
Oh no
Insult it
Go on
Yeah
This is awful
I know
Yeahh
Ig I had the wrong one
So I just leave it at one extreme
It has no temps on it
The knob has been reversed
Please
Wish me luck
Brb
Okay üëå
Can I just connect everything via the remaining sense resistor pad
Did the pad I removed matter
In theory
So
YeH
So it'd be tinned if it were ever soldered too
I can't properly remove solder
Yeah the blob didn't touch thay
Will it have continuity to the outside negative ring
Hang on
Hm
The OG driver was never soldered there
How do I know what point to solder too
But
I've probed
Sooo
Does this help
I can circle the survived trace part
Fair
And what's that pad next to the OG position
There's a teeeny trace it looks like thats lifted and survived
Ignore the funny tint, it's the only optical lense I've got nearby
Here's what I'm dealing with
<@410163261137223704>
Oh dear
It melted off
How do I figure it out
One sec
Yeah it's not ac connected
So should I tear off this pad now
How do I fix
For now
It's in the mail üò≠üò≠
It's a LESI light emitting soldering iron
So
My iron is mega crap
I resoldered it maybe 10 times
But it's pretty close
It's not shorted
The pad that the sense resistor and the LED negative go to has come off
Which one
Please help
<@410163261137223704>
What do I do
Tore a pad
Fuckkk
When I get home üòÄ
I really need the pinecio
Yeah my iron is glowing red hot
Might have to chat to simon
Guh üíÄ
I'll work it out later
Oh dear
Nah I'm pretty sure I scraped that off last night
I think I've shorted the sense resistor to ground
Not a crack tho
Oh there's potting compound on there
It's not cracked
When I'm home after school I'll do some proper diagnostics
No voltage across the LED
The l21a no longer turns on
Oh dear
Brain not braining
Yeah I see that now
Brains been foggy recently
Ugh
Oh wait I mean driver
Whoopsie
Is it important to sand it off?
its just alcohol but my flash makes it look weird
or leave it open?
do normal glasses work?
woops
either way
idk its more of a headache
my eyes hurt
glued in over the 9 open air dies
its a quartz dome
<@410163261137223704> i was right
is it 50% duty cycle or 50% current
if i use the mode group on the convoy driver that has a max 75% do you think the LED will survive
Ugh that's a expensive tool
And the l21b
And the c8
Same for the s21d
The S2 was miles easirr
I really really don't think it's a torque issue
No I'm telling you it's deformed in the direction of un screwing
It's visibly deformed
Then it's a design issue
If the metals deforming and it's still a torque thing
Maybe a drop of acetone
I think it's a glue issue or something
I don't think it's a torque issue
The holes are slightly oval shaped
I can't push any harder
Bro it's not gonna help
Both sides now üò≠
When can I start the mod
I've done the sacrifice üò≠
Cut üëç
It's that I'm pushing so hard it's cutting into my hand and the bezel won't move
It's not that these bend when I turn it
It is
Nah I trimmed the bendy bit
It works on every other bezel
Using this
No camera lense tool
The bezel came off ez
Long day
Meant retaining ring
Ah shizzle
And still no movement
This l21a just won't move, ccw and heat
I've done a S2 ez pz
Maybe they're tough
Hm
Have you removed a l21a bezel
Is the sense resistor on the front
Shortened so they fit more snuggly
I'm using a modified pair of tweezers
Nothing
Fuckim hell
Lemme heat
Ughhh
Right?
Ccw
Can't get the driver out
Damn l21a retainer ring stuck too
I'll go ahead with the dome and message some manufacturers later
Which inclines me to think I could pop the glass off as it wouldn't be poured, it's probably glued into a small ring
Optically imma say glass
This is like glass
Polycarb is still easy to scratch
Throw
I want more thrkw
Waaattt
Let alone slice it
I can't scratch ir
Wtf the dome is hard as hell
If the spec sheet says 2A would 2.35 be safe
Aight
Ah yeah there's separate dies with bond wires
So what's the difference dedome Vs slice
Okay
Man you recommended I dedome it in the first place
The 9 die yingfeng I got from sakowuf
So I can run higher current through this
No I'm trying to remove the dome
Hm?
<@544931397048205312> reckon I can cut at this metal edge
The ying Feng 9 die
Tonight I assemble the UV l21a
Reckon solvent dedome would work
Until I get close
I'll just go in 1mm increment
True
But if I look at it from the side it kinda looks like a TIR where you can't see the LEDs
Ah all their listings say PC, I wouldn't trust it
Also, how do I figure out the cutting depth
This is very solid
The dome feels pretty solid Vs a sst40 dome which is kinda squishy
Led acquired
<@544931397048205312>
shame
ah that makes sense
Both my 3000k ts10 measure 0.0035 DUV  and 95+ Ra
That r9 üíÄüíÄüíÄ
It's so green
Mf01x top Vs bottom ramp üòÇüòÇ
‚ù§Ô∏è
And it'll make potting easier too
I think I'll do that
I reckon it's better than using screw terminals
Cause then I can pot the whole board and it'll be safer
Would soldering the wires be a smarter idea
Resins just fot the rest of it
I assume so
Like within the screw terminal, should it stay out of the resin?
Like inside the screw terminal
Do I want the wires potted too or aare they excluded
And make sure wires are crimped
So tldr. Vertical resistor, let the cap stick out, pot it and get 2A fuse
üëç
Cool
180W bulb plus 0.5W air pump
Ah that's fair, could even do 1a, I shouldn't be going over that
Is*
3a KS what I need right?
So all good üòé
The plug imma use at the wall has a fuse
Other than just in the power plug
Sure, where in the circuit would I add
Cool, I'll take a look around see what's good, but tldr I can stick the cap half in and pot everything
Or does it need to be thermally conductive
If the UV resin for 3d printing works I'll just pot it with that cause it's mega cheap
But it stick outs far
The legs have a small taper so the lower half fit
The legs don't fit
Nah but it will be inside a backpack
I assume the issue with havjng it not flush is it might snap off
And just leave the cap not flush
Shits tough
Aghh
Cool imma print a case then üëç
Like space around and above
Are there any clearances I should be aware of for when cap
chuck all this into a printed shell
like size isnt a issue
i can just put wires to the capacitor
ill watch some vids on point to point
im off to bed but ive got ages tmrw to figure it out
i can try point to point i suppose
cant really bend it that easily?
now to figure out how to do the cap
idk why that didnt occur to me
gotcha
ez pz
ohh
can you do a rought drawing
ive done a few mods before and stuff, but this is my first custom
i think its going where the little capacitor was in parralel to the cap
of the resistor?
soooo
large cap wont sit flush on the board even if i bend the pins a little
so my plan is vertical resistor where the little cap is
kewl
nah no heart conditions in the fam afaik and ive been pretty spooked before
my finger gets burny but my heart is largely not zapped
very specifically, left hand pointer finger touches both legs of my large capacitor and its fully charged
pain aside, as long as its not left hand to right hand im mostly chillin?
gotcha, just wasnt sure of the geometry
also, lets say i fuck up and touch a capacitor leg with my fingertip. do i die? itll go right across my finger right>
vertically?
especially when im testing or if it goes wrong
eh best safe than sorry tho?
where should i sodler it to
so i think best safe than sorry
yeah it does
and since the new cap doesnt quite fit into the old capacitors two holes, i can bend the legs a little? or is there a better way to fit it
but hang on, lemme check if ive got this right. remove both caps, replace with large one. put resistor into the unpopulated resistor hole as it appears to be in parralel to the capacitor
so my parachute doesnt have many holes, should i add more?
nah its cool, i appreciate im hopping into the deep end and im not quite sure how a lot of this works
thats why i work outdoors üòé
me neither
why?
but its one on the positive and one on the negative
i thought the capacitor was like in series if that makes sense, both legs on the positive trace
i have made a crazy discovery
like a chicken breast
no wrinkles
my brain is smooot
from me üòé
so its gone
just remove it
guh
no?
where the small cap was
cool, so remove the cap and just short the two pads
100NF 100V BOX CAPACITOR
one sec
ooh the teeny weeny thing
the cap is 25v 3300uf and the bridge is 
well ive got the replacement cap
Hey <@551463315919077391> what needs modification
a what?
i want out üíÄ
fuckin hell
but i gotta check with a multimeter
haha alread discharged it
<@551463315919077391> üò± this cap is humongous
would it be cheap enough for you to purchase from rs online and have someone stick it in a envelope for you
thats a shame
damn
time to wander into a university
ts10 driver?
rip
what light
I'll order that instead üëç
Thank you saltyboi
Ah awesome
sits arund the edges and the top
imma just 3d print a gaskey
but idk if the bezel is wide enouh to hold it
i can 3d print a ring or buy a pring to add some diameter if it needs and add a thicker oring for thickness
so this likely wont fit
<@410163261137223704> do you know the dimensions iof the m3c glass and mcpcb
missed that]
ahhh
aliexpress.com/item/1005004086415255.html
aliexpress.com/item/1005004227798390.html
aliexpress.com/item/1005003090918373.html
2.64 + 3.32 + 29.24 = 35.2
buying m3c with battery inside and extension pre installed costs more than 26650 m3c + extension + battery
hm
eh no point then
ill leave it for now
idk tho
im also looking at the 3v xhp50 for my sc31 pro]
i really like that purple
is the l6/7 threading different]
a while ago i found a directory of all their special LEDs and there was some nutty stuff
could always try that massive uvc seoul LED
op right? since its multi die
smo or op reflector for this
also
cool
alsi id worry about the bond wires if i dd
oh would the dome make it more likely to break
moar powaa
ehhh im sure its fine
oops caps
CONVOY M3 RIGHT?
1,5 A
says 12v
this fella
it has room for a boost driver (i think thats what you need for a uv led or is it buck)
tbh id prefer a pill just to make my life easy but if i have to a shelf is okay
maybe the s11
im chill with either anduril or a convoy style driver
im thinking maybe a d1k but idk if it would drive the uv led well enough
so, whats a cheap host with a lot of thermal mass that i could fit a 9090 UV LED into
That's a shame
Dang
Would sofirn not sell direct to you
True that
ooh thats like the sft40 3000k ts10 that someone posted today
how come the convoy is inferior
id buy a jaxman if it meant getting to say i have a diy wavien
awesome, if you figure it out ill definitely be copying you
whereas wavien would go dircetly back
oh okay it would just spray light back in the general direction of the LED
would retroreflective tape not just be a poor mans wavien
itd be less precise than one of those parabolic mirror things that increase intensity
and you could construct a loose dome over the LED the same retroreflective tape
since it reflects back to the source
would using a retroreflective tape around the inside of a z1 help intesity
just a thought
but im upgrading soon
im still working with a crap one
its good to have a better one but at the end of the day it doesnt really matter
shoulda got 20mm
i got the 16mm KD
i think i got the wrong size mcpcb for the sc31 pro
bruhh
There head probably has a lip and the reflector only comes out fully from the driver side
I didn't buy just yet, but I'll probably either do a DIY PCB kit or get one of the semi 3d printed ones off ali
But its pretty crap
I managed a cheap reflow using a soldering iron straight onto the mcpcb and a lotttt of flux
I should probably do it right
If I'm doing it for someone else
Well
I'm learning to emmiter swap soon, once my hotplate arrives
Cause I wanna moddd
Let me know
If that all works
Ooh
Does it fit under the stock bezel?
yup
cause thats easy af to diy
blue swirl with plain TI?
i didnt like the plain grey look
fair
i know theres a couple mistakes on there
good or bad
and its not paint so its still got that ti feel in hand
its more vibrant irl
<@544931397048205312>  <@140540414154375168>  yall have a titanium ts10 right?
nuh uh
on ti?
HANG ON JUST DRYING IT OFF
YOURE GONNA LOVE THE TITANIUM
IF YALL WERE IMPRESSED BY THE BRASS
HOLY SHIT
üò≠
why would anyone want that
oh ewww
for lights with a lcd?
me but thermal paste
am i doing right?
i use my nose to apply the paste
but i did fix the button back there, so i mustve dissassembled it from the back
wait maybe i did do it from the back, i honestly cant remeber
just pull it out from the front]
nop
i used a 3d printed spacer inside the tube (removed the inner tube) to help prevent deformation but you can leave everything else in
just start on the tailcap and you'll find a good rhythm, at first i hit too softly and thought it was multiple hits that made up each dent which looked terrible. but i just covered up the first few bad hits later on with a big hit
and you can return it the day after
yeah i wont be properly in the US for a while, but the ball peen cost ~¬£5
ah oops
haha youre UK right?
im picking up brasso today to finish polishing it
and just made sure to constantly rotate it as to make sure i didnt deform the tube
i had to hit the torch a LOT harder than i thought i would
it should make a smoother surface
yup, 4 oz/ 110g. i rounded it off a little since it wasnt super smooth but a jewelers ball peen is much more rounded
that way i dont accidently hit the switch and destroy it
nah i left it un touched, if i do that section ill try rounding out my center punch and use a second hammer
but i cant think of how to do it best
imma 3d print a jig to hold it in the drill
i think ill try spinning it in a drill, and if it doesnt work go to a professional
now to figure out polishing
just finished hammering my braTS10
otherwise your hand is fine
use the rubber sole of a shoe to help hrip thst bezel if you really need
just warm it to soften glue
eek no
so use a hairdryer to heat it if it wont come off
might be a smidge of glue
unscrew the bezel at the front
yup thats the shelf
oh the shelf?
wdym?
True
but i wont be able to ship it in the US until i next visit mid oct
if you can take a pic of your driver from vertical i can try my hand
no payment
can i help
i have a GTA
the two leftest flashing pads
i would direct solder but its on the opposite side of the driver
aw thats a shame
How do you contact a ripped off pad
now to figure out how to make contact with the ripped pad
idk if they were brighter before tho tbf
yeh aux are mega dim still, thats a shame
yeh that and max ramp
7c to change brightness?
nah the aux are mega dim
Also is there a way to remove all flashes in the ramp, I don like getting flash blinded by 20k lumens
DW it was in simple ui
Also are you able to pre enter values for stuff likelockout 1h 2h
Haha
Drop SOS too if you want
so you can bin it
i e=never use tac mode
ITS DEF BRIGHTER
AND THE MOONLIGHT IS SOLID
IT FIZZLED AND POPPED
TFFF
THE AUX WORKS
NO FUCKING WAY
nop
ohh
and to change aux brightness
whats the button press to get to the strobes
i gotta figure out anduril two now
so the bottom of the ramp is really bright
Yeah
The whole thing gets hot a lot lot faster so I guess more current
Fw
And new fe
All that changed really was some minor current path stuff
Hang onnn
Yk
And that's what matters
Working
Eh I took those out manually
This was a win
So really
I always covered the aux anyways at night
Yk what
Lemme clean this up and get it screwed down
But everything else is
Not aux
LED WORKS
BOSH
Is that my pic?
To make the 3 lil wires easier to pull üò≠
There's no other shorts
IT WAS SHORTED ON PURPOSE BY ME
HOURS OF WORK
MY GIRLFRIEND IS LAUGHING AT ME üò≠üò≠
I AM EMOTIONALLY SCARRED
DONT OOF ME üò≠üò≠üò≠
All 3 together
üò≠
I screwed the batt in
Yuhhh
I didn't like them that much
I don't need aux anyways
THE SMOKE AND NOISE
AND I SCREWED IT BACK TOGETHER
TO MAKE IT EASY TO PULL THROUGH
I SOLDEERED 3 AUX WIRES TOGETHER
NOOOOO
<@551463315919077391>
NO
But the switch wires keep getting in the way and shiz
I have üò≠
I CAN'T PULL THESE TINY ASS WIRES
üò≠
In parralel
But I've added 4 16awg wires
Yeah the holes pretty big
its so tricky getting the wires through the shelf
doing the double weekend
part time lifeguard üíÄ
but in 8 hours ill return to finish
ive gotta go to work
bad news
imma re-assemble the light
all good <@551463315919077391>
avrdude -c usbasp -p t85 -u -Uflash:w:mf01x.hex  <@551463315919077391>
wait hang on whats the cmd
IM GOING!!!
<@140540414154375168> thank you so much! But multichannel?
üò≠
<@544931397048205312> wanna help me figure out making my own anduril build
id buy anything if i could have a use for it
i gotta find something tat costs 5 dollars to get free shipping
agh its in the description
http://kaidomain.com/SFQ43-4x-Core-3V-12A-3000-Lumens-SMD-3535-LED?search=sfq
how do i select the warm white version of this LED
is a copper pcb worth it
such a pretty host
aghh damn
oops cap
WOULD A T2 REFLECTOR WORK?
damn
lets get a pretty pink stainless steel light üòé
alright
and put a second pink LED into the alum s2+
ill just select the 50% max group
even for a low power pink LED?
but pretty in pink
putting it into this host
also should be okay to sand 1mm off the driver diameter
aliexpress.com/item/1005005773678347.html
aliexpress.com/item/4000127131542.html?mp=1
these two should be okay together right? its 2A over the spec but id rather a buck driver over a linear
heyyy <@140540414154375168> pleeeassse help me build the anduril
Which pin is MO and RS on the t85
All my homies solder direct to IC
Fuck solder pads
Ripped
I came back over night
Nothing üíÄ
Two solder pads ripped
Big issue
Uh oh
I haven't been able to read everything yet
Did the anduril build end up dropping
Hey just got back home
Thank you!
man theres so many options it hurts my head
ah okay
oh true, we'll see
are they e21a size
this fella
imma make a mule
ive asked how many of those ambers they can cram in parralel onto one board
so many odd LEDs
i love this alix store
honestly i kinda want a LED no one else has
or this lil dude
<@544931397048205312> how about this PC amber
imma sleep soon
ooh thats okay
<@140540414154375168> pretty pretty pretty please
itd be sick in a z1
wait fr
whats so great about the pc amber
okay i dont want a house fire
but i gotta wait til after the award ceremony and shiz
i got a scholarship thingy and theyre offering to pay for better tools
gotta wait tho
plus 10 amber leds, nothing to do with them
no reflow
i cant
oh man
pink it is then
oh?
pink, yellow
im getting some better tools soon, then ill do it
maybe in the future
eek
who sells it on alix
blf post says 1500k
ooh so its mega warm
ooh whats the PC part mean
i can do uvc for the feeling of sand in your eye
ah light sand
i was thinking fun colours, like pink/cyan/piss etc
grey?
also more questions what colour xpe to stick in my s2+
ah cool
yall are magic
and the front aux will still show voltage
and the switch and front aux will still work?
the dive light?
mo goes to the big one
pin 3 goes to the small fet near the usb port
pin 7 is aux
thats it
ah yeah
nop
this fella is the switch, labeled k
the swith is a e switch with a lot of LEDs so which part of it do i poke
lemme probe
phattt
oof its 20kb
ooh okay
avrdude -c usbasp -p t85 -U flash:i:backup but i.hex:i
want me to do :i
theres no i in the name?
same cmd?
andshould i unplug the usbasp
how do i do that
so uh
üò¢
so now what
TWSS
now to get new fw
rah
ü´∂
<@544931397048205312> you ma fave
love ya <@551463315919077391>
it worked
AliExpress goop
These are the most ASS joints I've made
The flux is getting to me
IF GOD WAS A LOVING CREATOR THEY WOULDVE MADE THESE BULLSHIT PADS BIGGER
Plus
It's finere
Ehhh
It filled with solder before it wanted to stick to the spring
With a solid wire on there
Also the springs no longer very springy
What about the other two
I did the piddly one
Should I bother with spring bypassing all the tail springs
You Vs the 2 guys she tells you not to worry about
But I could always part ways with it for a decent price, not now though. Maybe a futur thing
I like this lil guy
Haha no
Germany, Canada, Switzerland and Netherlands iirc
I'm seeing my EU friends in a months
But I travel to the USA all the time
Is this actually sought after?
UK
About to stick it in now
want my mf01x?
sucks to be them (its gonne be me again üò≠ )
its no prob
imma just solder
eh i dont have pogo pins unfortanutely
lemme go get soldering
yeah
ü§° <- me rn fr
oh man i thought you guys knew about those and that there was an issue with them
okay hang on brb
yeah
this shit sucks
IDK MAN
ONE FUCKING PIN EVERY TIMNE
just ass at this
no just cant get all 8 lined up
ye theyre flashing pads
i cant get all 8 contacts on <@544931397048205312>
fucking hell
at this point solder would be easier
lemme get some better light
i think im just bad at aligning it
the other half make 0 contact üò≠
half the pins are depressed
ive just realised
i reckon im just bad at clipping
dw double checked both pinout and wire integrity with the multimeter
lemme check my plug
still no connection
ah
avrdude -c usbasp -p t85 -U flash:r:backup.hex:r
avrdude -p t85 -c usbasp -n
bosh
does the t85 need power? or will the clip provide it
ah back to getting that off the torch
just all in
unregulated, 0 pwm
when i turbo my mf01x, will it be directly connecting the 3x p45b to my 18 LEDs
also in a minor debate
im back üòé
but il redo my wires after
i gotta run for a hour
yeah thats what i thought too, tried re seating and still nada
if it works it works
just installed it to a diff drive at the root
fixed
nvm
avrdude acting up tho
nah its cool, plugged in to usb and no smoke
bosh
what direction should i be looking at thwe usbasp from, usb pointing to or away from me
but it dont fit the usbasp, thats where my male to female dupont jumper cables come in
2x4
its a straight shot from clip to plug, idk what the clip pins mean tho
i gotta figure out how to plug in the clip first
also
okay
i cant find it sorry
there is a mf01s hex on tk's site
Okay so i have all the programs installed to flash it, realised i dont have the right hex to get my mf01x onto anduril 2
quick q, obviosly the clips orientation vs the tiny85  matters but how do i know what way
haha ty android autoreply üòé
<@140540414154375168> hey would you help me reflash the mf01x
the mosfets in my mf01x to something higher power
which specs are important to match
I'm getting 660nm and 365nm already to put in a m21b or a s11
I should get a piss LED too
Ooh
üëçüèª
Not a super high priority order
I'm down to order whenever
Shipping is more expensive than the LEDS I nees
Anyone interested in a UK or USA yingfeng group buy
So what'd you have a issue with
Ohhh
So the hole for a TIR alignment pin wouldn't work
Ooh
I wanna get one of those 9 die UV LEDs like sakowuf has
In the time it took for my train to get above ground they sold out
I hope they sort something soon
Already out of stock üò≠
<@1015942407130447943> what company
1lumen reviews aerw good
I kinda want to do that too
until 18
for 2 years
you study 3-4 classes
college for us is also called 6th form
funny
college and then university
after seondary?
UK
turning 17 this year
nah secondary school
me?
i may just set the convoy driver to max at 50%
shipping thoo
i gotta get that zwb2 lens and a 1206 500 mW 3 mOhms SMD Resistor
rip üíÄ
what shop?
not sure really
for the convoy s11
could someone help me source a 28.7x1.8mm zwb2 filter
Or get a link cleaner extension for your browser
Just remember to remove everything after the .html
idk how the x75 driver presents its output, but i wonder if you could make a new mcpcb with jlcpcb that splits the output over two LED to give each 3v
is it 6v the x75
are you looking for DUV or CRI
ah me neither, i cant remember
earent they stupid high output and available in warm colours
what about those sfq 50 emiters
a sc31 pro when strobing + magnetic tailcap
e.g
surely noise is from components with AC and a metal part
It'll probably be a inductor
Then glue tf out of ut
Open it up and hold down components with a eraser until the whine stops
Mine wasnt glued but I heard using a soft rubber sole helps for grip
what should i use to clean the z1 lens
do you have a large sheet of paper?
so the uv hotspots prolly a little larger
it only blocks visible light right
gim
thats the spill?????????????
jesus
went from barely light to fucking blasting
and down at the white spool at the bottom
look at that orange
fuuuucken hell
got a pic of it outdoors/ the sunburn
wanna beat my LEP
ill probably get one of those and try build a proper mega thrower
but mandatory full goggles and gloves
i want one
whuuut üò≠
host, driver, everything
also, how much did that total thing cost
looking for a flashin target is easier than a faint glow far away
id imagine if youre outdoors itd be better
whatd you do
the whole pill is the screw
`The pill gets screwed into the host`
and thw threads dont provide much contact (and you cant add thermal paste unless its conductive)
the holes not *that* big
yeh
A pill is a separate piece of metal, usually brass, that holds the LED (on an MCPCB) and the driver. The pill gets screwed into the host. Most modern hosts have shelves built into them, which are thick walls of the host‚Äòs material that the MCPCB sits on (with some thermal paste). The shelf is one part with the host‚Äòs head, meaning heat transfer is usually better with these.
Urs
What's the aim of uts
Dawg same
I'll be copy pasting someone elses DIY anduril and moving it to a different board then buying via jlcpcb
I'm thinking a flick switch for on/off and a e switch for modes. With RGB LEDs with a slide in diffuser. Most of it should be easy enough to diy
If I'm gonna DIY I may as well DIY right
Awesome, I know some firmwares have checks for different features or are reliant on certain flags
Or even what MCU is easiest to flash anduril into
Or is there a completely DIY light with anduril that I could read the build thread for
Like has anyone rebuilt a light to run on anduril, specifically very small ones
How custom can you get with anduril
Could it be a nextorch in-house/ custom thing
Yeah I tried some googling
Cool cool
Like it can only do this UI and nothing else?
Do they make dedicated chips for this kinda stuff
Any clue what it would be
Shizzle
Awh
Do you know?
Is it just arduino
Hm
Plus I'm in a school setting so it's pretty controlled
I daily carry a sc31 pro and it's never turned on by accident
So it won't get held
Imma mostly keep it in a blazer pocket with nothing else in
How come
Otherwise hold and clicking but with white first is good
Only one click on I want is for the night vision red
Yeah
My new UI?
Would the current MCU not be reflashable
I can share internals pics if it helps
Primary switch hold for on then clicks change between all LED at full power including blue, secondary switch turns on red LED with a single click
I've got something pretty simple in mind
I hate the current UI
Anyone know if it's possible to change the nextorch k40s firmware
I think
Ntc suggests a thermistor
What's a equivalent reflector get
welp if you're uk i can print a small PLA glow in the dark ring
cause i can 3d print a small cosmetic one but it wont be watertight
or just cosmetic
for waterproofing?
and bezel
lens
And desoldered the mcpcb
And then I just unscrewed the bronze ring
Ah the lens unscrews
<@458297028028399626>
yup, gimme a sec
took some cheep LED and scraped off the phosphor
yup
It's pretty nice, I can't wait for dark
So slapped a huge aqua blue die in there
Tried dedoming it's green LED but managed to break a teeeeny wire on the diode
Just emitter swapped a old zoomie
im hoping to get a filament extruder and resell some spools for cheap to get back the cost
true true
ouch
if you  buy a pellet extruder you can a kilo for less than 10
so 40 a month if youre a heavy user
yeah and filament is probably 20 or so per kilo
otherwise square pvc pipe or square aluminium
microcenter has 99 dollar ender 3s
USA?
You know much about 3d printing?
<@166235904933888000> finished some dubious soldering, how do I feed the driver wires back to the leds
<@701119955676037171> is it in the last pic
Wheres the fet channel, the one on this torch is broken
Made progress
All right
If it doesn't work I'll try
imma use a hairdryer on it
sould i be whacking it really hard?
out it comes
cool
<@137363644932423680>
There's no clear way to remove it
What do I do about the switch
<@166235904933888000> I've got the LED desoldered
cheers
2 isnt the limit per hole
ah right duh
ah so 4 total
cool, we talking  about the center hole right? or the 2 small ones with black in the center?
desolder still? or just bash
I'm happy to try anything to fix if
The fet channel is broken. So the torch is useless
How do I get this guy apart
Are you in FL?
Next weekend?
otherwise
cause i leave tmrw
from the US
if you're veeery quick i can ship a ABS  one to you tmrw
30x30x30cm is my maximum
yeah case can be any size
but itd need to be printed and designed in ~5hrs
<@383051269214044172> i can maaaybe ship it tmrw
then some 3d printed strain releif
magnets sit inside the case, wire wrapped around, electronics inside the case
this kinda thing
one sec
itd work on any battery and be much smaller
you may be in luck
i reckon a magnet system and 3d printed strain relief would be much better
USA?
<@383051269214044172>  you got a 3d printer? if not are you in the UK?
what about somthing akin to digital vernier calipers
Tho maybe potentiometer don't need it
The waterproof would be the hardest part tbh
HM, forgot about that, but doing it yourself would be easy enough
<@137363644932423680> surely you just want a slide potentiometer thats waterproofed
whatd you do
Mate
Sheesh
If youve  got time and answers I'd love to talk to you <@431846725007835136>
what type of lense do i need
potentially might build a LEP
its thermal glue iirc
And you'd need a support behind the extender to hold its shape
Dunno if the flashlight would close all the way
You might be able to buy a sheet of copper and using a handsaw cut a extender ring for the pad
Although the tube may not make contact <@754842238676238406> would that be a issue
I don't know the electronic side but 86 sounds like you could just 3d print a washer
well thats a lot cheaper than i thought it'd be
I got the blue LED btw
Just finished the swap. Worked great. Although a little disappointed in the brightness but it'll suffice
although one switch pcb is red the other green
are the pcbs identical, can i put one lighted switch in each light
theres two lighted switches
the end cap is compatible with the s21D
just got my lighted switch for l21b in the mail
honestly, thats what i thought. played a hour aqnd didnt like it. revisited and so far im really loving it
Video quality is a little worse and you can easily see the artifacts but when youre getting jump scared by headcrabs you don't really start pixel peeping
I prefer airlink though. I can play across my entire house without much bother
USBC optical cable
It is just USBC to USBC though. Nothing fancy really
Yup. It's in my bedroom right now
Hence the confusion
The quest 1 shipped with a 3m optical cable
I got a set of two bathroom tiles spare from a neighbor. It's heatproof, doesn't stay got for very long and is very chemical resistant
Incredibly easy in my experience. Hand drill and a tiny vice is what I used. A little oil didn't hurt when I tried
i dont see anything wrong with it, but you guys are the pros
ill be changing the wiring to be in parralel for longer run times and less current draw per battery
ah cool
Is there a measured increase in performance?
A couple CPAP fans can push air through that tube
aww
yo?
Oh mb
Looks like it says 18650 on the top of the bottom cell
ill still wait for v3 before getting a hank
hm fine
Are Hank gen 3s a actual thing or mostly logical speculation
Do you have a w50?
It must step down later but I've seen on the pine power it negotiates higher than 5v
Mf01x too, it charges at 12 or 19v iirc on c-c
ü´£
Want
Ohhh
I could quantum lock it to a magnet on my head üòé
Damn
Superconductor
Well
Imma get
Ooohho
Someday I'll get a sbt90 3x21d and maybe a 3x21e
The tailcap design looks awesome
Not bad
Listing says 12k lumens of 519a
Ah
Bright flood? It's 9 LEDs?
Flooder?
What's the point of the 3x21e?
It Def is, you can see his hand through it
m neither
ive akready got a mono amber tho
ooh mono amber?
Time to try some crispy cool high cri
Maybe 6500k b35am
Oh well
Ehh
maybe
round die
ooh
what interesting LEDs are there, im unfamiliar with the different cslnm and lmp
the b35am would be nice
Green or orange V2 maybe
Ah okay, might add a second one
I just bought one with battery for 21gbp
20% off?
ive got an enclosure thats well sealed so when it opens up i get a really strong whiff of fumes
kinda minty and burny
sc31 pro button is nice
Ooh I've got a similar build but l21a 9 die Uv
Ooh
And it's slightly brighter at turbo
The V3 is boost and linear right?
Fire
So you want boost for 6/12v LEDs and buck+fet for any 3v led
Ah thank you
Is it the same lumex1 between those two brands
Maybe d4s
And then I'll buy more lights to populate
Sc31
L21b
Ts11
COME ON LETS GO
YAAAAAH GOT 6
i could do it but its a whileuntil i visit the USA again
country?
sick!!!
but
aw sick it says its unavailable to me
also, in a not rude way, why do you want a IR s2
whats that, i cant see it?
BUY BUY BUY BUY
what vf is the sbt90
ive daisy chained non adjustable ones before, iirc certain meanwell PSU have a dedicated contact for it
could you daisy chain PSU in parralel
I'm thinking, dephosphor and get a wall of blue. How much would you sell for? Or I'd emmiter swap
How much
Haha dam that was fast, 11m max
Hold that ts25, my brother's been looking for one so I'll suggest it to him
i think theres is the 7 pad version
L21B with culpm emitter, battery not included for roughly ¬£30+shipping, it has slightt visual damage to the anodizing on the front and back (2 marks total) I'm on holiday but will get photos when I'm back. UK based
WTB 3x becu hank springs
Can you buy it new to the USA?
I would consult Luna and sitrelenby
It's much less known / popular
yeah its really not too bad, flux helps too. i redid 4 lights with a soldering iron only and just balanced everything, just remeber to squish down the LED before it cools and to not add too much solder
get a multimeter with diode test mode and check polaritys and then youre done
thats fair üòÜ , you can get super cheap hot plates of aliexpress that run off usbc, you just need some flux and the new sft40 3000k (convoy flashlight sotre on aliexpress has them rn). you just plop down the plate, heat it up, lift off old LEDs with tweezers and put new ones on
or for the fun story, you can tell people " i know a guy in taiwan whos importing my rare flashlight, and this guy knows a guy in the UK whos carrying it on a flight here and that UK guy knows another guy whos gonna modify my light and then send it to me so i can play with cool tech üòé "
yup üòÖ  or kd
ah kaidomain has it
or skip the whole buy from taobao and see if nealgadgets has it or if its on aliexpress
üëç
from there you can just dissasemble the light, remove the mcpcb, ship it to a modder in a envelope and have it reflowed and then get it back and reassemble
and saltyboi has family in taiwan so you could try buy via taobao and then have it brought to the UK and internationally shipped to you - it may come out cheaper (or possibly id be able to carry it to the us ans ship domestically) depending on the time line
sakowuf, artie, mcbob and i think a few others are USA based, im sure someone else can chime in with more info
you can also try comission a modder to do it, what country are you in?
they might do, you could alternatively try yourself, it took my about 15m to figure it out using a soldering iron, a proepr hotplate would be even easier
for reference
iirc luna has one
np
jkk76
whoops, wrong model, hang on. jinheng have exactly what you want, a sft40 multi emitter soda can thats fairly cheap and you can put a sft3000k in ezpz. only downisde is UI
jkk70 maybe then?
Give it a couple days and I'll get back to you
Nor am I üòÇ
Ah that's fair
Rider Rx ti, sc31 pro with xpg4, possibly sc18
Would you trade?
I want but my wallet can't give
I'm really gonna have to think about it
It's the 18650 d1
Whyyy
25 dollars

It went oos while my train was underground

Ah now it did
Idk why but it didn't come through
Dang I ran the command for you right before I did mine
<@922924770041954365>  i gotchu
ha take that <@754842238676238406>
too wide, i considered trying to grind down a convoy one and seal it with epoxy but im pretty sure id have to grind away too much
The square convoy one? No, the rider rx uses a weird cylindrical switch
mb, meant omten, its in the discord history, id find it but im on mobile rn
youd probably need a small spacer as the forward clicky has a large nub
but the rider is easy enough to dissasemble
im sure some other brand has the same
but i cant get omron to send it to me
ive found two models of switch that i think are the forward and reverse clicky versions of what the rider has
#f0a8e9 maybe?
Might be worth buying for a custom, the cost is cost to that of a bare module
do oy uknow if it hasa driver
yumyumyum
link??
If possible id love to get/make one
Ooh I can't wIt
I really want that sbt90 3x21d with 1mcd
I'll deal with the fab, I need help with the design tho
<@544931397048205312> would you want to Collab on a high power anduril driver for the 3x21d, get 4 fets in parallel or sm
Gotcha
Is lt1s the best version?
Feel free to do everything I did, but you'd probably write it better
Nope üò≠
Yeah
This one
Is look for reverse clicky under my name
ü§∑
I'm out rn but if you do a search on discord you'll probably find the two models I wanted to test
I couldn't find it
If anyone knows how to get it ü•πü•π
Just can't get omron to give me what I need üò≠
It's a easy disassembly
Should just be a switch swap
Personally I'm after a 14500 2s, that could be a nice novelty
Gah I'm working on it, can't get omron to give it to me
In one pocket
I've been double edcing recently, sc31 pro sft40 3000k and rider Rx  ti 5000k DD 519a

AAAH
Ah
What's the better deals on here
Buy?
Pl47g2 ü§®
no sale on it tho so im passing
not sure sorry, id only buy one because i dont yet have a reylight
its a light made by reylight
Like what's something that every enthusiast should own
Ooh what's some of the really popular models
Same
aw what 209 is cheap???
i can never open those xx.us.xxx addresses
Ye
1lumen?
I got a wuben X3, nextorch k25 and a ns59v2
Lots of torches
Ooh that silver S2 looks good
C8 Vs c8+?
Not bad price for two quality lighte
The S6 will get a lh351d probably
Then resell
And a 8a buck
I'll stick a nice green in maybe
M1 otw
ive got a copper one already
imma sleep on that tube
hmm
got a link to that tuvbe
hmm
a blue ano would be sweet
idk about s21e tho
s6 is meant to be nice
welp
how do they compare to standard pricing?
Nevermind
It declined
May as well
Oooooh
But
Ooh
195 usd
ah meant the rot66 sorry üòÖ
its rawww
its not ano
id get it done profesionally tho
since no more scratches
i really think polishing mine would raise the value
raw
What condition
That's so much
Damn 150 for a rot66
6gbp for new ac
There's a 20350 if that's any better for you
What would you put into jt
i couldnt see ay seams around the switch
no i did dedome tho
It's a very smooth light so stripping and polishing would be easy peasy
idk what size switch it uses yet but ive got a lot of spare convoy switches
haha ill probably give it a crack tonight unless i figure out how to fix my 3d printe
fair, i wanna try mod it to reverse clicky
i tried the Ti, didnt like it vs my copper ts10 and its sat un used
thats fair
ah well
consider, the original version is 6500K and not high CRI, the ti uses a 519a 5000k
unscratched, most of the original package included
all the performance and all the looks
its a alum body with a TI shell?
dang
ill sell you mine
yup, rider rx ti 2.0 to be precise
with mine being larger
0.6cm difference in diameter
so theyre almost identical
about 15.5cm for mine, to the sharp hotspot cutoff
i wanna compare
can you measure the hotspot diameter from 30cm away
the rider rx 2.0 looks kinda similar
the sharp circular shaped beam?
But I am considering #2
I've had my Thor for about a year now I think so I won't complain about price drops
Yeah I think so
Just for 60% of the cost of a Thor 3 rn its easier to justify to a newb

Even less

Bottom right
Lmao
yeah but then i consider i dont reallly like the sodacan, but its probaly most poketable vs a l8
def not l21b
idk if i should go 3x21d, l8/7
im looking to buy a sbt90 something
is l7 not?
And some prefer the form factor over the long chunky l7
But the 3x21d throws further
Ohh gotcha
Why's the l7 so good
Much much less if you get a new user deal
Super cheap TS10
20TS10D8
And I don't neeeed titanium acid etched
I like my bones
Ehhhh
I like my bones un liquidised
Yeah I'm never touching the stuff. But if you're qualified go for it
But for a used look, a wire wheel and some heavy duty rust remover with HF (iirc) will do the trick
Like that
Or do a anodised finished
And that would make it look darkened
You can acid etch it tho
I don't think titanium patinas
That's so cheap
No way
It would be so badass
I'm considering it

no flattening
just readjusting right
thank you so much <@298216330564337665>
with a full instruction set it seems foolish not too
33 left and i think im gonna buy
no
sandgrain has one on the way
no
Of it arrives before I order lemme know how it looks
<@558976020317732874>
im thinking of buying it for my grandpa for hurricane season
the website shows it if you type 999 it drops it to 60 saying thats the max available stock
lol
i eamailed their support asking for some more info on the issue
713 lumens per / 1 gbp
lol we both have the same idea and hesistations
also roughly what would the repair entail
''If you can disassemble and reassemble it yourself, it can be repaired into a normal flashlight, if not, you will get 2 pieces 26650 batteries, 1 USB charger, and 4 pieces XHP50.2 LED''   so if it burns out or i fail to fix it i get all that?
I've got the proper stuff at home but didn't bring it on holiday
It's definitely not my best work, probably uneven angles but now it's useable
Now it can push cut paper for the most part
They couldn't even slice anything
Sharpened my grandparents knives
what about 500mah is that large?
yeah theyll be charged identically, the light is only ever in turbo really so ill def know when they start running low üòÖ
I've got two p42a with slightly different capacity by 200mah or so

How dangerous is slightly mismatched cells in series
where are you located in the UK
I'm also heading to South Africa at some point in case that's helpful
And if it doesn't work out then I'll probably be there within 4 months after that
Around January I'll be heading to the US again
Depending on timing I can carry to the USA

Scawy drawr
I have 6 drawers using these style organizers so thisll go nicely in my room
I've got a drawer of super unsafe lithium
This is more for space efficiency
Gonna elevate them with a cardboard spacer so it's easier to get them
Even safer would be storing these negative up actually
Gonna do a full inventory of lights and batteries and re assign everything
Safe storage for my new batteries
It charged 300 more than discharged
Huh discharge and recharge mah are 300mah apart
I WAS ABOUT TO JOKE THAT
instead of having ~6 lights with no cell
ill keep most of them at storage charge and finally give all my lights a dedicated battery
theyre probably just well cycled and abused
im guessing they were used in his "hyper bikes" which are meant to be super fast e bikes
idk, i ordered 5 brand new, received 20 knackered used cells
ill prod gary
considering its under drained and undercharged it might be slightly higher
why?
And it did only go to 2.6 and charge to 4.17 like yours
They're Def salvage
IR not bad tho
3667mah on a p42a is rough
Also, re ran the discharge from full
Need a jury on the state of my room
Lemme get a pic of it when I'm home
If only they'd quit telling me to clean the room (after telling me to reorganize the whole house)
He knows the charger can drain the batteries when they're left in so he unplugged it because the screen was completely off
It was my dad it turns out, but he was tryna be nice
Thank you I'll try that
ü§∑ I can try but it'll likely earn me no more door
And I do get the charger beeps when it's done which is annoying, but closing the door fixes that and my lil brothers screaming on Fortnite covers it
I mean I say someone as if it's not my family

My old charger maxed at 1A so I'm not used to it being this fast or warm
Good stuff
My p42a are charging at 2.5A each and they're around 35c, is that okay?
ive only used pi's in dedicated pc setups or in 3d printers both i have 5v access
is that what people use hats for?
bish bash bosh bobs your nan
stick your 12/24v onto the power supply lines of the a4998 and your control pins to the pi
im probably missing the point, but what difference does that make?
why wouldnt you do step/dir to a a4998

My main charger is working fine so when I'm home it won't matter
Took all day but I'm all good now

What is
p sure i have a 13700
theres lots of non standard cell sizes inside of vapes
i use a a pouch style 15600 in a ts10 occasionally that i got from a old vape
not really
it might have some input power dissipated as heat
hence the minimum rating of 10A for you
assuming perfect efficiency
so if i have a system that outputs 5A at 10V and takes a 2V input then the math to find the input current is (5X10)/2 = 25A
the math for that is power = current X voltage and power is a constant
Maybe boost w2 D4 but that's it really
Looking for max capacity, this won't ever be in a high perf light
What's a solid choice for a 8a 3v buck. Considering that the driver drops to 6A almost immediately
I usually spec a p28a or whatnot
I'm completely out of the loop for normal batteries
no satisfying conclusion but give them a message and see if you get a reply
lemme send you my post
yeah ive had some contact
The recent explosion in popularity is a bit of a fad tho
now i really want a piece for my uv lights
collector fad i rweckon
ive got google translate, its always cool seeing someone elses research
id love to read it
I'll DM you rn
I do have blf, but I very very rarely check it, would you be okay messaging on my part
do you know if itll cost?
will do ü´°
it looks sweet
oooh
Maybe try a saline bath over night
or up to a week or two
ive had them be within the day sometimes

I've just gotten into bed, I'll give it a check tomorrow
<@410163261137223704> am I measuring wrong?
Most of my 18650 say 60
All my p45b say 23 or so
Damn what
What's the scale of battery quality/health regarding IR
Ah alright
Any reason why a high drain lishen that got shorted couldn't be used in a lower drain situation. I have one reading around 100mohm j think, can I just use it to power a low current light
sitrel?
haha whod you think it was
Isn't there that one on tabao
I'll have to try phone tomorrow, but it's a American number
Account is still active too
No response
Ergh emailed and Reddit messaged cybrwerks
only if the battery is warm or its been charging for ages or generally something looks off
I didn't even dissaamble, sprayed alcohol and then WD40 specialist contact cleaner
Hm i cleaned my charger with alcohol and now it's charging everything at the right currents
Nop
cyberwerk order üò°
Maybe it's internal issues
ooh whered you get that stl, it looks sick
12v alkaleak
oh nvm
whats that ?
or a teeny lipo
ah could run a boost converter directly off the battery to get the gate voltage
does it need to be high capacity or current
2 in parallel?
Although scrolling up to see the photo of a exploded battery idk
Yup
If it's a straight resistor based heater then I'd say it'll A) not be useful at 60W B) shut off since even the most basic BMS would detect over current
Depends how the heater is built tho
but i assume it can be done submerged in mineral oil
i *hope * it was a joke
With a saw
any battery is a hot*rod* if you short it for long enough
emailed him saying i want more
i dont even remember what i ordered kek
cant lie i spent so little i dont miss the money
imma wait
october i think is when i ordered
Still waiting too
Idk
ive only got some really odd battery sizes from dissasembled disposable vapes ü§£

seeing how its a primitive search engine labelling it disposable, its probably rechargeable and just the google shopping listing thats wrong
Bro if it cost 300 it's worth recharging
But it didn't show anything for a couple hours
They were some random laptop batteries
I've recovered a couple
My xtar does
I'm a rare torch collector now üòé
Oooohhhh
Oh damn okay
Idk if I should try trade up or get a fancy rare item for the collection
Even though it's raw
Damn
It would remove the machining marks/grooves but it would make the light prettier
There's some fairly solid scratches and a scuff from being dropped
Would polishing it be a sin
are they rare?
Getting it polished up and then hopefully swapping to pink LEDs
I have plans for this torch üòé
Sorry dude
2200mah and 5A
They're low discharge and capacity tho
Idk 2 Samsung cells weigh at 41g each
Lemme weigh a good batt
They came with the rot66
43.3g per <@544931397048205312>
okay
uh oh
oh yeah thats it
üíÄ
I've got some 5600mah 18650 from surefire
Yeah they should be okay
I'm traveling with 23 üòéüò≠
Ah yeah
I shorted one for at least 20s and the wire melted before the battery got too hot to hold
Ah gotcha, how many are you looking at buying
Hey I'm in the USA until the 2nd of September if you pay for all of it I can bring them back to the UK (assuming no issues at TSA)
Are those the super high current
i could swap for a copper pillar
whats a good level
i can measure resistance on mine rn
yup
i think 6mm dia is largest i go for
oh yeah mb  i forgot im using p45bs rn, a single 3mm worked good
rather go for the negative + positive of the two batteries in series
3 was a little undersized
6mm total is whats working nicely
i think so, lemme go measure my stack first
yeah i had that too, i put a magnet spacer in the middle of them, you could also try simons spacer for series batteries
The plane ticket might be worth it
What's your collection like
Okay <@458297028028399626>
On my way
If I see a already broken scooter I'll nab it
I'll keep that in mind
Interesting
idk tho
i suppose, ill do some reading
ahh, i was gonna say ill pay you to chuck some in a alley in london and i wouldnt be stealing
are you in london?
im not tryning to get in trouble
idk that seems like theft
and maybe chuck a couple of those in a specific bush for me to collect ü´°
for legal reasons
elaborate
erm <@305391737331908608>
weigh em
one high cap and pther high discharge
if anyone has two 18650s of the same brand
actually
id assume the hogher capcity
You just whip out the core and touch the wires (don't bother soldering to nichrome it's very difficult)
Yup
Make sure it's got those funny coiled up wires inside for heating
U can take the heater from a hairdryer and use it as a beefed up resistor
Got a old hairdry or nichrome wire?
Yeah stick a component in there and check
Oh like it can read on a multimeter but not actually power much
And no internal shorts? (In the lights)
No smart features in the module
Is the battery working?
its a samsung warp charger so likely 9V, they do high =er than 5V for faster charging on comopatible devices
4680 torch when?
Really hard
Blow on them
I see, but why not a pretty light with anduril and set a low ceiling on the ramp
Why build one? Why not a fc11 or sc31 pro which has integrated charging
Why/what changed your opinion
I see two sketches too, how would you get the two vertical parts separately like that
Yeah I was agreeing
Jlc does both
Or ultem
Mjf nylon could
yeah resin only, gotta withstand 170c maximum - it probably wont hit 170c but it wont get any hotter for sure. its not load bearing
hey, looking for a someone with a resin printer to make a couple parts, ill take any colour and resin. i just need two parts to hold a bulb, max dia of 80mm, its two rings + some mounting features
united-kingdom-üá¨üáß

Beautiful machine. How big is it?
plus all metal kits available
youtube.com/watch?v=1_YokHgagIQ
im biased, but i prefer the vzbot. its got a full manual, nearing 100 serialised builds and a LOT of stuff going on behind the curtains (custom hotend and partnerships)
do you mean real time. or just the itme being printed

why not print it in the orientation its shown in the photo?
if you dont mind waiting a while, ill be in america in the summer. if you pay shipping i can print out a couple of those
I can print some, quality won't be perfect though, are you in the UK?
Hm. If it's working fine with identical wiring when plugged into another driver then yes it's a driver fault. If it behaves the same way then it's a wiring issue
id suggest crossing the inner two wires, there shouldnt be any damage from crossing wires
dang thats a good friend
Does it really matter if I stay on W10 until I like 11

np
create new profile, newest fabric version, click the three dots, go to folder/file, navigate to "mods", drop .jar
i use curseforge
i dont know it
but
basically, theres a way to do it all willy nilly in file explorer
soo
ah calm, yeah
you talking abt client or server
this is the file structure you should see, give or take
weird right
pretty much
one sec
drag every .jar from the "mods" folder in the server.tar i sent you to your "mods" folder in your server
one youve got the fabric server setup and launched once you should see a folder called "mods"
no ones being helpful
yo wanna do it in dm

Got a pic
Toggle switch?
Check out peircing the darkness on yt he reviewed the ns14
There's a upcoming group buy from taobao so you'll be able to get something cheap there

Wait until I'm back in the UK to buy any lights
The ns14 is a little cheaper
Also I got a torch with a blue and red emitter, theyre monochromatic which looks crazy irl
Also I gotta show you a couple torches
Thank you üòÄ

You can message him?
Absolutely no clue
Check out his repl

You use natural language and it can execute functions on your phone
Also my brother made a gpt4 smart assistant

Could always just use a transformer
That's what she said üòòüòò
Nah never seen one
I'll plastic wrap it for you
It can always fit in a large carrier bag
In this economy? Not bad

Hey Leon, I'm so sorry to ask you this late, but could you convert a playlist to MP3 for me. I leave for my flight at 7 TMRW and I forgot
yeah id love to try and imitate this someday
AI video conversion
Best gif ever
Yuppp
Also audio version
Even if not it allows you turn quick scribbles into complex imagery
And possiblly a lot more temporal stability
This should add a whole new level of consistency
Cause then it would blend style and some of the background and the character would probably be more stable
I wanna see a vid2vid that inputs the previous frame to img2img and the newest frame to be transferred into controlnet
Does pose transfers and general composure carry
Yeah it's awesome
Implications? ü§®ü§®ü§®
This is a half realistic pepega
You've seen this original before, all I did was use a anime model and type "anime style cozy drawing"
It lets you Keep characters or poses or general composition of a image while still entirely changing it
Controlnet dropped this week
And AI
Hehehehehe
Funny stuff first
Suffering through mobile discord
Nah man I'm already in bed sorry
And some AI stuff
Wanna see something funny
Hey leon

if you have 70 quid and feel like spending it even if just for the experience id say its worth
facial interface+controller knuckles
its a very good deal
im getting good at this
new version

im still trying to get a better result
its a plugin
using deforum
yee
watch with sound on
on a 3060ti üôâ
12it/s with batch size 8
prompt was just chair chair chair chair chair chair
and i get a higher it/s in larger batches
speeed
last ones from a custom model
same prompt/seed/sampler. different models
might get better perf with some of what this guys done
Still stuck on that
I haven't figured out training for a style uet
Doing another 2x upscale
Not much aliasing
It's pretty good right
its 4k
try set as background, its close to 16:9 already
insane level of detail
ldsr upscaled
not bad painted style eh
Ahaha "enjoy school", ahhh funny guy
Ahg that sucks, get well soon man
High cfg looks deep-fried til 80+ steps
You won't see a difference at a low cfg
Should be minor things
L
Just got to bed
Dpm,++ 2m has been a fast converging and high it/s sampler for me
Around 5 steps later it'll be completely different
It changes at every step
That's how Euler a works
Nah that's Euler a right
past 12 ish its alright]
different step count 1-99
1-30 cfg in steps of 0.5
Cheers

i know theres some funny business with AMD
id check that stable diffusion supports intel cards
lemme google
but hows them tensors
ü•µ  16gb means fast dreambooth, how many tensor cores tho (i wanna try  NeRF)
ye
yupp, you can see some funny noise tho. i think combining is best, thats what im running now
ldsr seems to add realistic detail, swinir and rerasgan just bluured and removed aliasing
ldsr and swinir ook best imo
and ldsr is taking its time to upload
swinir 2x
r-ersagn 4x

Inpainting removed a section and regenerates it
Outpainting adds more image
Outpainting or inpainting?
Cheers
Send me anything.....?interesting?
I'm off to bed
Welp
Try one seed and compare the difference with different brackets
And more brackets means more important
Brackets to separate prompts keywords
(No titties)
And negative prompt
Honestly I expected (((((titties)))) (((((titties)))) (((((titties)))) to be the prompt
Prompt?
Use inpainting to remove the second belt and fix the face and it'd be perfect
ü§®

Mhm
huh?
is the am4 moutning hardware in  here
ah cool
why
is this any any good
is it a good presentation
thats fine, no role is best
cheers
also gimme msg perms
can u proofread this
and i dont mind a clear fan
easily repleacable
the vetrroo is already black
e.g
sure, but a better bearing is still better and i mayaswell save a couple buck and get the better product
that doesnt inspire confidence
19 years minimum for a hydraulic bearing to fail
even if neither has failed yet
sure but a better bearing is still better
**likely**
so thats another plus
and the v5 has a hydraulic bearing
looks like its either a hydraulic bearing which is fine for a pc or a sleeve bearing which is quieter but ill suited to varibale speeds
well seems like the listing is lying then
pom makes for terrible fan bearings
POM is just acetal which makes it a shit bearing. therefore making the v5 (by default) the better fan
extra heat pipe, rgb for when martin has the pc, anodized everything
which bearing does it have?
then i believe you are illiterate
it has more features and presumably more thermal mass but thats hard to tell
this is on amazon, warranty is pretty much a moot point
there was nithing to misunderstand, i told you itd mini jst and you went on a rant about a different standard that lightly resembled the pictured connector (which is clearly a jst mini)
that would make it a not jst mini. it would just have the same pitch
right but you see my point is that ive looked at the vetroo connector, its very clearly a standard jst mini
they made a standard, knockoffs are just following the standard
üò≤
so they are all the same and wont be melted shut?
could have been the same pitch and worked
doesnt make it jst
jst is a company that has a standard set of connectors 
then it wasnt jst
again, nothing permanent
its been aorund for years
again what other jst exist, dont make baseless claims then ignore them. i will again reiterate. admit if you dont know something and avoid looking like a jackass
the fuck other mini jst exist
also the v5 is anodized and has an extra heatpipe
yes but this is a standard mini jst
you coulodnt solder it on
you do realize that those plugs are mini jst right, ive got one right here in my hand
made of plastic
soldered into a plug
you gotta be kidding me
plenty big
would be easy to undo
that connector is pretty big
yeh
vs a random name buying from the same factory
i cant see what bearing type the hyper uses
ah shucks, either way, i think the vetroo is gonna be higher quality
rgb dont weigh 200g
also assuming product weight is accurate, the hyper 212x has less thermal mass than the vetroo
for what i usually work with, they big
ill just remove the pin
yeh so i wont break it
you just push it back in
its easily reversible
you see, this is where you go wrong
i dont think you know how to crimp then
i have a crimp set
i can just remove the pin and replace it later
a little snip to the wire would fix it
i can turn it off
sorry just trying to play devils advocate, the v5 has the anodized coating and looks sleeker but the cooler master has a bigger name
v5
hypoer
the v5
4 vs 5
also the 212x has 1 less heatpipe
what bearing?
but the noise is kinda  a pain
gpu stays under 65
or more
i hitting 70c
the v5 has one more heatpipe tho
My Bad you mook
oh mb
same price but more heatpip
or this one
gamers nexus compared
no, noise equilized it was within 1 degree
so it makes sense
the measurments were on the same cpu i use
with noise equalized
and this performs within 1c of noctua equiv
expensive
probably cooler master
but im trying to minimize the rgb, its distracting
only the case fans
this cooler
alright so noctua or thermal grizzly
or i can reuse some thermal pads i have laying around
im getting a new cooler, so need new thermal paste
also should i repaste the gpu
why would i use liquid metal, isnt it 1000+ degrees celcius, would get a very good overcock with those temps
but it say 14db and will those 5 watts make my cpu hotter
will this thermal paste be too loud
reinv would ya
time to join and ask if people wanna do gartic / jackboz tonight
any % ban speedrun complete
mind giving me no roles
well it fully works so you name a price and ill check with my dad
lol hes a idiot
hoq much are you offering
To
My parents are happy to sell the PC to you as long as your parents are happy tk
no, i go on holiday to mix it up and spend time with family outdoors
i wont take it with me unless i move house
you keep bringing it up, i said i was ok and dint need help yesterday and you kept bothering me
fusion360 simulations are very computation heavy, i will eventually need a upgrade
wdym?
for when new stuff comes out and i want it in my compooper
oopsie daysie
my finger slipped
bitch
but no upgrade path
leon shush you you fat neek
in my use case you are
ether way, you are wrong
its a bit retarded to get a liability inside a laptop instead of just getting a backup battery supply
i wont take the coputer out the house ever and ill just use a long cable for vr, power has only gone out once in my life and that was during a stormy night when i was asleep
or just dont have a battery in the first place
itll just lead to the battery expanding over long use
and using a battery as a psu is quite stupid
i dont wanna deal with a aging battery
also I don't want to have a battery inside the pc
Alright. When's overclocking bad
a desktop is more modular, serviceable, overclockable and martin thinks its cooler
Do you want me to copy paste that or rephrase it and video in the discord server or to each person
np
'@Lil_lazychicken @The Trollfather  leons blocked the both of you'
jfc so unaware
yup, i play btd, suggest a new tower that i enjoy. 'ew thats awful, are you fucking retarded dipshit thats bad'. three minutes later. 'why u only use my tower choice, get ur own'
nah theyre dickheads and some point they'll make it to the real world where we dont put up with them and we can laugh
yeah fair enough. it ruins the mood when ur playing a game and say something wrong and all of a sudden they call you a retard and kick you out the call
also, just told them both
what happened
Will flush cutters work
Why those?
Nah just the bottom falls off so we can just put it there
If you bring a strip to school
Yah just like a strip of it
You mind if I borrow
It looks like glue behind it like a liquid one but of tape fits then sure
Dunno. Don't think so, there's not much room behind the display
Do you have a glue for phone screens

Really
Got this apple pc
Is there anything I should get when I'm there next
Just went to a electric dump
nice
yup
he thoufgt a bright light pointed at a monitor would break it
Getting water
Gimme a sec
Sure
Why vc
5m is a gta mod kinda
5m the game
a USB cable from the USB-A ports on the Raspberry Pi to your printer. You probably have one of these; your printer should have a USB connector 452. Preferably this should be short with a ferrite bead;
Rest of room
Hand for scale
ask dylan to unmute me
Thye might not even be broken
We can get 2 eol printer thingies
Yo
Possibly
So we migt get one
My dad knows someone who sells mfp printersd
Depends, if we go to the dump i can meet you there and then decide what to do from there
Ill try find another but if not wanna just go to the dump
Yeh its too far away and my dad doesnt want to drive#
i cant get the printer
Cool
Lemme eat then ill get on
I just woke up
Pm
Like before 7 or after 740
Cool during the day or night
Is it Friday that you're coming over?
6 ibsley way
en4 9ey
different vc for other stuff
Imma get the printer on Wednesday
Unless you feel like helping haul it around
No, i wouldnt be able to carry it
Nah my dads got work all week
I either have 30m on monday potentially friday but probably not
Bit of a predicament
Theres no timne when i would be able to get there
i might not be able to pick up the printer
How's saturday, i can get the printer friday
10m
You in?
We can scrap it, you take what you want them off to the dump with the frame and free stuff
In illford
Ill screencap it
Perhaps we can scrap a printer
Oo la la
Nice, lmk what day and time works for you and i can book 2 people
Wanna go to the dump next weeked?
Outbid by 50p
No bids and 7m left
Im getting it now
Everything else we can sell, and the frame i can take to the dump and while ime there try get free shiz
Pretty much motion components
Lol i just want the steppers, dc motors and servo motor drivers pus belts,gears, leadscrews, shafts and lens
Ohhhh
Niice, how'd you get them to give it to you
Was it a commercial one or consumer one
Duh, you can have the parts you want and i get the parts i want, in exchange i get help lifting and dissembling
If i cant fix it ill get a shit ton of spare bits and bobs and nema17-32 motors
4 hour round trip to collect
0.99 with 18h on bid left
600 refurbuished
Just found a gold mine
Oi
Ah he knows my brother

Are there any slicers that can do this on a Cartesian printer, I need something to flex with
Trianglabs hardened steel is a fraction of the price and I've dropped mine, hit it with a hammer, shattered 3 sheets of glass with it and snapped a heat break with it. Its fairly solid and very cheap just buy 2 in case one has a machining defect
Would the vacuum not make water boil or bubble and rip up the filament. Heat slowly coaxes it out where's a vacuum is quick and unforgiving
My macro doesnt work anymore, not sure why but it wont move to the center, it moves a few mm but thats it

gcode:

Can I run the adxl test with the shaking without collecting data or using a adxl, I would like to test if my printer can move at those frequency for extensed periods
Is there a way to run the test without collecting data, I would like to make sure my frame us sturdy

fuck off
very nice
damn thats clean
i started going recently partly cause you talked abt it and cause i saw vez going- i gotta look good posing with my printer
mb
oh mustve been someone else
tempting üòÖ
last time we properly talked you were starting to hit up the gym, hows it going
ahh if i see you ill say hi
i think im going with the vz team. i havent kept with all that recently
sweet
üéâ
you going to smrrf this year?
awh ill miss kyle
cmon you cant deny the vzbots sex appeal
did he steal it? or just worked together
oh fr?
whatve i missed in zerog
ive got a summer job to pay it off
ive got the oooold zerog "prototype" still going and now a vzbot
i manged to convince my parents to let me get a 3rd printer üòé
had to make some brand changes
woah woah woah
sorry i havent been so active but i got a ton of exams going on
Why, what'd I miss?
sent it to shane yet? üòÜ
i really gotta get some rgb
thats gonna rip at vr
oolahlah
you'd probably want to buy the knuckles strap, headstrap and powerbank (3d printable) from kiwi design
also, if you get a quest 2 which i would reccomend, since you can use it anywhere and stil have a good wireless pcvr setup
only prerequisite for getting a quest 2 is if its ipd settings are closr to your ipd
if you get a quest 2 that is
i wold recommend using airlink then over wired
not sure how mesh works for link but one gbps is plenty
Also how far away from your router would you play vr
Cool, so how many people are on your wifi. And do you have high internal speeds
What price range, how much room do you have to walk in and what's your PC specs
not shanejoe
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
now it works
oh duh
i dont see that option anywhere
im so confused
ik,,= but where do you enable/disable it
also i dont see it, not sure im doing it right
how could i abuse it?
and how do i time out
howd you get it
thats pretty neat
Neither do I, but just wait till you see these specs
Assuming you want phat layers or high speed
Watch out for the new lgx, it's very promising
üòÑ
oooo, so shiny. thats gonna make a pretty good speed benchy
lucky, stupid brexit means i can get one from maze
and finally doing a good high quality build
guess whos looking into dismantling the last registered 'zero g: bad edition‚Ñ¢'
Nice, much more visible on camera then
Ah just lending or trialing one?
Theyre pretty nice, only reason i dont have one is money and the seam between the screens
Damn. The z fold 3, right?
Ah thats probably fine then, 2d image doesnt convey 3 dimesions too well
Looks kinda thin and the weight of the fan+heat
Ah nice, will that bracket slowly bend though?
Ah nice, i assume for drivers
Water or air?
A cooler?
Uh 1 hint?
yup, just make sure to put that in somewhere, veery clearly or else people are gonna think they have to overpay
that way is no extra effort mostly and gives people the choice to buy the same thing with or without supporting you
you can create two versions of the BOM one with affiliates and the other without and label them clearly. that way most people will choose the affiliate but theres also a completely clean BOM that exists
nah that was maze, i dunno how to do emoji's
true but point still stands, more time difference
yup, didnt want 20s differences between a good and bad print, rather 5-10m between highest quality and highest speed
yup, wanted to keep the time long so that it was a bigger difference between printers
upload and well probably start rating it
nice
not bad, a solid first place, although no ones entered yet
put in the entry
rac got 1hr 10

At AliExpress Portals, you can start creating your affiliate links. The program does allow deep linking so you can create a link to any specific product on AliExpress you wish. You can also link to AliExpress special deal pages and you are even able to create a link to search results.
AliExpress affiliate lets you promote products on the website and earn a predefined commission on each sale while dropshipping allows you to promote the products on your website (as yours) and earn as much profit as you want (since you get to set the profit margins yourself).
This color is Much nicer on the eyes
Gotta change your pfp
This ones good
Yup
Maybe a royal perple
I prefer this one or a darker red
Bruh the zero g logo for the server keeps changing color
Niice
Looks pretty good, i gotta install fluidd so i can use the themes, mind sending the color (in whatever format fluidd uses for the color code thingy)
It looks pretty good, is it actually .2mm slices
The zerog logo or the layering?
Is this for 4wd or just cool render
Discrete they say
discord for zero g printer, good quality
fcba03

ff00ee
I assume the language thing is slurs but expletives are fine
Ill just set it to matthew
alright im on
Eating dinner. Ill hop on when I finish
Of course I wanna see
How's that even a question
But ill have to wait and see, itll be closer to a year til i upgrade anyways
Im starting to think merc1 with 4wd is what i wanna build
Less ringing at high speed, more torque at any speed
May have to reconsider what i build, but ill probably wait until closer to the time
Ah cool, should be a awsome upgrade
Does klipper support 2 drivers per axis
Wiring will be the biggest issue though, you could use a splitter or connect the two drivers logic and all that shabang but you should talk to someone more knowledgeable about that
Nope nevermind, just checked their inductance and its same as wantai, they look good for a 4wd setup
But beforw you order
Oooooooooh
LDO-42STH47-2504AC. Those should be the ones. I posted the spec sheet and torque curves yesterday and I think a link can be found in the ratrig bom/sourcing guide
Aww, so adorable
Ahh, cool
Which part needs those
Ayy my two contributions are endstop related
True, im no pro with abs
Just make sure the part near the screws is flat then it would b easy
Hehe, goodluck
Ah that looks good, should be a really good update
Around there or directly next to the duct tips
On the side of the duct, you could add two screws/pins that guide the switch, make a slide that is unengaged by moving y and have a teeny footprint
Gimme a sec
When my nozzle is far right the bed can raise past the nozzle so if you have a vertical mount with small plastic guide rods and then magnets you can have a teeny footprint
Depends on how you mount it, i was thinking a corner bracket could have it integrated or you could mount it on the bed
Do people reach the very front left, it would suck to do a g32 and run the blocks off the rails
Wheres it gonna go on the toolhead, also where on the frame
Beats my tinkercad skills, whats the plan for a mount position
<a:hypercatvibe:743208354192818238>
Cool
Ah, ill wait then. Eta is like merc1 release and wholy dependent on feeback then?
Hey, sorry to bother, but if i print the eva parts and ship them the minute eva releases is that okay and if not whats a rough eta
Just need spacers, new printed parts and thats it
Yeah, its also a lot cheaper for me to go to
I gotta save up for the new parts, but i may end up going to vzbot
Cool
Ez
Ah. Ill ask if they want Eva. If its yes ill ask if they want to wait until something new
They never receive files. I say its homebrew and they take the Eva. Or just keep it under wraps
Lemme explain better
I was letting maze know that thats a thing that exists that many people do so names of channels may want to stay more vague and I said if anything is there that indicates a secret something or other I wont leak it
it shoul also do everyhting except verify videos automatically
alright, theyre working on a different project, but when they finish they'll give it a shot
ill check if they're still willing to make one
yep
i can move the parts on my desk they arent glued down or anything
yes
quick print so tolerances of +-0.5mm
for precision i used a 1mm nozzle
3d printed linear rails
Can't wait to mount these bad boys to the printer
this release is gonna be so dope
even better
ah, not worth it then
i wonder if a color code for m5,m4 and m3 screws would be worth the effort
oo thats much better
dude this is honestly a whole new level of production quality
yeah custom is probably the way to go, e5 is very limiting for stiffness and size
but thats a year or more away
yeah i honestly cant wait to see what v3 is
dang this is much more professional than the first
yeah, other than that its good
alright, only suggestion is a exploded view of how the parts align, with lines showing how holes align too
Cool. I'll read through it and tell you how it is
Like HD or Stupid Proof
Sure. In terms of resolution or clear to follow
Yah
Probably just nuclear weapons
Then again
Ah sorry
oh yeah, no prob
yes
or can i omit the tl collet and top bowdens stuff (my hotend has space for a collect clip)
ok, heres all the .stl's i need, right?
also the big belts means more rigidity, right. so higher speeds technically
but i would recommend including a slightly larger version for ~15. becuase (i think) with larger belts you can do bigger build sizes
$10 is very reasonable
true, higher speed are worthless without super volcano or a custom block. but imagine being able to boast 40k acc
oo, if i get the money for that i would buy it, what about a nema 23 with a gearing ratio of 1:1.5 with a 16 tooth pulley so you get high torque and high speed or a 40 tooth pulley and a ratio of 2:1
if its guaranteed compatible and custom designed then i think plenty of people would purchase
but i do think commission stuff is the way to go, while some pre made stl can be sold i think custom designs that are compatible with the zero g are priceless.
if the stuff is woth it i would 100% buy it
lol
ill print them and see how they work
thank you for the help
nice
ahhh, snazy, so i print these instead of the belt clamps and left/right carriage
i can always use skew correction
dope
oh nice, will this work with v1?
which is?
true, looks like you could get 2amp 28v with suffcicient cooling
yeah, i think he meant that thething to obses about for speed isnt always weight
pretty much, the gist of it was dont go overboard but dont bother trying to get it down to a feather
yeah, with the 6:30 benchy
sick, i asked nitram for tips on speed, he said weight doesnt matter too much (as long as you arent lugging around 50kg of weight) but he said overvolting is best, how far can i overvolt with 2209s
nice, just figuring out the lifespan of my v1, im guessing 5 months before i bother updating, cheers
cool, so roughly 1-3 months
very very very roughly, like on a month to month basis?
yeah
roughly whats your estimate on the eta for this
that looks sick
i wont
how do i do that sorry?
do you think theyd add it?
if youve got 100 scrobbles in any song youll be close to top 10 for sure

hm
nah
is fm bot in here?
I love relistening to RA songs j didn't like, buckle up boy is underrated (minus the chorus which slows the flow) and let go for love which is great all around

Also recently re listened to RA1 and man some of the songs are so good favourite has got to be 
My school's got Hebrew latin Spanish and french
Hey peoples of RA, in full moon who's ruby soho
Anyone know if there's a music video/animation in the works for good guy and Wayne's world 2
weathers and idkhow are pretty good. i switch between you and them two for commutes
^
that still has to run off someones dataset and training
ohhh im slow, sorry. u mean img2img. image x in ----> image y out
yeah thats dreambooth, you can run it anywhere. you feed it images and it creates a model for the AI. again, dataset creators
yeah so again, dataset creators
and the dataset creators are the stealers
midjourney uses a cherry picked dataset ad it shows in their creations, theyve likely paid for their data
the real enemy here is the dataset creators, not those that use it
yeh but thatd take years to train
no point arguing, im not smart enough to convince you
anyways
tjhats what the AI does
same if i looked at for example ananalog on twitter and tried to make something myself that looks simiklar
yeh thats how the model im talking about is trained
its not sampling or stealing or recreating. its like staring into a cloud and thinking it kinda looks like a dog and then imaging more of that dog

do you know how stable diffusion works? ill be honest and admit i had no clue til a week ago
how so?
i dont post any of it under the false idea that its handmade or real art. so i see no harm in making and sharing
but its not stealing and it makes image generation much more accessible
and mine takes less time and effort
its a very different skill
im not an artist for sure
i can be much more creative with it
nah its sick

please put a .txt or .docx file here with your minutes after every meating
video recording after each session go here
any 3d CAD models go here
lol, it gets reposted quite often
cool
if my part is the testing and analysis part, do i need to have it by friday
2 small scale models one with design flaws and the other without
any ideas or developments or articles to read go here
not sure, youll have to ask

do these usually work?
It's probably very close to my other top songs tho
Wouldn't say it my favourite, certainly most listened to though
Out here paying their rent fr fr
But i dont have a hour of time to sit here just to interact with a server i enjoy??/???
Ah fuck that, im not sitting here for an hour
How do i do that
How do i get to other text channels
Gey boi gonna gey

Genuine question btw
What's wrong with those
Tell you they accidentally got Ur acc banned
Classic discord scam
np
hey <@448202437808095232> , <@1077292027026354186> has just dmed me
well well well, look who it is
lol, we typed it out at the same time
it stays at the top of the printer and the bed moves down, keeping it at the top of the model
<@!142197484821676032> why only the first few
and cool the part with just hevacs and sub ambient air
mines for part cooling mostly, im hoping to be fast enough that filament doesn't time to sit in the heat sink enough to melt
yeah mines gonna have a lot of condenssation if thats right
ahh
how would i prevent condensation
And what fan do I want. High cfm or something else
Hi sorry I missed your message, yes I want sub ambient cooling
i dont mind if the inside heats up i mostly print pla so aslong as it stays low enough, and the intake would be outside the box near the cooler
could i use my printer inside a gutted mini fridge and use the cooling eleemnt under the intake of the hevacs
<@173827530929733632>
if the makers are willing to design and create it for free wouldn't that mean its more expensive, they know that they can get you in with this deal and then they'll profit from the sale
nice
what do you use those kinds of lasers for
oh yeah, that would work too, i just would be veeery cautious using a laser of high power and a mirror
<@487739686622724107>. For the hevacs what size fan is used and do I need a high speed or high airflow fan
Like mike said a fiber optic cable would be nice and a easy way to angle the laser in the oposite direction of the nozzle would be a mount at the center of the nozzle (height above doesnt matter) then usr a rope on a pulley mounted and top center of bed means it would pull against where its going
When they walked for 40 hours every day to space and back all uphill
Crap guys they found my grandparents school from back in the old days
Thought you meant the things by the toolhead and wanted to check
Ah cool
wheres that
Also means if some low inductance stepper has barely any torque we can use 2 for even more torque
More torque at same power
it looks like its springy in the vid, might just be there for fun and to watch it whip around, then again it might be a antenna for 5g wireless hotends
For Purim
She has a maid dress
Ask hannah
Nathan
Towere placement
Am i doing it right
i leave on friday lol
unmute dumy

Join my coop game on Bloons TD 6! 
it would probably be quite expensive and we're heading back to school quuite soon
alright
were you able to get the CAD?
thats what ive been asking, no one who joined since v1 was released has been allowed beta testing access
shut it
dilan u monkey
<@173827530929733632>
solid view of those springs
looks good to me
Wow so much cleaner than mine, congrats on that looovely cable managment
might wanna check in with someone a bit more qualified tho
im no pro but that mount looks a little molten
lol you just gonna skip over the fact that hes the same age as me
i turned 15 last month
i started my build a month before i turned 13
but then again mine doesnt cost 1.4k. either way its progress
tbf my printer is similarily jank
Straight on, no sanding
And painted with what looks like acrylic paint
Yeah and the toolhead is made of pla
That's pretty good. You could probably cut those rails down into small enough chunks for k2
how much did it cost <@!429909484056608768>
whos he
and more wobbly prints that are terribly aligned
MOAR CHONKER
Yup, but visiting the us for a few weeks tmrw
How do a phrase it?
Well, i was gonna get it to the US but it wouldnt arrive intime, ill check again though
Any way to get around the VAT
Time to loosen my belts then
With it loose?!
Oh no. So small and simple yet so easy to miss
What was it?
Mine is just like that/s
Maybe anti backladh and less wear+ drop
To the x bar
On a pulley
Its on a string
Counter weight
Interestings
check the inner bearings, all the toothing profiles are consistent and maybe try without bowden tube
Can you msnually extrude alright
Maybe clog
The knocking?
It'll make the toolhead look like its floating
Bit late but have you considered having the linear rail and belts hidden behind the 2020
Hm
Ill keep a look out for them
Lmao
No worries. I'll take it off your hands for a small fee
Pog
May as well clean up the printer and give it a shot. But cover something niche but cool. My original plan was a direct comparison between going against community knowledge (long Bowden is bad Bowden) and then following their advice and showing how true it is
You could Try start a yt channel in your spare time or whenever your bored. Create one short video detailing a niche problem you had and how to fix it. If its a hit you could get sponsored to review parts for the experimental machine. Or not, but that's my plan/dream
Ah I was going to suggest talking to Devin in the vzbot server. Iirc hes working buikding cnc and 3d printers as a side gig
Ivw found that using one as a test platform is much better than using both
Are you under 18?
It depends what you enjoy about 3d printing though
I found that once I built a second faster printer I used the other less
<@!429909484056608768>
Check out omni 3d and clay 3d
I think its just steel coloured or similar to the frame
Mine is on the printer rn
True that
Could print the shell but it would br a pain
Yeesh. Are the parts worth reusing or are they worn too
Or will i need to get the new motors soon and then run the print
Well will my vzbot count
The printed parts and belt path and a cf tube and new carriage and probably a new set of idlers
Ill be upgrading to a vzbot soon and doing a real speedboat then
Ive got  30m one but that wasnt really a speedbenchy
Mmm egg frying temp
How do those nema14's keep up
Also this discord will provide support for the build
Well in that github there should be some pdf's with details
Do you plan on modding them, the tronxy can be converted to a vzbot  (
Or any other diy printer, hes completetly lost it for me, stefan is still alright, hes advocating high speed bowden printers on 3mm filament. But his engineering and filament testng is legit
yOuR dElTa Is So InNaCuRaTe
Also how do you phonetically pronounce paneldue
Im watching the meltzone podcast and thomas is saying the voron is the highest end fanciest shmancy printer
pSh CaNt VaLuE wHaT yOu DoNt HaVe/s       good luck
For the designer
Ah, called it (then changed my mind)
Really straight and just using thermal pads for now
Havent sanded it just yet
Just got a perfect first layer on my fr4 sheet
Best i can say is do it by eye
Tuning it in is really hard
Ah, i have some bad news. When theres any pressure on the paper the bed just bends to deflect it
Is the bed cantilevered
The paper is just to get a consistent offset not the final height, also is this on the stock bed
Take some clips and clamp down the sides and stack aluminum foil underneath the middle
But you could look at some hi metalic all metal ender 3 heatbreaks
I was gonna buy one of those for its rails and convert it to vslot anx re sell it
Rigid mounted v6 and krken Heatbreak and a volcano block and nozzle
Da fuck
Yup. Same Heatbreak
Check out the Ali link I sent
You could potentially make a spacer with the one you currently have but that would be a disservice to the copperhead
Dunno what you would even print
So the belts huh, 10M+?
Ah dang it.I was hoping some pne here was building that beast
Whos is that
<:mindblown:704426403730423969>
Im not sure if diameter is the same otherwise they look good to me
Dunno if copperhead will be compatible, but good luck
Mmmmmmmm, i could do better
Why would they make that
<:unfunny:831618330846036008>
And its a groovemount?
Best bet is kraken and a volcano block then
Never seen that before
Lol
<:oof:737069085325787136>
You mean it has a long nozzle and a v6 bottom heatbreak but kraken/e3 top
So im gonna say its a weird kraken
That looks more like mk8
Send a side profile of the nozzle
Thats a m6 thread right, it says 'cracking' i assume that means cracken and thats a e3d product so then it should be mk8 since mk10 is m7. Bruh
Well then i think thats m6
If I remeber the MK10 is an M7 thread, and MK8 is an M6 thread.
Yeah both are smooth
Possibly mk8 too, gimme one sec
No problemo
Sorry set screw is the wrong word
Ah yeah
Like the heater cartridge but heatbreak
Nah, volcanos are just v6 but long blocks
Although iirc the kraken has something similar
Ah, looks like a stock e3 hotend, they have a smooth throat and a set screw
Dumb design but if it works
They might be in slots to allow for any z wobble to happen at the motor instead of the bed
kinda, but its got some extra belts for moving a spindle up and down and for spinning a spindle
Clearly
For sls
Printes parts
White powder
Yes
pog
super light y axis
thats my plan, build a super cheap vzbot from a e5 for my school and get them started with actual 3d printing and get a high speed delta
dayum, is it something everyone can do or is it more a right place at right time kinda thing
And dont let <@141593844788494336>. See
But lopsided
thanks
alright i joiined, waiting to be accepted
cool
where do i find those for sale
i was gonna buy the mp mini
so longer arms are faster, i might buy a really asmall cheap delta and make it go really fats with a tiny build volume
does it make no difference
will longer or shorter arms on a delta be faster
Dann. Looks clean. May build that as a 3rd printer
but its only on long straight moves and circles
yup
alright, ill install it friday and when the board arrives i shall prove you wrong, but i dont think it weighs much sooooo
i can get 125k acc and 350mm/s on my half baked build so if you do yours right you can get some insane speeds
f
try less microsteps
not high eough step rate
it may be a stepping limit
yep
Its from voron
No he built a switchwire
Mercury one rotated to ender 3 and have a bed slinger would be badass
shes a beauty
that or a whole lot of fudging stuff together
its so stupid, cheap chinese stuff works most of the time
but yeah teaching tech is fairly boring in tone but his content is great
mike who?
great video but that guy's a bit of a peen
its very strong and quite easy
SERVOS'
nope
how i wish it was cheaper to buy than rent
lucky
ive got plenty years left before im expected to own a home at the average age of 30
hopefully prices unfuck themselves
thank god ive got a while until i buy a house
All of my panels are installed, all thats left is electronics and the front panel
You see in but all light bounces aroind the chamber
I assume for better lighting
a rigid mount to that slab is beneficial but make sure you have that entire thing soft mounted or else its still a large speaker
or suspend it will cables
a large concrete slab ontop of dense foam
Apart from that. I saw something about skill or a live stream and something about nothing apart from the discord and form
Do we need to do anything other than sign up
thank you
<@!451709396280410132>  could you copy and paste your config for the ras pi temp monitoring
Only a small bit of input
Yep
Hey guess who got asked to help vez for the cooling
lemme know when you get to corexy
ahh, youre still on catresian
try a higher speed
so i see a ton of weird priters like this
oh yeah those are really cool, i watched a ton of vids like these on loop so tht youtube would reccomend them often
thw whole idea is to use very little space and have ;large reach, so a long rail is better than multiple rails
just a cool video i found
not my design
oh, i heard the 5161 were better and more upgraded
wait, wut, i thought they werent released yet
ill be waiting for 5161's then be pgrading
nice
not much fine tuning then, does it work well
ah, well once i get them ill figure it out, but when i build the v2 i guess ill be getting those and a 4wd mod with the highest A stepper
ah are they from -256 to 256
how are the drivers, quiet or louder and are there any issues youve had
Cheers
Temp
Also how would I monitor my pi cpu tem0
Wait I need a fet board?
More quality
Yep those are pretty good
With this. Im using a fairly cheap camera so on a quality samsung telephoto with 10x zoom you could get really really close
Quality machining
so professional, same quality i expect from ultimaker
fancy smancy, wish i could afford that
ZP5PHQQ    coupon for ¬£70 off e5 plus (
i beleive its his custom printer for enclosing
yeah ill be copying bits and bobs from his printer
and it comes with a pi so its easy to convert to a klipper machine
nearly equal to the cost of my zerog
looks like vez3d printer but the arly bird price is a complete steal
beatiful
fairs
why not do not on the right hand side of the frame and shorten the cable to end facing the camera
Damn looks pretty good
looking pretty slick
oh nice, im not too bothered about sound since ive got a pretty heavy door (fire door) to keep noise out
its just in the settings under experimental or advanced and its really, really good
mines ging on a upside down lack able with braces sitting on top of foam
have you tried krisp noise supression, it filters out my load keyboard, tapping fingers, 3d printer and clicky mouse
lol mines up in my bedroom in the opposite side of the house
In vase mode with a line width of 2mm
26m with 2mm thick walls printed at .2mm layer height
But I will test extensions and see if its worth it
Ah mine are black. I was thinking more bolts and brackets
is it worth polishing some of the metal on my 3d printer for ***aesthetics***
most fancy filaments (peek and pei) are sold in goldend yellow so for the ht filament it shoudlnt be a problem for absorption
oh yeah im using this on my printer, as soon as theres a v6 version
oo lah lah
i only print pla apart from occasional petg
I cant wait to see this
just PID it while the blowers are going at your fist layer speed and its gonna be fine
it should be fine
yeh thats what im gonna do
so that the hevacs is upside down
then try mount it pointing up
or if the enclosure is a problem modifying the duct to mount straight out then bend around the enclosure
well you could have everything custom mount but if not then just have it at front/back
are you good with CAD
let me know how it goes if you build the hevacs
no problem
lemme see if i cant find it
it took me a while t find it
same
i think its on github
High volumetric flow and no need for detailed parts
And I'm the perfect user
Yep
I've @ you because you seemed to know s bit about that kinda stuff
<@179670325351415808>. Do you think the hevacs is worth trying. I have plenty of filament for mounts but I want to adapt it to a Cartesian printer. I'm thinking have it sit inline with the x gantry or on thr back of the y. Does it need to move up with the nozzle or shouod it stay at the bottom
350C on ultra resin with minor cracking
dang
nice, thanks for explaining
so i should be fine if i use a mini usb for power
huh? whats 'pre power reg system'
im using this one cause its 3 bucks and its got a digital display, im powering it over the usb and im testing it on a cheap pi zero
which?
cheers
my stock power supply has some spare slots
would it work ?
Dude, any higher flow wpuld be pointless at .4 nozzle so we wpuld have to make .6 or .8 a standard
Nice, cant wait
ill take a look
I dont want to buy a new hotend but I wanna use the hextrudort
Is the nova hotend interchangeable with the v6
looks pretty good so far
------------Mercury One.1 Beta------------
The Mercury One project is currently transitioning to onshape.
Due to this, we are able to release a view only version of the cad while Mercury One.1 is in beta.
This will not allow downloads due to our release standards.
Feel free to have a look and play around with it.

Please note that the BOM in onshape is incomplete and may contain errors so it is not recommended to use this.


Ender zero g v1, corexy ender 5, nearly done just need to finish my afterburner and fw
Would someone who knows how halbach arrays work mind helping me
anyone have expirience with pull struders or plastic bottle---->filament machines
Im taking a 3d printing break
or if you must a tshirt
try some warm soapy water or ipa and use a microfiber cloth
<@!505382712849465344>
Printers currently down so no reprints
Pa tower, temp tower works at all temps
Crispy
Gimme 5m to go find it
1mm, but disabled for tuning tower
Nop
Bowden
Any other print works beautifully (extrusion wise)
Yeh, had to do a nozzle swap and started reruning  but still everythings underextruding
Awful underextrusion
So ill @u when itsw done
Itll be a while til i get to that
Cool
The heater wires snapped and the heater is stuck in the block
Yup klipper, 2209, skr pro 1.2
Heater stuck, pressure advance doesnt work and i can get the prints to look good, also the classic bed adhesion
Build
I need help getting a custom corexy tuned in and fast
does anyone have a bare-bones v6 mount with no part cooling (or optional part cooling) preferably designed with high speed in mind

its for a voron style corexy belt path and mounts on mgn12h

also @me in a reply please
Also run it as cold as possible
Just remember to put down glue stick to stop it welding to the bed and turn up the flow a little
You got any other good UK sellers/sources for parts
Ah thanks. Ill see if theyre in my price range
How much
WTS London.       Cr10s pro hotend.            Creality brackets and assorted printer parts.          Melzi board
lol, its just ice age the movie but rewritten#
cheers, i managed to plan it. gonna write it layer
Hey Adam how did you start your creative writing peice
thank you
cool
the q4 translations
do you mind sending the latin
No no, I probably should do it but also I'm lazy
Thanks for sending ot
Will do
Thank you
Sorry to ask again but can you send the latin hw whenever you finish it
Yeah true, but a plan is better than none
Thanks
imma email your mom
if you say so
might wanna mention it to her
indeed, youve been doxxed
and email
she sharing ur parents phone number
look at her screen share
f
wot
Congrats. Looking good
I assume its a backplate with screw holes
POGGERS
Wheres my exclusive channel were I get to feel superior
Cheers. Good luck on your build
Man. I nearly died. I wanted my little number so bad and then you just went nope. I even timed it impeccably i had it 6 months on the dot later on the same date and day (different month tho). Thank god I can get it. Any ways whats my number
<@173827530929733632>  my time hath come. 6 months ago on Sunday the 8th I questioned what length linear rail to purchase. And now on Sunday the 8th I request a serial number. A month after v2 released I built my v1. I hit many roadblocks like cost, cost and most of all....cost. But I am finished. Bestoweth upon me my serial number....please
im on bowden and using a hair dryer for cooling abs, im waiting for vez's hevacs
nah mines a v0 so ange will still get his low number
time for a serial request
dang nab it
wait did he get his after the merc came out, also will i be the second ever person with a v0
20 days until the first v0 serial post v2 launch
I agree. If mark is good with ten then 9 is ange 99t
All in favour say 'i'
lol i aint getting that
lookin good
dang that looks good,i think imma hold out for v3 or 69 for a serial#
also dont worry about losjng the touchscreen theres some fw you can get to use most of the screens features
is that your yt?
in which case its no sweat
oh isnt that the same brand as vez uses
You can also use a back converter if you have a spare
So is vezs fan but his is always maxed out in speed and voltage
My fan is like that and is still chugging along
You could run it 50 percent power limited then
Or at half pwm
It will be louder but youay be able to run it 24v
What brand
check the x axis extrusion isnt wobbly
awsome, dming now
this is fully working, correct?
tsa is screwy
they let 3kgs of pc coolers and parts through but not my nerf gun
ill either message you in a sec or in the morning
definitley interested
ill have to ask specific adress since its my brother who would bring it back to the uk but it should be fine
florida
no no, us is good. which part?
oooo, what country are you in <@!232002520547852290>
And make sure theres no play before continuing through the steps
And rails down fully
Triple check the tnuts are fully engaged
just a bit of flexing from not fully tightened screws somewhere, probably around the 2020 extrusion
you will probably be okay and the hardest part is getting the block back on but dont worry just get it on and any balls that fall off can be put back on by half sliding out the block
i will say that i, without any proper equipment, was able to get 3 rails taken apart and back together 4 times within 5hrs
moar cooling a suppose
Or try checking if another motor will work on the same driver and if it's just 2 broken motors
You can try using a multimeter to check this
from the mainboard connector, the outer two pins and inner two pins should make pairs (stolen from maze)
Check the wiring, possible the two innermost wires on the stepper need to be switched
a little custom mount and boom more FOV
could get a fisheye/camera lens for cheap that hjas a similar size to the sensor on this camera
lmao
it saw what my printer went through during its build and decided not to fuck around
funky
or restart it
did you bump it?
yeh, but one stepper assigned x or y is the not working one
wdym one stepper no workie but idk which one it is
X or y
Which is the broken one
DUMP_TMC {Insert stepper config name here}
Already tried the 3b so definitely try the dump TMC command and send the results
might need to add stepper_x at the end
also try DUMP_TMC
whats the buck converter powering
also beleive you can poll the driver and find out if its working, lemme do a bit of googling and get back to you
good, same on my motor, so is the board port broken or the traces to the driver
brb
i spoke too soon, lemme go test on a working one
should be two pairs of connected wires
yup, just make sure you are properly touching the wires
yup
the cables go directly into the motor, no plug at the stepper unfortanutely
why not probe those wires
the stepper connects to the board somewhere, right
you can check continuity in the stepper via the plug btw
no no, is it on but skipping steps or completely off with no holding power
just got here, is it skipping steps?
Don't think it's config. I gotta sleep but try a driver swap real quick
Same for the connecting cable
Can you check that the internal wires of the stepper are intact
And it goes the right distance
imgur
And spares are great for other printers
Belt length is ~6m iirc total, extrusion is 500mm and rails 450 (maybe)
Lol weiner toolhead go brttt
<@!188043401562685450> ^
also does the noise happen on stepper_buzz stepper_x
is the other stepper moving slightly (suuper slowly)
Is your max build area set as a perfect square
Well thats just a silly design. Why not make it the same
also, take your time and make sure everything is tightenied especially the t nuts
make sure you install stops at the end of the rails and make sure the rails are lubed enough
Unless, like me, you get the cheapest of cheap rails (20 bucks for full set) its not worth tearing down
Also i spent a full day mixing grease and trying different combos of block and rail
Pre load ones or nah
Fair enough
And if you're bothered a full teardown before reassembly never hurt
Make sure to get all the bearings and channel when you do it
You can also try diesel but not on the coloured plastic
I used acetone wich is unabvisable since ipa iis safer
Yup
Good luck
If you're really bothered i would get the thickest possible and the thinnest possible (of the same brand) and try mix them to make a grease to your liking (plus the thick one can be used on leadscrews)
Gotta ask <@!451709396280410132>  to weigh in on that one, cant remember if its this or graphite greases that chew through bearings
The lower the ep number the thinner it is asnd the more often you need to reapply
You could also try the smaller boxes and get a few greases from ep1 to 2 and a oil or get a ep3 and light machine oil and try a custom mix
Seems like the first two are very similar one uses a different rating system
Look at last sentence
It looks like ngli has the consistency of thick peanut butter
So ngli is just a standardized measure and both should be the same with yellow being rated for high pressure
Seems the green one isnt high pressure rated
EP 2 grease is a NLGI Grade 2 and it is fortified with Extreme Pressure (EP) additives
<@!372807604331741194>
No no
Afaik ones in a tin the other isnt
Link?
If its different brand then its just stylistic choice assuming specs are similar/same
If its from the same brand i would check if theres any difference it might be an indicator
I was gonna get a pink grease but it was more expensive
Nope
Different, ptfe will be better for high speed but may require a bit more maintenance, ep2 you put it in run the rails back and forth and your done
Yup, ive greased every conceivable hinge and bearing and barely made a dent
Also local store
500g at ¬£5
For the amount my ep2 lithium cost it wasnt bad at all
And the bearings got the dry stuff
The rails were wiped down in machine oil/grease mix
Fajreinheit
U got a euro car parts store near you
Its what im using
And a oil/grease/ptfe mix on the lin rails
Dry wd ptfe lub
for ht printing bowden may be more sensible tho
ive got it, its not bad but i would prefer dd, boths have pros and cons
But recently people have been trying kinematic beds
Nah bed is up to you, so is bed
Usually
And you can use the same screen wich will look near identical to marlin
Klipper replaces marlin but you can still use the sd slot
Ive had some success on .8 and 1.2 nozzles but arachne cura is a must
m3
Mb I'm sure it could be modified though. o
<@834399728719626261>
It will. I can show you a photo of where to cut if it helps
Mercury. I'm fairly certain its compatible
Solder on some wires and tada
Theres one on the github. X axis ensdtop. You just desolder or cut off the switch of the endstops and unscrew it
I dont beleive it matters too much I screwed mine down and put my printer to the home position and adjusted the lin rails til they were just long enough to allow full movement
For an extea touch check out this 
At just saw that. Tpu bracket. Air intake tube. Thicc id tubing and enclosure
Travel 25k 200mm/s ( using stealthchop)
Just not print
So could it
Stock enders with good tuning can on travel
Probably
So its apeice of junk]
It isnt
But alas
Thats not terrible if it were cheap
No sparks
Nah its alum
So if you design it right and do it clever its maybe 10 bucks
Mass production drives cost down and upgrade kits cost that
Less
Hmmmmmmm#
Hm
Thanks for the tip
Time to rebuild with my new screws
Mine does that
Oh shit
Huh, at what speed
Lmfao
Bruh the the file is named smol boy
Phew
Magnum+?
Pog
I forgot to do the transparent backround
Lol, i spent more than a year building this mod (im slow at building) and i started the conversion because i couldnt screw down a carriage properly
Stl?
Or just heavyier frame
Tuned pendulum time?
Have fun
Tinkercad ha sone built in, its fairly simple, just type in 3 numbers and voila
Psh, silly billy, for true accuracy use tinkercad
Nah, hit up nitram for his volcano mosquito block and use his + generic heatsink and genuine heatbreak for ultimate ccombo
Talk to the people in the rebreather channel at annex
Lol i got plugins
Lol idc what language its in, I KNOW THEM ALLLL
Nice edit
Shhh
rAcIsT, cUlTiSt, ElItIsT tHe LoT oF yOu
If you got the money for it im happy to bring it with
A what now? <@!451709396280410132>
I hear europe is a great time to travel, so ill take 50 or so spools, right?
No worries, i will take them free of charge
I actually liked mine, it want terrible
The tl v6 has been nothing but perfecct for me, solid choice if you can justify it over a dragon or other similar hotends, personally i would wait for olivers hotend olypics to release
Hehehdheh.....that's what she said
If you mean the clicking then its just a high pa value. You'll benefit from a shorter tube or a more rigid tube (but shorter is better)
Pog
Uh. May as Well try it
If that fails i think ( <@!451709396280410132> )  we can just rotate a x5sa frame and rebuild the z
Yup
The guide is in pdf form, and maybe video if anyone makes one (its not planned though)
Thats what i did pretty much
True. My merc costed just under 300 including e5
This is a fraction of the cost
Voron is 1k or more if made to spec
When rotated^
In that case just cut the rails so they just fit into the frame
Well if osmeone can load the cad and check rail length theres a travel optimized version of the printer and you could potentially use thta and the longer rails to get more usable space
You could keep them longer and have them just fit between the motors and idlers
How long
Congrats
Yep
Just pull on the belts by the idlers on one side and watch it change
When the belts pull it out of square the rails seize up and it gets stuck
And that theres no racking
Accounting steppers, just to check its fairly even
Grab the veryfront end and leave just enough to get a firm grip i guess
I suppose you could tuck them in the probe area but you will have tio trim some of it
Can it move freely
Looking good
Ohh, just enough to hold between your fingers to hold it in place
Or run the belt for just one side and measure it with slack and do a second the same way
Then measure out 4.5m then cut in 2 just for peace of mind
Cut them equally and trim the excess later, the more there is to pull on and tension the better time youll have, mine were exactlyto size and i had to use pliers to hold them in place and it was a pain in the ass
Its went fine tbh, although i swapped it for a printed adapter later on
I cut mine
Cool
Ive got one of these, which side do you use to lapp
Damn
Pic?
Try baking it at 140 sandwiched between 2 glass panels and then let it cool in the oven
Its working pretty well
I got mine flat
<@!398242299080867842> ^
My bad
Ah wrong person then
<@!206880729509003265>  is your fr4 still warping
I got mine for the heater for my chamber or for a big fan and for a motorized front panel
Hehe
Define it as a zboard
Get the stock board out and use it for z and extra ports
I know. Its just to try out. If ot doesn't work ill cut some mirrors to size
Why, its cheap and I like the texture. How, I just slap it on the print bed
Nah ivw got fr4
Really? And those work on non metal plates
I don't have any probe so unless I do manual mesh I may as Well attempt it
If it works lmk
Ah cool
Do you have a link to a guide on lapping a plate
Looks like a 350 could fit with 10mm removed or without and just use the maximized space mod
higher speed at same or better quality
chhers
goo gone?
ill try heaqt it and pull it
yup
only 2 small bubbles
nice, ill reccomend that
also how do i remove the stock mag sticker
what do i do before usinga new pei sheet
is galileo using the idential orbiter parts
whered you get the orbiter mount
Just dont go too big or else belts get ridiculously long
You could make the frame as big as you like and just purchase any size linear rails and belts and z rods
since its a liquid when it touches the build plate it sticks in every nook and cranny and sticks really well, a flex plate makes bits much easier to remove
Or possibly a orbieter
Looks like a sherpa modded afterburner
as long as you can mount it you could do anything with any featuresw, i dont know of aqny pre existing designs but if youre better with your hands than in CAD its super easy to vut some foam to size
you could do it with 2020 or with insulation sheets or just print something
you mean a raised edge
Oh my god what a disservice and crime against the designs thats a terrible idea. You must keep the printer pure to the intended desigb
Hn, aliexplress might have 1mm washers (I recommend stainless steel)
Where are you located
Got mine from ACCU UK they sell shims and such
Well theres a few unnoficial floating around with a official soon to arrive
Hey welcome to the discord, let us know if you have any questions or need help
I run 80 max for abs and for pls run a 350 max with 250 max print speed
Looks as good as the reviews say
Lol
Tell us how it goes
Nice
ill be running mine with a step dwon on a 48v psu
Do it
But you can always adjust them manually
Yeh. If its too tight you can sand the pin slightly
As long as the bearing moves its all good, if yours are easy to clean and regrease you could open and clean them then use dry ptfe to get them to spin freely
They should be held well and if they're using the factory grease they wont spin freely
Lol ive done that a couple timew when I was in a pinch, its not great for vslot wheels but to build something relatively short its not awful imo
Right so a rigid but long set of arms would be optimal
I thought longer arms gave morw speed at worse stability
mines barely a touch, theres so little force if tuned well and following the documentation
Hey this is feedback and after enough feedback we get full release potentially including .step and bom
nah i dont think its theere yet
nice
just push down and keep hands clear
take a sharpened putty knife or cheap pocket knife to the edge for a diy chamfer
bottom layer?
looks really clean
presumably
but theres no data on longevity with that stuff compounded with the fact that thats gonna be fairly loud so for someone who isnt chasing speed a light oil or thin grease would be best bet with superlube being a good middle ground and thick ep2 being a nice quiet alternative
but if you want it to be quieter youre gonna need some thicker grease (i have a ep2 that isnt too thick when mixed with a smidge of oil but it works fine without the oil) or for speed use dry ptfe lube from wd40 (make sure it says dry)
sounds reasonable for a good all round printer but i would reccomend avoiding wd40, its alright but a longer soak in iso should be fine
far easier to overtighten since they need more force to screw on iirc
only by 5 or so mm
i suppose just adding spacers on all the printed merc parts that interact with the belts would do it
thats why i want to use a small 10x10x1 cf tube and mount it as high as possible and have the hotend sit as high up as physically possible, that way the bed moves further up and boom easy vision
Ah cool. Thats pretty good
What acceleration
But I'm no abs pro I know nephimulos does only ABS and most others dabble in it often
Well your petg should be fine as long as hotend stuff is abs/abs+ just keep something roughly 30c but higher is better personally I just best the bed and wait 10m then print and go nice and slow with minimal cooling
What speed?
Obviously if I said I found a second hand ssr on eBay for 5 bucks and im using it to power my ac bed you would all strongly discourage it and point out better and safer alternatives
But strongly discouraging it and pointing out better alternatives because theyre too stupid is ok. But non constructive feedback is useless
Yep
But I thoroughly check first
Also I use Reddit only when I'm stumped and internet doesnt have answers
I think while anyone can use a servo. Not everyone can SAFELY use it. I think its a case of strongly advised against for safety
wow okay time to jusdt change your name and great were all done
only v0 in the world
oh great
is that a serial request
oh hey look over there
just set it off to print a quick square so i can obtain title as the only person in the world with a zero g v0
serial timeee
nice
poggers
Sorry man. Got a littl3 carried away and definitely obnoxious. Just because my printer is barely supported doesn't mean everyone elses has to be As well
have you tried scrubbing it really well with a sponge and water until its not smooth or 'slimy'
but i can grab and touch my bed all day without any loss in adhesion
Nah its a great solution. I've nevee knocked a print off the bed or lost power (my fault most od the time) and had to worry about power loss recovery not working or my part falling off the bed
I have my stock creality sticker from late 2019 that still grips prints a little too hard
If you clean it properly then it lasts a while
Nah buildtak knockoff is where its at. Just slap that shit on anything and get printing
I was referring to the pre sliced models and profiles designed for their filaments and the user that needs those to print shouldnt (or wouldn't) get to far into the hobby
I heard they were working on a corexy wich is good but I worry its gonna be some orange petg voron knockoff
And pre sliced files are nice but the i3 is a outdated design that needs to be put down
But that type of person shouldn't be 3d printing
I see the appeal for a certain type of person
ah, i though you were gonna decommision it, phew
thats a small hdmi screen for a touchscreen interface called klipperscreen. imagine fluidd/mainsail but better and always connected
are you dissassembling your v2
looking good
Forgot about that. Ill re assmble and check its square tomorrow. Thanks for the tip
Yeah those are the cheaper alternatives
Or in my case. Small book that looks quite flat
Or carpenters square
Or speed square
I gotta get some of those. Then I can have double brackets
ayyy..... same
lucky, ive spent the last day iterating my 2020 delete, also wish i had that kind of hardware, best i can do is a dremel and wood saw
Oh dang. That bed looks nice
Is idiot taken
Hm
+1
i think hes decided to fork the voron github and make his own set of VORONS
no hes making a custom VORON
Fat fingers. Meant 261. I got no mgic sauce (yet)
iget 258 on x and 271 on y (soon to be more)
Oh well. In getting new ones soon anyways
Or something isnt screwed on well enoufh
The vibration from the motors
So its either linear rails
Did that
Yes
Do like a tldr of the tldr
Well I might have done it and not remeber
What did you say
No no. Without tuned drivers and before I started messing around it sounded weird
At low speeds my y sounds funny
Try a higher speed
Building and flashing the micro-controller- from this heading
you gotta follow this guide
i hear pouring acteone on a fire is like pouring water on burning oil, it puts fires out immediately and is a great idea
mmmm acetone fumes
i got mine in 2019 and the e5 in 2020
lol
lol
lol i only started last year, but i did get a motor mount to melt after setting a pancake stepper (0.5A rating) to run at 2A max
Good job
Cuz the way I do it is just turn the threaded object into a cutting block and put a tube in it and cut
Photo?
As in wrong threads or siz3
In what way
Ive been building for more than 6 monthd
Lol you think that's slow
<@126409155299770368>. No don't use cable chains, just use wire wrap, less resistance and it goes directly to the hotend and imo looks cleaner
Pog
Mine are screwed to a peice of cardboard but daaaamn nephy your wiring is just mwah compared to mine, I see why y'all were concerned, next holidays ill get din rails and fix it
freezes for 10m but does it
eh mine does it
so good
wow look how fast its going
did you hear that or do you need me to speak up
the future is now old man
a kid with a faster printer than you
Ok BoOmEr, DiD yOu FoRgeT yOuR HeArInG aId
I SAAAID 'MY PRINTER SKIPS STEPS BETTER THAN  YOURS MOVED'
hey my 2021 build can skip steps faster than you can say astronomically
what a speed demon
if you do it right theyre really good
Ahhh, never heard of it called that before
Hey. Were did you get a photo of my printer from
backlash, never heard of it. any ways guys my axis move ~10mm with the motors on- it looks kinda loose
oopsie, now, whats the mass ban button do
i think i put 10A instead of 0.01A
angel?
youe making me look bad
psh
i wanna be a mod
mod
learn later
do first
no
what speed
And if you remove the pulley On the stepper and do a diagonal does it make the same noise
Or just one
On both motors diagonal
Hmm mines silent on diagonal
Then fiddle with pwm and see if the annex server are interested in tuning spreadcycle
Anywho ive gotta get to bed, ill get my serial tmrw and try some faster prints and tune in the speed
Guess ill drop it down a notch
And geared
Stock extruder motor
Should probably reduce that
And my extruder is too hot to touch at all
And the stepper with the lower pwm value is getting real toasty and the one with the higher is barely warm
Its like that hiss but louder
And the motor with high pwm is cooler
Also theres a hissing noise I cant get rid of
I dunno why on diagonal moves its silent and on others its squeaky
I wouldnt have though to use dump tmc or use the auto tunr
100 percent helpful
And compare wrong values with no set value with the correct value
I need to get out my thermistors
Although I have no actual data
But theyre much cooler than before
Less skipping. Only skipped at long moves so I need to lower the maximum speed since it did fine on small changes 8n direction
So I'm gonna try tune that out
But they still make a loud 'chirping' noise at lower speeds
And 4 to 14
I went from 6 to 45 for the grad
I did dump tmc and set all the pwm values in my config and the steppers are cooler and so are the drivers
Good news
Ill ask in the annex server later
Good luck
Nudge nudge
True if you wanna check it out
Oh?
but page 67 has the quickstart guid
and i understand none of it
theres a lot there
ive been reading the data sheet
delta? a positive delta of 80 degrees
interpretation
so the value must be closer to your printers motors
no no i just wanna try contribute something in the annex discord and race for a benchy and we have perfectly good drivers now, but no one tunes them
well ill do some tests for speed with and without it and with improper tuning
ill definetly do that, duh
well its there for a reason and these are used in more professional environments so before i go finding servos ill tune this like a professional
also if its easy it may be worth making it common practice
speeeeeed
does it work for spreadcycle or just stealthchop
so i enable stealthchop and input pwm_grad_auto then copy the values and put it in to the pwm grad thingy
thank you, i barely understand their data sheets
well if i can use this for stealthchop at high speed i may aswell
ah, exactly what i did
makes sense why mine is boiling
ooh, so itsw for tuning spreadcycle or stealthchop
hence the question in annex
true, but if theres speed to be gained then i may aswell take it
2209 and the grad six i dont know about
nah i put it on klipper but it may affect the driver, what would it do there
driver_PWM_GRAD: 6
all i entered into the cfg was that line
good question
so idk
my print was accurate with it tho
cant tell
so it may be worse
no clue but it made my steppers hotter but i havent tested speed
yeah its meant to get your steppers to go faster and gain some torque but idk
well within their operating temp
wish i had one of those
driver_PWM_GRAD: 10
and thank you
no problem
i think im gonna have to, can you try running a print wih this line in your config and tell me if the motors get hotter than usual
nah 20mm/s i think its the pwm thing ive set
already got some, the steppers are 80% under max current and are getting really toasty
true, i suppose you want z motors to be the same as running, x and y to be just high enough and extruder doesn't matter
on my extruder i have it set to .2
does hold current really need to be high, its just used when its not moving
I have the pwm_grad at 10
Is that bad
My steppers are getting too hot to touch
Its far cheaper than good leadscrews
From 5 to 8mm
F, spacer for the y pulleys?
<@451709396280410132>. Not a single part has tolerances so you'll need to overhaul it wich if you do can you send me the stl
Cause not much else available will melt it
Heat?
I don't think so, you just have a keep out zone in the slicer and multiple printers with different zones. Then when you get a macro that turns on different heaters and put it in the start gcode
Cartesian wouls be most simple bur crossed gantry has very little flex and has short belts
Also, do large format printers use Cartesian or crossed gantry
Or they could be like me and go brrrr 50k accel weeeeeee
why not different heated zones for power efficiency
nice, finally taking down the v0
Ah. Welp my internets good enough for what I need anyways, and my ping is usually sub 5
And I can stream 8k video at 60
But discord never lags
I get 180 on a good day
Wait. You guys get 600 MB/s
My old car was 30 cent per cylinder
Dang. That's high quality
Yup they swore on it
they promised it was high quality too
psh, imagine not trusting a ¬£30 v12 engine
kindly inform them theres cheaper options but dont be upset if they buy 'premium'
Very very high
would a counterweight on the z be at all beneficial
interface
same, thankfully im moving it to my cr10s pro to replace its shit screen
lol klipper doesnt support the tft unless you only use it in lcd mode
same as cr10s pro, its so shit
just do what im doing and buy a cheap aio pc and and use its 24'' touch screen to control the printer
Is silicone wire not flexible
Also get a ferrule set
I just reccomend silicone for its flexibility
Make sure yoy get silicone wire and more than you need
Its thick enough to work for what I need
16awg is what I've got
Not for speed at all
Its heavy weight and modular
Its best for cr10 style printers
i may use that carriage then when i get a nema14 and mosquito
and the knockoffs right
does your carriage have a groovemount
yeah its really lopsided
yup
and the bottom are for the probe
the top 2 are for zipchains
a probe slots in to the cavity and a separate carrige is screwed in to the middle set of holes
thats the afterburner right
less resisitance]#
yeah so i remove 1 shield and put the 2 bearings together
i can remove the inner shield on both and re grease then close them so its closer to sealed then completely open
the flange bearings are like to halves right
its dry grease so dust is no problem and im just gonna buy the open version
once the seal is off it wont go back on but i can remove it without killing the bearing
i just dunno if i need an actual ultrasonic cleaner or use a dental one
i wanna try remove their grease and use dry ptfe
well, polished brass is fairly snazz
also is it worth getting an ultrasonic cleaner (small one) for bearings/linear rails blocks
ah, i see
that sounds much better
ooh
it looks cooler
i may build one with cf
how large do pannels need to be for the mercury one to be enclosed
<@173827530929733632>. If you make it ill print and use it, I prefer the more open look it has
nice
looks like he applied rotational force from the center of the big hole
i wonder if a skeletonised version would be stronger
thats no good
yikes
only stl for now, full cad will be released when we leave beta
v6
ive got 2 days to do the sherpa
ah thats for tomorrow, i spent today getting my toolhead installed and relaxing
im hunting wabbits
its free and far faster unless you have a really good workstation
use simscale
how are you doing them
ooh nice, simulations
nah just put a support beam from the middle 2 cicles down to the bar by the belts
and rotating a bracket can make it tons more rigid
yah its kinda wacky how holes cand be stronger than solid plastic
yeah i keep some drv8825s in a drawer incase i need them (and they run on 48v wich is nice) and ill be getting some 5160's to put on my board so ill even have 2209's spare
I thought it was given out to everyone in the server right before release
Wait is it actually
Active talking
Ah yes
Ive been eyeing up this mod since late 2019 or mid 2020 and joined before the v2 release
You aren't an og or have a printer, dunno if ur a tester or designer or admin tho
but the bearings will last longer since they are sealed and are better for the belts
you can also opt for the cheaper idlers instead of flange pulleys and they are 8mmOD and 5mm ID
flange bearings= 5mm NOT m5
20t=stepper shaft (usually 5mm)
the bearings or the 20t
if in doubt check the pdf instructions
but there is a unofficial bom, lemme find it <@!164576628163346433>
so theres nothing official since we dont wanna reccomend anything hardware wise that may become outdated
if its by the hotend i reccomend a zip tie to connect to the ptfe tube and anything that needs to routed can be zip tied underneth a screw
where?
New belts yada yada
Ita been a while since ive seen the vid
My bad guys
Like cnxkitchens cf nylon wich creeped
Could still creep
Because if so you may have to change wich way you print your towers
Is it plastic creep
4-5m
just run on ac
or get new capacitors and run 38/40v
board and steppers can be used but thats about it afaik apart from wiring heaters and bed and frame
cant relate
imagine not 120k accel
sure
ik but a slow 5400rpm with 5-10tb isnt terrible
hm, sounds like a good way to use old slow hdd
but someone has a unnoficial one
no official BOM
why not buy some drv8825 and wire it to a stepper geared down and one of them rotatio to linear movement things and build a scraper
pog
or a row of 10
jet engines
24v on them fans
ooo
delta 24v
thats the plan
try a hevacs style system
if anything, better adhesion
at high speeds
run abs at 310 or pla at 270
ik i just use the flamboyant for looks, but i do plan on building a simple versipon
and magnum+ arriving soon
low inductance is more important than torque tho, as long as theres enough torque more want help
i just want speed tbh, thats why i want 125k acc
you must be doing it wrong
wait your toolhead doesnt weigh 5kg
im hoping to use 4wd servos
speeeed
lol im waiting for 4wd, and im prepareed to wait 1+ year for it
lol have patience man
well i can test all this once i get to v2, i can test rigning with just about tight enough belts and over tight belts
Well do some jerky and fast moves and watch the printer wiggle then rigid mount it and watch the frame tremble
Or you allow the printer to move and shake wich dissapates energy. Also you may laugh at the mass damper but I plan on using one
Time to install a mass damper
Off
But I can test when I get my printer working I test with my brackets on and pn
If the toolhead or motion system is at all loose you get ringing
If everything is solid then it moves as a unit and keeps ringing at bay
No
yep  a vaccum and for thermal conductivity submerge the printer in liquid mercury
the ridges create air resistance and slow down the printer, should probably get better parts, obviously
yeah top down lighting is never flattering on anything
its wobbly
no no, look at the x axis on the left
dang thas a lot of z wobble
60 printers til i get my serial
im exact opposite
ive had 2 functional printers this whole time
dangf yall are fast, i spent 3+ months on physical assembly and im finally adding a mainboard and extruder and building my own hotend
including modifications are ok, just no sporks
can i modify the spoon at all, or what are the rules
oh, is that a challenge, i will video and timelapse it
had nothing else
yep
i used a knife and it was awful
use a fine toothed saw or a mechanical saw
Thats the plan
Lol qnd here I am knowing ill get number 50+
speeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed
i think imma use 2 volcano blocks connected by a hacked apart nozzle to get a super long heat zone and use 2 heaters in series or parallel powered by relay of sorts or mosfet (dunno which is best)
now i just need to stop the heatbreak from snapping
wanna hear about my custom hotend
nice
not sure, mine go next to my heatsink fan
im thinking ¬£5
<@!173827530929733632>  how much do i need to pay you to use HTD3M 10mm belts and a mg carrige plus custom hotend and 8wd plus hevacs style cooling with servo motors and a sub ¬£100 BOM
well ther would be no resistance sooo
i prefer that, its less cluttered
front idlers become motor mounts
please
i see, the merc uses a few by the motors right and keeps the front clear of belts but with more idlers. i think for the most speed we gotta drop some idlers and live 2 front and back but keep the clear front
wdym convoluted, whats different from a normal one?
ah true, im not near any ware houses
depends how close you are to a warhouse, for me its closer to ¬£20 per kilo depending on what part but that looks right to me
fairly certain unless you buy it all from one shop then it doesnt matter
adios
welp
ugh and ive got a science test from a useless science teacher who teaches fuck all, a history test and a math test
welp im off, with school and all that, see yall tomorow
especiialy a nylon one for less friction
eh its fine skill is skill
good luck man, just show them a assortment of parts youve designed and im sure youll get the job, even if you have to fudge a little
unfortunately i have to do 'jewish education' since i go to a jewish school so i cant even take all the subjects i want but i have to do a few others that are completely irrelevant to what i wanna do
are they fucking stupid
no choice, england makes you take a shit ton of exams
dang i rember being so jelly of my bro for getting a few months off to study but he didnt do to well with no structure to life
englands been so fucking screwy with the exams, mine are next year and while i would benefit from this new system i still prefer the exams they used to do
good luck, those are a pain
i had one designed that used vslot wheels (12 of them) that would work in tandem with the stock z and used the same steps per mm and all that shabang but i never got round to printing it
if the 9mm belt bersion also comes with AWD then hell yah
but that house was in bumfuck nowhere and 8miles away from a shop
yeah, when i was in kansas my house was worth 120k and was proper mansion sized with 3 spare bedroom (8 total) and walk in closets with enough room to walk around in plus a basement and walk in safe and backyard and a roof so high you needed scafolding to change lightbulbs. nowadays a tiny flat costs 1-5mil in london
on the secind floor, i fucking hope not
so ive got to drill it out and patch it
and theres a hole in my wall but i have no clue how it was made as its not cylindrical or straight
mine was built in ww2 so its not very modern or pretty, its identical to every other house on my road
dang that house looks nice
same, choggers
any allotments near you
my bedroom is alright for now but everything gets stuck in the carpet and i dont like sleeping in wood dust
i got it second hand too
its really just a really large shed that i bought and wired up with ethernet and heating and power
and my room barely has space for my printers
all my stuff goes in my room or eventually my summer house
ah fair enough
but i do reccomend a wood working lathe, theyre fairly cheap and tons of fun. but a printer pen is more sustainable, pro tip for those pens-get some cooling if you can or just tell them to run at the lowest temp possible or else it just oozes and falls over. and for the love of god, get one that pulls the filament through for you
<@!173827530929733632>  if the nut is free to move in the x and y axis but not rotationally then you would eliminate wobble while keeping all functionality
dang lucky, im not allowed pets, i have too many responsibilities and my parents work from home so it would be awful to leave them to take care of it
if its in bang bang mode it can cause the bed to expoand and contracty but it looks like your good, have you tried a oldham coupler on the brass nut
good, if they were preteen i would reccomend a 3d printer/cnc/lathe
pid tune your bed
how old are they
F
just wait til he gets some frogs and youll have to start printing them little harneses and signs that say 'it is wednesday my dude'
although that tadpole tank should get some acetone smoothed abs prints
tanks have treads, not propellers
wonderful
but i applaud the efficiency
self burn
no thats patrick
oh, so i was way off, i translated that your tinder match walked today and the cat got cancelled
ayyyy
<@!141593844788494336> im still so confused, google translate agrees with my translation
doggers?
psh, dinosaur
hey its for scale
damn dutchdude, beating a dead horse huh
right
i assume the song is representative of your culture
your just proving my point, so uh, this is what your everday is like right
it sure is a.....gem
dang your house is nice
not this again
my uh dutch is failing me or did maze get orange cream puffs, dutchdude's gym is small and crazy angle's cat got cancled?
f
ohhhhhh
bruh im confused, what do you mean then
is this a vr thing or a UK thing
the company is kinda crappy tho
their vr headsets arent bad
nice
also whats its cfm and pressure output
better put some red stripes on it for performance
just wait for vez to do it, ill be helping him design it soon so i can share it here how the design is going
or a vzbot hevac style duct
yep, thats why i skipped the cooling and am building a hevacs
Yup, you havr to orient the block correctly too
especially the 2.2 hotend
they may haqve a superiority complex but the afterburner is quite nice
thankfully my build should be sub ten since im building the very OG version, then ill be building v2 with optimizatins for speed
soon as i can imma be building tons of printers
yeah im not allowed to get a job yet
dang your fast, i started my build at the end of 2020 and still dont have a serial
also apply some in the race and move it around
nice
these are just the ones ive seen used succesfully
you can use ep2 litium grease, dry ptfe lubricant, light machine oil, superlube or dry (if you're using ceramic bearings)
nice
Right
Crazy
Hahaha
Imagine using a ssr for your hotend
what idiot though putting fets on the bottom is a good idea
why
wut
well i can add a fan on top to cool the physical fet
so assuming a 80w maximum on thr hotend and the stock e5 bed + delta fan should i get a ssr
also it says it arrives in 1 month and i can wait
wait why a ssr and mosfet, cant it power them on its own
446 or 407
<@!179670325351415808>  wich onw were you waiting for
whatsa the best board available right now
alright, boards officially dead, killed the 5v and the ship sunk with it
Nice. I wonder if its worth getting one that's perfectly long enough for e5
Nah. Robotdigg is nice but see what's cheapest or use vorons vender or these
dope
uh oh
which parts
nice
best i got was at accu for 15 pounds but only for bolts longer than 25mm
yep
you can source the parts now but dutchdudes avoided reccomending anything incase it becomes obsolete soon
gotta wait til full alpha release
not yet
Or try tightening with a newton wrench
Duh
Easiest fix it to just print the x axis on a 0.05mm nozzle
<@!244874310592757771>  youve built it right, any clue?
not sure
nice
but the best brand is RUTHEX
wich is how they will be loaded in this printer
something like these are the best designed inserts for pull out strength
also whats your budget like
get the non rotating tnuts since they save a ton of effort and the m3 inserts i recommend a variety pack so you can use them for future projects
ah no problem
cant find anything about those, are they any good
whats 9001
these are gonna be awsome
looks like 5160's and a step up vmot board for 48v would be really good
ah ill look it up
how much modified
ah no sensorless homing, but also what issues do they have
True
It would be insane, and the torque
I cant wait to do 4 motors on 5160s, just imagine the speed I could get
Should be quieter with better toqur huh
The current part is good but lemme know if theyre louder or have a massive flaw
<@451709396280410132>. Can you tell me if the 5160s are worth it. I'm considering them for the same steppers you have but on 4wd
Dang mine are cool to touch after 15 rounds of the x test at 350mm/s 100k acceleration
this for example is 50 bucks and already upgraded for reliability
second hand printers are where its at
petg is easier to print and ive used it, its not bad its just a bit heavier and less stiff
abs is lighter and more heat resistant
make tiny stipling across one axis to make it shake, or tiny waves
true
that looks dope, what about a bearing? or slot for a belt
but i was running pleunes x test and the printer divebombed off the bench
ive just gotta get my hotend screwed in and the rest of my extruder working
nah my extruder wont go together, ill be canibalising my other printer until a replacement arrives
and 350mm/s
ah ive got mine at 125k
what acceleration
ive got 2 other printers for printing reliably, my mercury needs to be shaking my walls or its not going fast enough
yeah i want to get a sub 10m benchy minimum
lol ive opened mine up way too many times
hevort seemed to be using it quite well and it moved really smoothly
ah, thats what i got, im migrating to a dry grease for everything, and cermic bearings for my flanges/idlers too
is ep2 better
same for all my bearings, ill be using the dry grease on bearings too, so that any bearing can glide
and some dry ptfe spray
if they work imma be buying them
yeah im waiting on doug for his review
it does look like it, ill upload to youtube a vid of it moving in the morning
dang i can do it up to 180k at 300mm/s but the motors get toasty af
mine are the stock ones and they do that up to 350mm/s
no more 125k acc
my printer is gonna be zoooooooming, do i need 4 identical motrs or can they be different
i will build the mercury as soon as my v0 works if you do that
tube seems best, a clamp with a hole seems least effort
use 3d printed clamps with heat inserts, epoxy them to the tube
Yes. Eva is meant to be modular
ill be starting as soon as my v0 can print
Thats a site to rival the voron
That looks downright professional
Good enough?!?
once those parts arrive, yes, currently though mercury one has not released, quick fyi you will need endstops if you wanna use 2208 they cannot sensorless home and that tft35 will only work in 'marlin mode' with this firmware (
released refers to the printed parts, you will need to print out a assortment of .stls and find a toolhead thats compatible with mgn12h, you'll also need to purchase idlers,belts,screws, a control board+drivers (optional) and a ras pi
<@!451709396280410132>  ^
what speed and accel
ahh i see
Just noticed the server is still called zero g, should probably change that to mercury 1
üëç
ahh, so i higher brush or finer brush tip would be the solution, i think?
looking good, it just looks like you need to lower the z height a bit
so @me for help
welp ill be up for the next 2.5 hrs
good luck
yep
<@!402169283167256589>  you'll need to change, driver sensitivity, axis length, speed settings, microstepping settings
oh yeah his z isnt 100k, i just saw it and laughed at the fact his leadscrew can even manage those speeds
that z speed is fairly reasonable, right
it works quite well at 100k i did try at 3k and it felt so sluggish compared to 100k
square_corner_velocity whats a good value for this, i assume whatever the feed rate is but idk
ah, so its how quick i can slow down, it should be roughly half of my accel then
what does accelerate to decelerate  mean anyways
that can be arranged
Very conservative settings, right?
<@173827530929733632>. Thanks for the link.  Are those printer limits the reccomended limits for a standard build
Thanks
Ah must of been someone else while you were helping that gave me a number
Also with microstepping at 64 with interpolation theres a hissing noise, is there a way to get rid og that
But I am going to use it to play music, ill link q vid of that if I get it to work
Also I tried 2x microstepping and it sounded terrible
Cool. So I assume the value you gave was the safe one
Also creality 42-40 steppers are rated for 1.5a how would I set that in my config
Quick question: can I completely disable microstepping and how can I increase the voltage to my steppers e.g up to 35v
yep it sucks for klipper
oh, yah
yeah octoprint is best for a cartesian printer with a low speed
the zero w should just be ¬£5 but its usually 15
Now you can cheap out on certain things but some items its best to get something good, e.g the pulleys that go on the motor. But pins you can buy the cheapest set and same for bearings (just buy extra in those in case of a bad one)
Its gonna be very cheap for you to upgrade.sub 50 I would say. As long as you buy cheap all you need is screws, flanged bearings, belts, ras pi 0 (or better), and whatever hotend and extruder combo you choose
nah its more futur proofing than anything else
they have it like that so that they can do non planar printing, it has a massive range of movement
<@!500079262460674059>  do you know the axis length for x and y on v1
I was originally gonna use the z motor to replace the stock y motor and use the stock y motor on a dual beltes z run off one stepper
Im part way through designing a belted z that will run in series with the leadscrew, eventually ill make it independent from the other motor
oh you mean m5x30 size pins
no but they use m5x30 screws
p.s these can be pulled from the stock e5 from the vslot wheels (i think the bearings can also be made into flanged bearings with a 3d print)
try aliexpress, buy extras of everything in case you get a bad bearing
i wish, most ive seen was during live streams when it was early development
private alpha
but v2 is nearly out of alpha
we have a working v1 but the v2 is far far far far far superior
yes?
fair enough, just doesnt work too well for my setup
yeah so one is controllable and the others are always on
unless im terribly mistaken
i think so
true but only one controllable
welp, fair enough, theres just a lack of ports when it comes to fans
The 1.4 imo is garbage for klipper
Why not buy some 2209
Why 1.4
shnazzy
ooooo
why add more failure points and potentially more money
or HT steppers for simplicity if cost isnt a problem
yeah it is
and they'll max out your step rate faster but its unlikely you could go fast enough to do that anyways
From small atomic bombs to large nuclear bombs
Big change
Oh wow
No it means we are near a nuclear war. I don't see how a nuclear weapons manual= cad release
100%
nah definitely preparation for nuclear warfare
explosives?
but its probing onto ~6-12mm of metal
its just the defualt cr10s pro probe
best is 0.0002 but that was over 100 probes on the flattest part of my bed
thankfully the worst i got on my inductive probe is 0.005
plenty good
and what amperage
are they 1.8 or 0.9 degree
M48 P10 X100 Y100 V2
thank you
how do i test that
ah, much better up top then
hey dutch dude was upside down not feasible or not worth the effort if this already works
ahhh
ah good
is that the smallest bend radius possible
lol, some ebay printers are 500x500 and second hand are ¬£40
psh, peasant numbers. i use a 450x450 setup
Oh sorry. Thought you meant v1. Thr tightening plate sticks out same as motor mount and maybe the x by a tiny bit. Probably @ dutchdude for his build
it sticks out by a few mm, ill send a shot in 5 ish minutes
Yeah me neither, v2 looks really good
Fair enough, I can still participate in the discord tho with my build, right?
Fair enough, I wanted to steal the lightweight x axis to use on my v1
Oh well
Dang
Can I ise x axis v2 with the v1 parts or are the belt paths different
The x axis I meant
Are the v2 x idlers compatible with v1 or is it completely different
ive used up to 1,2mm and the absolute most important thing is good coioling and getting retractions perfected. line width i used .72 for a .6mm and for the top i use a skin layer of .4mm
Nah, mines 3k
Prusaslicer has one built in, i just need to import it
I cant figure out how to import a filament profile into prusaslicer
Depends, i didnt opt to download the compatibility 'module' when setting up my slicers since i dont use them but most have the option
Cooling or a hotend glob fell off perhaps
nicee
try smaller inside line width, gap fills generally worse wich is why arachne cura exists (uses smaller line widths or larger line widths where its needed to replace gap fills)
that gap fill is gonna be worse than walls iirc
smaller line width or test out arachne cura
yeah, so i can test it out now or we'll have to do this over a few days
uk, 1 30 ish for you right, theres a chance ill be but depends when you finish work
sorry to ask, but roughly how long til you get home, depending on time zones and all that kerfuffle i may be asleep, if thats the case i can try print it out with a ton of walls on my printer and see how it goes
No problem. Always happy to try help
But it could also be other issues, really depends on the setup. When you finish work send a photo of the printed part and I can see if I know the problem
try a outer shells first setting
overextrusion being forced outwards since theres no air gap maybe
*appart from a seldom few use cases
walls are always stronger thsn infill
definetly solid
ill upload a few screen caps
looks good to me, theres a few bits of gap fill but otherwise its fine
ill slice them/take a look, one of them is printing with one wall and the other needs gap fill right
Open beta
Or how long from now
Roughly what time are you getting on
use sequentil printing, it does one part then another
Also it depends how you are gonna load the part
Lines is densest and best for cosmetic items
Lines or rectilinear
esteps is very basic when you buy the printer kinda stuff, i figure that was already done
yeah, post procesing gcode goes last
but truer results, tune slicer first then firmware post procesing things last
different slicer then, i prefer cura
make sure PA is off when tuning
i dunno how but whenever i get a new machine its first few prints are perfect then a year down the line its just awul
but i got lucky with no tuning
mine is within +- 0.05
top doesnt stop the top lines from printing, ive set my top to 0.8 and walls to .6 and kept tuning flow til my walls were massively underextruded cause i thought they were .8
i keep mine in a tall vase, well best thing is do a hollow cube and chop off the last few layers and use vase mode and print at your normal speed, if cooling isnt good enough do a normal non vase mode print with multiple cubes and average those out and average those averages
chop the top few layers off one of those and take 16 measurments and do the mean average
like best quality ones
do you keep your favourite test prints
and if its overextruding check that your ptfe tube is flush if you have one and drop flow by a bit
and flow
or klipper eqv
e steps
oh yeah, that too
oh also, you can do a belt on one side and gear down a 0.9 motor to have identical steps per mm as a leadscrew
using vslot wheels on the edge of the bed connecting to the 2040 extrusions of a e5
or use 'wobble wings' like vez
add smooth rods/linear rails
you can either get a second z
well, z hop is gonna give you some stringing (usually) the best fix is to stabilise the bed, mine doesnt scrape since ive stiffened up the bed. i think a defualt is around half your layer height
check your pa isnt messed up
compleyte cylinder
and its only on cylinders
same as thew rest, this is also on the inside
thin walls
wdym?
nope
nah not enabled
Nope
Lemme check
I dont think so
Everywhere else is perfect
Whats with this underextrusion at the end of path
wich server
yep
Well goodnight
Dang
Actually?
What's the most nsfw thing you've done
Last ons
T or d
Yah lok
Yeah but for a first time kinda thing I would rather with a friend so I can be experienced for the proper thing
Yeah friends with benefits is where I wanna be with a guy/gal. No strings and all the fun.
So I've been as lucky as you
Unlucky. My guy crush was straight and my gal crush was hardcore lesbian
U?
Yeah
Not a bf (want one) had a pretty crap gf as a first relationship
T
Anywho one last round then I gotta also and I'll see you in the morning
Yeah. I bet one of your friends acts overly disgusted by gay stuff to hide that they are gay
Sae it a while back in a yt vid
Well statistically 1/3 people are gay so theres at least 1
At least Bicurious. Probably tho. You would be surprised
Discord counts as irl, right?
Yeah tbh at least 40% of your friends are lgbtq (probably)
Like twins
Like were matching
Twinsies?
Sexuality?
T or d
I gotta say. Either femboys or bodyswap/genderbender stuff
T
Xd
Yah
Ya know. I 'looked into it'
I've dabbled in that subredit a few times
Yep
Depends what kind
Bruh. This guy walked into my joke
What's the most niche/embarrasing porn you watch
Yeah course
We allowed nsfw or nah
T or d
Also nah not in one rn
Dw. No judgement
T
Yo itd your turn btw
Ah yeah. Those suck
About you or your life or habits
If you could change one thing what would it be
T or d
Yeh I replied to it. But now its gone
Ohh
Yeh
Wait
Its definitely just how I walk becuase I ovwr think it and fuck it up
T
Its up to you
Fair enough
Yeah. That's no fun, you wanna talk about that or rather not
Secret you have?
D
T or s
Yeah. It is but ya know they can come out whenever
Aight. I'm bi and I'm fairly certain most of my friend group is too and they all call me gay to cover it up becuase if 'I'm gay then they cant be too'
Like what kind. Like the 'i secretly love this soda' kind
T
Lmao. -4 floors
Photo of the dumbest thing you own
Uhm
T or d
Yeah. It wasn't too fun
My bag caught on a door and made me fall over, the door then swung back and hit the frame and bounced back into me as I got up and slammed me forward
T
Ok. I'm back
Ill brb
Good choice
If you had to be a anime titie, left or right?
Truth or dare
Anyways. I believe it was your go on truth or dare
Lol
Its from some old fart philosopher tho
Ngl I saw it on Michael reeves and took it
Well
it took my a few hours to reassemble so i could have done it in a day or two without the bad shipping and delays
welp im waiting on my print head and ive reassembled the printer with brackets in every corner
oh its just a quote from a philosopher i like
yeah i still need to buy new ball bearings to fix it but tbh the biggest problems with my printer is from me buying the wrong parts or breaking stuff
the other 2 are perfect without grease and better with
tbf only one was bad but its missing some balls and a hole is kinda misaligned
lol, i spent 10 bucks on the rails
i bought a used e5 (included in price) so not fully from scratch
yeah, im a slow builder and im keeping this build as budget as possible (currently ~160GBP)
since sptember 2020 but ive been buying parts as i finish parts of the build
alright, i think ive got a good idea on how to do my cfg
nice
yep, this is for a v1 with skrv1.4 and a bltouch- right?
of course, ill go through and check the cfg
thank you
yes please
i see, at least it runs kinda
i saw a mention of qcxr i assume thats quest craft xr, is it out or playable in any form yet
the video doesnt show up in the wand tutorial?
how do use wand tutorial
oh yeah sorry, so used to doing it to friends
Is it like an auto aim thing for thrown weapons that only hits the eyes?
oh cool
does lyneca have u11 already
is there a way to disable the arm preview of the camera mod
a multimeter
24v#]
rasising the motor current may have pushed the psu over the limit, we wont know til you measure voltage and watch for droop
measure voltage at the psu out and see if it drops
ah alright, if you try heat the bed on its own does it work
bed heater wattage?
you may be pulling too much power from your power supply
your bed heater might not be able to hit those temps
and most importantly what psu do you have
what cooling are you using
but pid tune runs correctly
but prints dont?
pid tune works?
if that fails do it manually til it can autotune
pid tune
perhaps endstop position -10 assuming theyre at 0
So (x axis length)/2
I believe probe points should be at the middle of you gantry
Yup, it's pretty easy, just look at the voron docs and the klipper docs and you should be able to figure out the rest
Or the equivalent
Do you mean with mainsail
ayy, congrats
oh possibly, my bad
would kiuah work or is that only after initial setup, cause thats easy as to use
yeah, it listens to the pi and executes commands the pi is where all the work is done and info processed
like occasional misfire or no fire
best i got with a day of tuning was 70mm/s but it was not healthy
20-25 is fairly good
Easiest way is to just @dalias
Alright cant find it but iuts somewhere in thi9s server and in the annex engineering server
Yup gimme one sec
It works better at high accel
BY dalias, might need a higher pa but ymmv
Yup
Cant connect anymore
Ohh i just change the port, cheers
And whats the url for dwc
Ah cool
Whats a port other than 80 i can use for dwc and for fluidd
I thought you could in the config
Print a thin plate that goes around the nozzle that has mounting holes for the adxl and unscrew and add this plate and boom, directly on the nozzle
So once I do it by hanf it makes more sense
I'm carp at 3d space and volume and visualisation
It makes sense if you move the belts by hand but in theory it makes no sense
Ouch. Mine was 50p
Reflash the boards klipper
You can do it, just gogle cnc klipper and take a peruse
Oh Yeah g01 doesnt work on klipper but its easy enough to make it map g01 to g1
Fairly certain you could, the spindle im not sure about but z and x and y would be normal klipper, temp sensor isnt needed and coolant pumps can be controlled as fans
It makes life so much easier to just type out english and have the printer work
Oh thank god i can just type home_z into the terminal and trigger a macro
Hes saying the documentation and community is garbage but if i could get my machine to run klipper im sure he could, and sometimes i get confused as to why theres backlash on leadscrews and take a good 20m debating it out in my head
Lol
Are you a CuLtIsT aNd AnGrY lItTlE pErSoN
Lol hes calling us supremists and angry little cultists
Altghough sensorless homing has the cool factor, not wearing out, less wiring and its silent without that annoying click
Nop
Alrighty, thanka for the help
Also your gonna have to dumb down that thread, my brain is hurting and it just cant make sense of it <@!630514181040242699>
Just rebooted the pi and now vnc won connect
Klipperscreen is installed but i get nothing after connecting via vnc
This should work
``` Service klipper stop

Sudo service klipper start```
Ah
Where's that go?
Am I doing something wrong?
Just ran the top line and it returned the bottom line
Sigh
fun times
hahahahahah
very dumbed down, but maybe, lemme go ask
so your phone will work iin one area but another
if i understand correctly then it changes your 'network' (kinda) depending on where you are
ah, 100% sure? before we go down the rabbit hole
well, is your computer on ethernet or wifi, obvious but ive fallen to this blunder all too often
make sure to change pins where needed and all that
no problem
<@!194525917920362497>
Way
And my printer isnt very standard any wag
Oh for sure. Hes gonna have to re do that part
Its generic 2209 I think on btt skr pro and a secondary board
Its not makerbase but I would be happy to send you my full cfg if you need it
2a is max and the klipper config doesntg use max value
how do you normally connect through the browser
ah my bad your on fluidd
or through
hm, so its just through the website, have you tried connecting through ip
stupid but try ethernet and make sure its not just a problem with wifi
make a macro called filament change thats retracts fiilament then pulls it in then primes
yes
Homing override and put in the gcode g28 y and then g28 x
Ideally yes but we dont live on a perfect world so its fine
Z offset is how far from the probed points to function and probe offset is how far off the nozzle tip in any direction your probe is
<@234475400313569280>. Z offset is very different from the probe offset
i know, mine was garbage but i had the same problem as him and could've fixed it but i didnt check the extruder
is it a TITAN EXTRUDER
Yeah any sensors have to be plugged in
So its tripping the runaway detection
Well this may be a shorted themistor
And min temp to negative 999999
And try turn it on
Set max temp to 999999
how are ypu doing that mesh tho
true
da fuck is that bed man
cool
so after the normal stuff i just run `make_flash`
oh good
<@!451709396280410132>
i can follow a guide to flash the board easily enough but i dont know how to get the firmware.bin on the board
i dont think i can do the thing with the sd card
alright, so its a 8 bit board
i have a 12v fan running at max 50% and its alright
but your never gonna print at 5mm/s
during a print its really bad to switch
they mean at e.g 60mm/s
<@!451709396280410132>  set stealchop threshold to 5 or so, at idle its activates stealchop and makes em silent and at any other spead it does spreadcycle
gcode:
    HOME

    # Abs pos
    G90

    {% if printer.gcode_move.position.z < 5 %}
        G0 Z5 F1000
    {% endif %}
    G0 X{ printer.toolhead.axis_maximum.x / 2 } Y{ printer.toolhead.axis_maximum.y / 2 } F{ printer.toolhead.max_velocity * 60 }
    G0 Z0 F300
My macro doesnt work anymore, not sure why but it wont move to the center, it moves a few 8mm but thats it
Oh I see.
ah, close
doomsdayn iirc
jarvis, scratch me behind the ears
do they taste nice? i never like grape flavour med
if it could go real time and work with any audio id spend all day in there
i just cant wait for a VR version of thpse
boys, is it good?
getting too high temp on my 5600x so i delidded
couldnt pry the damn thing off
had to really hammer my screwdriver in there
i took off the lid
delidded
thank you!!
anyone got the blue lobster vid and the organs playing in the audio
felt cute might delete later idk

Babe you barely touched your jellyfish cup, what's wrong?
rip, ive even deleted my save
was it any of these mods (ignore the red)
ever fix it?
its only in dungeons and i havent been able to fix it thus far
i wish, then id be able to remove it
funky
habie didnt know u could mod it tho üêí
blade and sockery is great
When the swim
One of my HDDs are from a dump
After going for a dip they are
Which one you want
Hehehehe I'm in the UK
I take that backm I'm stuck on mobile
True story. Wanna see a screenshot
Even gave me a 12v PSU for free
I'm just that cool. A guy I know is selling them by the box (~22 per box) for just shipping
And a 3tb one too
Nah
I'll record a POV of swimming with a 4tb drive
By putting them in the pool silly
I'm gonna go swim with them
Totaal
Not for u Habibi. I bought them all for $16
Yup got a raptor drive
I'll let you have the 4tb drive üëâ üëà
Ayo got a snack, anyone want
what
the good old days
perfection
tried my hand at compressingb the joker movie
hm
its just for display
Thanks for the tour today, your facilities are super cool and everyone was very friendly and welcoming
Cheers
Nah ill join when I get home. The email adres was for orders. Mines more technical
Talk to btt tony then
Where cam I get in touch with btt support, my skr v1.4 died today. Its just the 3.3v possibly 5v cant tell. Its powering on but the mcu doesn't post since theres no power to it
Cheers
INTERESTING
If it was a script would someone mind @me
My friends love overwatch so this game should be a great fit
Cheers
No no, inv to the discord server, im on it but i dunno where i found the invite to it
Can someone send me the inv to the server
gimme 4m
sure
should be sorted ü´°
gotcha
whos the new owner of VZ.356
yeah sure, it got sold?
yep yep
Looks to be 2 colour max but I assume it'll be used for max flow rates so probably just one colour at a time
i just ordereed one aswell - my old one broke - in the meantime i ordered a m3 3950 from amazon and they sent me the cartridge type üò≠
inline filament drying?
mid 20s eh
~~@maze ~~
i handle the USA stuff
That's great photo tho
Aha gosh my hair has changed a tonne since then
ah i cant remeber what version we gave him, theres 3 different ones. lemme get a pic of the one i got
which graphics on nero's?
lol
they just spammed annex too
same, it mightve taken a second longer maybe or passed through the filter
had to take a sec to check if they were a new user or not then banned
just happened to open discord right as it was sent üòÖ

I get the same when I pry ABS off the bed while hot
Would it not be stress discoloration 
the gentlemen is so damn good
Probably beacon
Just enough to comfortably get it on and trim
Cool so 4m will leave me spare
Buying new belts for the VzBot, I want gates gt2 6mm, 4m length right?
so no belt?
otherwise when pushing the y axis by hand the head doesnt move
the wiring is rubbing on the lid?
its bad right?
hows my input shaper look
ah well
did you catch the username
yeah theres been a tonne
phishy didnt catch it
daMN
yup
klipper has a max extrude length as a safety thingy. just unload and increase that limit
yeah its telling your extruder to make a really long move
whats the problem? ive run something similar on a corexy before
like via the steppers or a speaker?
yup
Had some filament that leaked, so sock came off for cleaning
I have a placeholder
Drill , metal file and M4 screw
trying to convey how unwieldy a object thats a few thousand mm log isnt as helpful as a few metres
i was working with a friend on a larger project so set it to cm so they could understand better
yeah
mellow on aliexpress sells partial kits for both sizes
3mm or 2.6mm diameter?
But big under extrusion which I'm 99 percent sure is because the missing pin
Printer world great
Hm
Heated up and tightened more, looks to be okay now
Between nozzle and block
Still leaking after tightening
It extrudes at least, more pressing is the Goliath issues
It could've which would suck
Those don't grow on trees üòÇ
Spares? ü§®ü§®
Cool, the two vzbextrudort pins, is there any substitute I might have lying around
Found out I'm missing a pin in the extruder so can't print anyways
Yeah lemme grab a pic
My Goliath is leaking, what kinda gap should there be between the nozzle and block
She was happy to finally meet everyone I talk about
And now jay does too üòÖ
VzBot on the move, built by <@561307644841689092>
is <#1021734019139903508> for 3d printers only?
ive been told by my school to run a engineering club, whats a good project for 10-15 people whove never created anything before to start with, we have a budget of around ¬£100, preferably itd be something that each person could take home but it could be 1 large thing or like 3 people per thing made. originally we tried doing robot wars but no one is experienced enough to know how to start so it kinda fell apart. im open to any suggestions
i *think * jay might be
hey long time no see üëã
whats gonna be worst for noise/ quality
whats gonne be worse, drv8825 on e or z1. im one 2209 short for a ender with dual z
slow ass shipping tho
yeah i just got it from their store
and heat up when i pick it up again and it heats up super fast
i set it to cool down when i put it down becuase i forget to turn it off
so cool
its actual fire
got a pinecil the other day
So it'll be flying soon
We just got a 0.8mm cht
Haha live tuned üòé

I remember paying 90 for sure, can't remember anything else
Np
There's a break down in <#898594881495244822>
One sec, I think I payed around 150 by the end
35 is such a good deal tho, I'll pick one up next paycheck
Idk if it's artificial but it may be because mellow was doing a factory change so they're just producing as much as possible and putting it on sale asap instead of doing one big drop later
That'll hammer out

hence the <:dab:931268940217339905>  emote

We're gonna be so busy
Can't wait to see what he says
to stop the table shaking?
tried adding weights?
you got artifacts?
i dont think so
its not perfectly adhereded to the bed
the print isnt 100% rigid so that might be a source of artifact
so ig they just want to get th word out without compeltely showing the product
annex never likes revealing incomplete products
let out the magic smoke?
got a link to that shaft
its like somethng 94?
the esun one?
hey <@822479329215774720>  how do you get so much flow out of that volcomosq, i just saw your new speedybenchy
cant wait for my cross country bed to come in. im getting tired of this slop skiing
üò¨
my cr10 bed has a crazy high variance, something like 2mm. i cant wait to get my vzbot built
maybe i wont drop the 80 to buy a beacon and just go clicky instead
thank you üôè
i really thought it was the end all be all
weird, you got a before and after photo of the mesh?
damn thats a lot of buttons
my small ass door may be an issue]
also, whats the boxes dimensions
it says may 10th
is the estimated shipping really that fast
im so pumped
GOT THE KIT
I ORDERED üòé
ive done it accidently before
no no, through aliexpress. theres a way

ugh all my friends are competitive players
already taken care of
Yeah a little bit
Cool cool, a smooth matte surface would be satin/smooth PEI or glass or g10
<@296819926013050881> are you after a nice finish or is it a sensory thing
Yeah it's matte smooth PEI
Why not satin pei?
what country?
When it gets there we'll register it üòé
cost is no problem
just some li-ion batteries and a torch possibly
not commercial
yo, anyone got experience shipping stuff from the EU to the UK
iirc Rac's got a proper water-cooling block he made for his stepper
yeah i gotchu- which one?
i tried smaller lines
ahh
thats amazing wuality
wonders at clogging my printer üò≠ 
looks great for you though
i almost expected resin
wow
what printer?
damn thats a beaut
hundreds of kits sold (i thibk)
a lot are facebook-ers currently or just unregistered
or is it april genuis?
are very serious
we
no no
ive been trying to convince the parents a 3d printer has moer value than repairing our roof, they dont seem convinced
üéâ
havent played for a bit ( and most of my recent plays werent uploaded) but ive broken into the top 1k in the UK
Or maybe 40 and spend the rest on a nice flashlight
But I suppose I could get 50
I only really need the one
70k is roughly what 50 or so vzbots
Smart guy
Ah ü´°
Who?
no chance
whats the room temp
erm
i guess that the open edges would need to be sealed to be safe again
vzbot
well
eugh
when you said large was thinking like fingernail size max
aw hell nah
didnt know it was bad for electronics,  seems obvious since carbons conductive sometimes. im surprised theres less fuss about cf dust but theres so much about ABS fumes
cf dust is AWFUL on the lungs. which is why we dont recommend people diy it
Did you...fill it with expanding foam
hahahaha everythings just another rabbit hole üòÖ
welcome back
its been almost a year
OH SHIT DUDE YOU'RE BACK, I THOUGHT YOU GONE FOR GOOD
VR üòé
bro play some better games then
<@402169283167256589>  has been offline since mid 2021
nah this guy was the first in here to mess around with ceramic bearings way back when
one of the very early vzbot team members has been offline for a while, i dont know if they lost the acc or just stopped 3d printing
Which is why I'm thinking it's something on the pi, you can watch its hardware utilisation during a print, you should see there if it's getting very high that would be a pretty clear sign <@328289991711129611>
I'd think that but the octo pro should be plenty
Unlikely rhoufh5
The cable between pi and mobo
Unlikely but it might be your cable, might be you've set gcode resolution very high. Could be a couple things
Pi does all the computation and the motherboard just enacts the commands
Unplug it and run a test
Welp context changes that for sure, the camera might maybe be it
You could try interpolation if you need the high microstepping although it's not recommended
Just jumping in without full context but it sounds like either your pi or motherboard can't handle the step frequency
personally id get rscs and a cpap tho thats very overkill
i only see a 5015 fan there
how do you word it? ive thought about it occasionally but always feel weird asking for stuff
wdym exactly? like every click gets you points or its a referral link and you get money?
yeah the 330 should do exactly what you want, you can customise exactly which parts go in so some of the quality aspect hangs on what parts you use
Yeah you can rejoin after a kick just not after a ban
I'll unban him tomorrow and if he rejoins it'll be permanent
All sorted
if you need the group translated then theres plugins for BetterDiscord that will do that
what do you mean?
what from?
uh oh
not me running for a v12 on each axis
but yeah
most steppers are 48v capable
rgb belts ü§î
so yeah it should let you go faster
theyre certainly lighter and more ridgid
eh not a troll, whats up with the messages tho
oh well
droid just deleting all their msgüíÄ
my bad
of course
ahhh
1982?
nah we like him, a lot of his work applies to standard printing just not always to vzbot speeds
same with cartesian becoming to mean bedslinger
yeah since levelling has become such a unanimous phrase its not important
flashbacks to the levelling V tramming debate
<:bigstupid:1004817384164577351> 3d printer community attempts to agree on names for different motion systems <:bigstupid:1004817384164577351>
especially since the name of cartesian is a bit of a misnomer
i think we've got different ideas of what clissifies as cartesian
no it is corexy <@147671898350813184>
one sec
wait wait i couldve sworn its corexy
current printers a cartesian?
ohh
wdym cartesian?
shouldnt make too much difference. just to check youve printed a 2/3 wall cube and measured the side width to check flow?
flowrate well calibrated?
i had a horrid leak from my heatbreak that dropped burnt blobs all over my printer
check flowrate and check all around your hotend for a leak
is your nozzle picking up bits of filament and burning it while printing
vez and mellow work their ass off
the guy is crazy, i could never keep up with all that
ming has to keep up an entire store + increase manufacturing capacity for most items + increase his workforce + set up a cost efficient method for producing the new kit
the kit might increase in price, but the cost will be less than self sourcing the identical parts
awesome
really?! time i upgrade the rest of my printers then

<:sadge:1004524978240229386>
cut a solid hole in the top? i usually print abs+ with no enclosure and avoid drafts
you should see if the layer isnt fully cooled if you watch it print
though the real fix is better cooling
dropping tghe bed temp might help with the base being conical and melting
ABS+ needs quite a bit of cooling ime. have you tried a slightly lower bed temp
whats your bed temp?
you can always try more parts per plate
Yeah the moon's is quite good for the extruder
normal really
no zhop
ohh
if u z-hop maybe binding
on top surfaces might be slight overextruding
depends where
yeah or overextruding
u got me doubting thp#
i thought so
lives in canda iirc
he is?
which part was pricy for you?
really? its a roll or so at most no?
external print services are priiicy
oh truee, unless youre able to print it on a printer you already own
metals defibitely worth it, but if you cant afford or dont want to spend a ABS vzbot is plenty respectable
he gets all the newest goodies
vez's is probably peak vzbot performance
nah i just completely imagined that
youtube.com/watch?v=Gld6p1nuNGY&t=217s
thats the one i thought was cura (it isnt)
oh?
ah then iirc vez's monitor stand print was using the defualt cura profile and that thing is danm perfect
i think theres a difference between strength and quality, are these like biking helmets or cosmetic helmets
oh i was just in that area
and you could get a full WC goliath for that
than 2 printers
so the hotend is worth more
350 CAD is 215 GBP
more
asssuming its 350 CAD
the hotend itself is worth almost as much
god damn
brooo you could sell them and make back most of what you spent
damn
thats a realllly good deal
send him to me, ill clean it üòé  trust me bro           /s
my friend, my best buddy. remember your old pal. ill make you a profit off those, 355?        /s
oh well
hmm
does the :smoothbrain: emoji work for you?
could someone with nitro drop a :smoothbrain: real quick
just head over to <#834043767111417916>
yours would certainly pass
<@330479964942106634>
am i tripping or are the layers steaming??
but the bridges i printed were so short the fan didnt hav time to spin up
i reckon its the bridging setting
yeah thats right
anything look wrong?
is that firmware or slicer problem
hmm my cooling fan bounces from 100 to 0%
for extruders, the sherpa mini is <:chefkiss:890007032965521448>
new stepper drivers is the big one, external tmc5160 are all the rage for serious high speed printing (so uis 48v for steppers but i wouldnt reccomend it if you arent super comfortable with electronics yet)
list in order of importance (at least in my opinion, but it depends)
extruder/hotend + new mobo + raspi + stepper upgrade + linear rails    would be everything else you need for a proper speed machine
the rapido and nf crazy likely will have mounts available for your printers
goliath is a vzbot original, though it probably doesnt have an existing mount for your printer
yep
GOLIATH, or the rapido, or the volco mosq (nf crazy is the mellow name iirc)
well, theres a lot of choices, but what are you aiming for (pure speed, pellet extruder, all rounder)
should be fine for that then
im very biased, but i love the community here
theres <#1065704050282201199>  which i dont pay too much attention too, so id ask over there if you intend to do engineering filaments. but normal AB enclosure are fairly standard
should be cheaper i think, but definitely more sturdy and faster
tbh its hard to say everything about a printer, try asking more about specific parts
its very *smol*
yeah id get mechanical stuff figured before tuning
oh if its hevort then yeah, prototype, vez and mirageC are friends <@594024628960231446>
id like to replicate this, tho im no quite there
my first audio-->image AI gen
depends where you are shipping is expensive. i think its around 1.1k-1.3k gbp
they are the official partner for kits
mellow might restock after the new year
ignore it, if someone has been scammed they should reach out to an admin. as far as im aware we've never had that issue
Of prints?
A green glowing ..... Would be scary to see in a bush late at night
I'm gonna print some gitd bones, mini figures and bits to hide around my area
Cheers, those are good
boys i got a UV torch, my purple and orange and red filament glow. whats some good things to print in those colours?
just my two cents, but a lot of voron feels like side-grades and occasionally they accidently fall upwards
i coudnt tell if it was the cheap a4988s buzzing or the printer screaming for death but either way it was a terrible machine
god no kidding, my cheap ass duct-tape 3d printer taught me so damn much
mhm yes <@753687059331416106> he has a point üòÜ
i much prefer a unscripted video from a knowledgeable person
nah i prefer it, you get a conversational feel. some youtubers deliver short snippy information filled videos and ill end up zoning out and having to rewatch
and your one of the channels i watch instead of just listening to
its always a joy to watch
<@509772297289072653> just started the new vid, just wanted to say, your videos are always so well framed (or composed idk the name)
the boat?
mellow on aliexpress but they might maybe be sold out
tie it to the roof <:wesmart:890660011531989072>
you have a roof, yes?
maybe give it a review
bit of a speed demon eh
i hear the new ender can hit 100mm/s stock
<:chefkiss:890007032965521448> <:dab:931268940217339905>
whichever one of us slips through the cracks and gets it is gonna have a lovely chrimus
hope so
its just gonna keep cascading and filling up
yeah i dont see it being fixed before christmas
its terrible, gotta find out what its like at the local depot from my postie
im just hoping my other parcels arrive üò¢  estimated for the 6th but the strikes delayed it
yeah no way these make it
10
<:sheesh:927939329060388894>
total cost?
whatd you get?
yeah the orbiter was amost instantly gone
and some Ultem
yeah i bought some nozzles and the std. may as well test it and compare to LSD
well this is sick
icl, im not sure. its from alien3d (or ufo3d?)
owh shit i just won something
3dpn giveaway links
ends in 4min
i wont spam it here. but look in <#832082556127019051>
quite well
2nd ones got a bluetooth heatbreak
hmmm
london, its cause people take a 2 hour bus to school and the busses dont do good on ice
we got snow
school cancelled
nah, not quite what im after
lemme look
i dont think hsi go all the way round
try cover as many angles from the front as you can
with some reeeall nice lighting
of their vzbot
could someone take a 1-2 minute video
ive got an idea
i dont see why not, as long as you're sure the button will be hit
thats awesome
so its a 4wd-->2wd conversion that can easily be swapped back to 4wd? <@299951484294922241>
Nothing guaranteed by us
Peer 2 peer
Hard to guarantee quality, I think we settled on doing it privately fir the most part
might do
phaetus customer support
yup. biqu hemera edition
oh yeh him
marcoreps??
wait marco who?
reddit loooves drama
rest of video is great too, i could listen to you talk all day
intro is fire
at this point, arent we all desparate for LSD
icl i dont know much about mellows stock, just give him a @ over in <#864089371188002836>  he replies daily
for most yeah, but not over in china
might be stoc still, id @mellow to get the most up to date info
covid, the area mellow is in is still in lockdown iirc
that wouldnt be possible and im sure mellow would say the same if he talked to him  /s

mellows got them al RN and i think hes still stuck in lockdown unfortnutely, so i couldnt get one even if i wanted
the one time im offline <:kekw:906674564879233024>
gonna have to ban you
i have some sad news
<@448202437808095232>
Cheers. It might end up slightly cheaper
im told they work, just nozzle offcenter etc
ill ship you the 2nd nozzle when it arrives in uk, or if US when i arrive in the US
did you clean it well first
ooooh, gim
damn thats clean
ah im just poking fun
oof 150 to 20. thats quite the range
Wish I knew, you can always try asking in annex engineering
yeah once they announce it, we'll see. But right now there's 0 details available
The probe they use is apparently entirely custome and entirely unannounced
Not 100 percent sure tho
I think it's 100x100
because no probing
100x100 super speed mesh
Oh, 68 in stock. I must've juuust got it
oh it was *just * at 68
go go go go go
Link?
ohh, thats what he meant by whisper
pardon?
but also some propped up cardboard or insulation foam panels will work well enough
partly cause im lazy
i wouldnt bother making a proper enclosure
yes, you just need a way to enclose it
not sure how that partnerships going tho
its a affiliate, so he gets money from each purchase
i use retractable lanyard holder o suspend the cables
a channel for sourcing help, or a docs page with help
when the temp is too high, the fuse breaks and prevents the bed from overheating
üíÄ
yeah, if youre looking for a full kit, mellow releases theres in ~1 week
mellow has been sent to lockdown, so the page is up for viewing but they set availability to 0, nothings been sold yet
fair enough, i think ill be buying a 235 but i gotta see what the config options are
from what ive heard its 1k+ but comes out cheaper than self sourcing
pretty much yeah, check out the first vid of the vzbot on vezs channel
welding?!
in a bowden it wouldnt work
ah, i was really only thinking of my printer, where no bowden so it doesnt matter if theres a smidge of over pushing
do you have a bowden tube going to the hotend?
and for the retraction, stick a ratxhet on the input for the extruder, then it can only feed forward
deretraction wouldnt be much of an issue no, just the retraction
idk if its feasible but, ratchet on the 2nd extruder connected in parallel to the main extruder
yeah i get that, but im having a hard time imagining why closed loop would be better/ any different
ah, so a smart way, idk much about software but iirc btt has a filament monitor with a roller that measures how fast its going, could have a extruder push n+1mm. although i dont think you really need closed loop for this
otherwise you could just use your z port for the extruder and have it use the two ports--->one driver
i only say the steps per mm because id worry the main extruder out running it marginally
id imagine you could take any old extruder, mount it near the spool and then set its steps per mm a tiny bit higher than the actual value to ''over extrude'' and then link it to the main extruder
but
havent seen any desighn
yup,
But 2.5mm variance is about what I've got on a craptastic cr10 bed
Turn on scale gradient
dayum
printing or mid air
check <#859133490041454592> for info, theres no finalised date but i think its around november
seems like its be much easier on a bed slinger
hahahaha
ive got some new stuff i dont need, not drilled or cut tho
also do you need a sheet
leds around the side+ engraving on the panel
is there a way to save a z babystepping value to apply to all prints
erm
sorry where do i see that. its been a while since ive klipper-ed
sorry to ask, but i forgot what to do to fix this
lemme find the article
i assume they had draft shields set up, but being able to only heat the object vs an entire volume is more efficient
for open air pekk (i think)
NASA attempted directional heaters for the printed object
iirc
for prelayer heating or to heat the item you print
no, actively heated chamber would be neat
can be water cooled
and the hotend deisnged for it
id say considering most of the printer is metal
Ime I left it at 16. But you can try them all and see what works for you
Klipper reccomends not using stealthchop or interpolation as it introduces some lag to the system. But if you have to just use any microsteppung value you like and stealthchop
Yup. Any stepping will work
The tuning sheet is in the pins in <#832082556127019051>  iirc
Or use stealthchop
You can try the trinamic tuning sheet but that sounds normal for tmc in spreadcycle
ayyy happy birthday! ü•≥
Not sure I get it, mind annotating it
If there's any skips (for house renovations) nearby I'd recommend looking for a old panel of insulation, I built a okay temporary enclosure with 4 sides of foam and the rest cardboard. Managed to hit 40c after a while without much air circulation. I found a lid to be most important
Yeah mine went okay without, won't hurt to have tho
vzbot v2 when?
that doesnt sound right
the stock kit?
its all a balancing game
true
all of this can be fixed for fairly cheap. take a look in <#946930214452199524> most still use 24v
so one lump sum, or smaller initial investment
cool, so either you go full DIY and have someone else do your printing. or you upgrade from x5sa and do it bit by bit
is this your first printer?
i have one, its okay but the moving bed is quite limiting and theres not much of a upgrade path imo
personally id ask asap and see how fast theyll send. if theres nothing available then it is what it is
or people who returned out of frustration or didnt like like 3d printing, you can search !amazon returns" in the discord to see how other people like them
abby1@tronxy.com email them and ask if theres any returned ones in stock
if time isnt a worry. you can get them ~40% off from the amazon returns lot
it'll print for sure. it might not be super fast, or fun to use. but it does function
v6 knockoffs are fairly cheap from aliexpress and iirc the EVA supports those
some people purely upgrade the gantry and add klipper, that might be in your price range if you only use printed parts
Hiya. So feature wise they're all very similar, the biggest difference is the size and iirc the 235 has 4wd whereas the others dont
Eh didn't like the name anymore, can't really show my family "that's me and here's what we do" especially when they're religious
I've been craving a smooth bottom
HM alright, ill give mine a try tomorrow I guess
hm, i found mine was pretty bad, did you buy from anywhere special or use any prep other than soapy water?
And theres always the vz 235x235 if 330 is a bit big for you
id say anything with the xy motor mounts, idlers, gantry block then itd count
some scummy knockoff
its not an official seller
wow gotta buy this asap
but its slow as üí©
ive already got a 330x300 bed
mostly lightweight gantry, maybe super speed
i think ill end up with whatevers full metal tho
yah either the 250x250 or 150x150 model
yeah im thinking 250 maybe 150 awd with triple z. depends what kinda performance the smaller sizes get
i see one thing online saying iut with straight lines instead of circular holes
oris that something else im thinking of
thats where you machine the printed part?
gonna be splurging and getting a full bells and whistles vzbot
ty ty
assuming all goes well
but, im halfway to getting certified as a lifeguard, so in ~1 month ill be able to start applying to lifeguard on the weekend
gotta be 16 to work
legally, not for a few months
im trying! cant get a job yet so no moneys
ü§®
yeah that was maybe a month after the very first vzbot video iirc
that was way back when tho
i mean
obviously
its my ‚ú® charming looks ‚ú®
mhm
im white but okay?
although deven also handles a lot of that
oh yeah, i joined server pretty early on, i mostly manage the discord side of stuff
huh?
hi, welcome to the server
I gotta see where the hotend cooling fan plugs in on the expansion board
Anyone got a cr10s pro
Looking at my wiring. Do tmc2208s really need cooling? They run normie speeds (sub 70mm/s) so I'm leaning towards no cooling fan and just leaving the heatsink
awesome
so if the fan ground and the psu ground arent connected its nfet
ah so i gotta check if it switches + or -
so both fans negative go to the printers mobo and the other positive wires to the psu
if i want to take 2 fans and control them off the same input
can i connect the two grounds and connect the positive to the psu?
or will i need to power them separately
no quad diesel engine??????? git gud lad
just sticking a thermal epoxy in there might be worth it
idk how flat both sides are
i wonder if itd be worth it
to screw onto the motor
niceee. id buy if they had lil screw holes
sure thing, cant guarantee ill have the answers
sure, any in particular
Yeah I know, I really should get one. Originally I was gonna get one of the first ten but with how fast the project moves I always thought it's be better to wait since there were always improvements around the corner. But I've finally decided I HAVE to build one
ironically, havent built yet. im planning on building at the end of this year getting all the bells and whitsles once i get a ton of time off school
loved it on my slow ass cr 10
i used to have one
get nice round numebrs for wall sizes
1mm walls ez
but
isnt that what rebreather does. i cant remeber
what happwnwd?
nah you mightve seen us announce it was starting soon
in <#859133490041454592>
yeah sorry, someone sniped it
so once its back we can register you
keep it open, the bots having some difficulties since we hit 100
screw holes dont aline?
seems a little <#832082556127019051>
<:hmmm:1004524884149424148> hmmmm
sounds like a penis
Cool, if I can finish up my work in time I'll swing by for a bit
I think this is like the 5th time I've seen it active in there
Hey <@210780931303276544> what's going on in general
done
and boom
okey, so RAMEN, glue and a chisel. youre gonna chisel out the shape of a 2208 stepper driver. then add some gold paint to the legs/pins for better conductivity
ohh you wanna diy the stepper driver?
well with some fine macaroni and glue you can model anything
flush cuttersd
nah you can see another pin next to it
then desolder
cut off the black heatshrimk at the switch
got a pic
is it soldered?
boom
step one: download stepper.png
step two: scale accordingly on word
stp 3; go to print tab
4. go to your printer
step 5- click print
yeup
cant say im a professional at these graphs tho
so if im clear on what it means its before:100000 and now:10000
the first was 1e5, the new is 1e4
just
the multiple peaks can be seen before and after
sure, ill try keep an eye on the requests
bot got fixed and 90 is now available, start your request and i can get you registered
My bad, meant 88. The announcement channel has the most up to date figures since it's automated by the serial bot
we have two in the queue so once we finish those we'll be at 78
we just need a presentable and printing machine
mediocre is a-okay
aliexpress bulk order likely
thats a bad idea, carbon fibre dust is a huggeee no no, so when the rods start to wear down our gonna have problems
what'd he do?
respect it
everyone has an opinion
So while it's not a satisfactory answer
 Sit tight, all's well on your side
You're eligible, and once the bot finishes it's temper tantrum we'll register you
Alright
I see, lemme check something real quick
The click to get ticket or the approval
offtopic squabbles
My school only starts in early September
Ah same, visiting family rn
What country?
A lot of the mod team is out rn
Wether it's friendly or not. Put it on a separate thread and keep the server tidy
Sure sure
Just keep it civil unless you make a thread and clearly label it as nonsense, don't clog the text chats for silly squabbles
Oh, Welp another admin will get it at some point
You'll have to get this one, I'm stuck on mobile
Right after asking you to be civil
Really
Dude
Insults about "your mom" is childish and what I expect from my 10yr old cousin
Civil rational discussion over printer design is ok üëåüëå
That's plenty
Alright
I've got one where it's a little faster
Ah cool
What's it for?
Np
Any old printer just homing
Sure
<:sadge:1004524978240229386>
Lemme retry
These guys seem to be working on it
And of you want the lidar feature
Those have a m6 thread iirc but I'm not around my computer to verify
I don't do cad sorry. Is that for the pneumatic fitting though?
Harsh man, that cut deep
<:hmmm:1004524884149424148>
Some foil and a metal heat guard will fix that
Boss doesn't even pay me tho
It's always just 'whatre you doing, spit that gum out or you'll be in detention'
Same
Hahahahahahahaa
Everyone knows it's velociraptor shaped
Man get a load of this guy
I used a piece of float glass for initial building and a friend's counter to do the final tightening
People who usse their lawn to build on as it feels flat enough to walk on: <:bigstupid:1004817384164577351>
just get a putty knife and scrape those little bits off, they just add heat to the gpu

within 90 days you usually get your money back or you and the seller can come to a agreement
if you need the money, you can open a dispute
tsa didnt mind 21 hdds and a psu so im sure theyll be okay
instead of shipping, ill be in the us in a couple weeks, i can carry it for free (then you ship it from the UK to earope)
78 here
Check out your regional channel e.g  <#898595123150090340>  if you're french
You can so that or get someone in your area to print
i think its a random beta
hello üëã
which i know isnt the answer you want but. theres no point splurging when your printert might only handle speeds a volcano can deliver
id first find your speed limits then find a hotend
its what i daily drive. i have a .8mm for special occassions. wanna see some sample prints?
for 1.75mm filament
1.8mm cht from bondtech or mellow
this many
Check out dalias's mod. Iirc it 'removes' retraction and integrates it into PA
Whereve you been before
Nicr
Giveaway or review?
i saw a tiktok where someone polished a phone with salt. so ive started putting salt on all my linear rails and ballscrews in the hope theyll polish themselves through normal use
What do you use
 I've started getting chlorine water cause it makes nice fumes while printing
if  its vzbot xy then sure
i had a board catch flame , the entire 5v and 3.3v lines were charred. otherwise never killed anything
Oh wow
I bought some a while ago, still waiting for it to arrive
the new LSD flow test drops and a day later we hit 4.20k members
<@287357528780570625> ^
g.level
but if its warping. maybe try saltwater on a hot bed
i know everyone says it. but wash the bed really well with soap until it feels *squeaky *clean
having adhesion issues?
Or message a admin with the request
But if your aiming for a number. Check <#891655831282647071> to see the latest number
I'll reset the ticket number when home. Make it a little more intuitive
I occasionally set it properly but it always gets messy
The ticket numbers get funky when people don't pass the request
itll ''inject'' HV into the driver without any danger to the board
you can get things like the powerbrrr from maze though which can be gotten from a pcb manufacturer or maze directly for pretty cheap
`I have use 35v caps `
0.8x35=28
but yes, more voltage is more good. just be aware of what your capacitors are rated for
you should always stay under or at 80% of the caps rated voltage
joels brain would melt if he saw the vzbot
that whole video had me laughing when they mentioned speed
gn
i actually say a few of the older years in dresses cause they arent allowed shorts
hit 32 inside one day
my school hasnt turned on the AC all week. still gotta have full uniform though
Sorry it's so late. But it depends on who's verifying the serial. Generally though, a working printer that isn't a fire hazard is the bare minimum. You can always apply and have us say 'clean it up and come back later'. There's no penalty for having a messy printer
Cool, i can register it once I'm home
Plus some other info
If plastic comes out the hotend, the XYZ moves and you have a video of it that fulfills the requirements
Hexagons might look better. And you can get your slicer to do the heavy lifting for that
Why'd you choose a flying gantry over moving bed? I would think raising a bed is cheaper?
That works too
True, all depends on what you have on hand. I've got a lot of cpu coolers and copper slugs
Ive seen heatpipes for cheap, I wonder if you could connect them to a old cpu cooler via heatpipes
Welp. I'm half way there in old parts. Maybe it's time I dig out my old printer. What printed parts are there
Plot twist it's just a large poster with a photo printer on
üò≥
Ah. Bought used. Which parts were used
Using spare parts or all new?
Doesn't look bad at all. How much did you spend?
Welcome to the club
Heheheheh
I think we're in the top 5 for most users for diy 3d printers (don't quote me on that though)
We should do something for 5k. Not sure what though
Woohoo üéâ
personally, montage+ a detailed coverage of issues you encpunter
probably just resting there until a bracket can be printed (just my guess)
thats u ^
Even my stock cr10 extruder did better. Although it slipped instead of doing that when the nozzle was too close
oh duh, sorry, its late
and for the spacers, aliexpress is full of them
i think any size above 45 would be fine
gotta be the motor then, right?
hm
and no other motor does it
48v?
trying to explain it
one sec
can you check if the phases are connected correctly
are they plugged into the same driver?
well dont plug it back in
which part?
can you try it in another slot?
cool
alright, so it gets warm and sends error messages when moving
so the driver heats up and send a error message with the psu **on**
yeah i can take a peak
are you getting that global scaler error without the psus on ?
the driver or the motor?
jumpers set correctly?
hm
data only cable
thats the only connected thing with power, so only reason steppers would get warm without a psu on
yeah
do you know if the cable is a power+data cable?
hm, the steppers shouldnt be on at all if the psu is off
any other spi peripheries
do you have a display?
for dual z on one driver
2 connectors are tied to one driver
im back on pc so i can look at the cfg
oh i see
sorry which one is yours and whioch is an example cfg?
Yeah that too. Unless you want sensor less homing
I think so, before trying to home, manually verify the endstops and for the first homing turn down the speeds, 20 is what I used at first until I had everything sorted
Alright it all looks fine, assuming your using the same hardware as listed, you just have to turn it on and verify everything is turning the right way and that endstops work
I can take a look, I'm on mobile though so you'll have to copy paste it or upload to pastebin or alike
So far I've seen: skirts, backpacks, separate enclosures with a an umbilical to the printer (like the cr10) or separate enclosure with quick disconnect plugs
And minor difference in mounting would add some variance (although probably not noticeable)
Suppose so, as long as everyone is using the exact same belts
You'd have to find the right torque which would take a while
I'll give you 17 and a box of off season blueberry's
Tbh I prefer apple pie but you can drown your sorrows in any pie I suppose.        /S
Send address, we'll come help (I'm definitely keeping it if I find it)
Uh oh
It's a unhelpful answer, but boards are all up to the builder. Take a look in <#946930214452199524> to see what people are using. You can get: tow boards one for 48v and one for 24v; one board all 24v: one board combining 24 and 48; one 24v board and a 48v injector.         There's a lot of options
Nema17 Is a standard size that so far works best for vzbot. There's different lengths and spec nema17 tho. Take a look at vezs video comparing motors. you don't have have the best steppers and any motor will work (just not as fast)
Nothing but good times with their tpu
Wow that's awsome
Gotta get beamshots with the flooder too
This is what torches were made for
Ah cool, good luck
Does it have a lip to hold it to the extrusion
Oh good üòä
Sorry that came off wrong
 I'm not going to back at my computer for a week or so
Should be easy enough to design in tinkercad, I'd make a mockup if I could but I'm not at home rn
It's not as good, but you can replace them later
Also called hammer nuts I think. But yeas you can print them and insert a heatset or normal nut
If you attach a off center item the lathe rocks you to sleep <:wesmart:890660011531989072>

that just means they built a machine, they can still be idiots. thats how we got <@163132418776236032>
looks good
slow speed open air it warps, high speed it weirdly doesnt. which like a lot of speed printing seems counterintuitive3
kek
pun intended?
stringing is pretty much inconsequential for a 1mm nozzle
quality isnt too bad
filament be like

like the LSD
nah still poorly disguised weiner jokes
"just  ignore the k3, its probably just the lighting"
"and if you polled r/3dprinting im sure your speeds are actually above average"
" any more speed would just be annoying you know, and you have wonderful character"
''dont listen to him cr 10, the 35 mm/s you can handle are plenty for me''
Mainsail is just a interface, it shouldn't stop you from using any features
Can always host it yourself
Yep. Don't think anyone's sold one yet. We'll have to discuss our policy on it
Seems ticket bot is having issues. I can't use it either
Sure is. I think Christmas wanted to keep the number 15 and have you re-register. I can add you both to a ticket and figure this out. But it'll have to wait until I'm back from school in ~10hrs (sorry)
thermal runaway go brrrrrrrrrr
Looks like two peices with a bolt through it. So left right swivel. Maybe up down at the mounting holes of the monitor
huh, ill try uninstall and re install maybe
dop you have to do anbything other than install it, i cant get the settings page open
rather the screw wobbles than the bed
im no profesional, but isnt the point of leadscrews is that they **do **have a twist
ah cool, good luck
cool, i cant remeber who but i think someone else also scaled up the 235. ill be happy to get you a serial when its built
is it built yet or still in design phase?
1.2mm cht and a LSD, couple hours maybe?
depends on a lot though
probably 4-6 hrs id guess

Check the tracking number. AliExpress oversimplified the shipping. Turns out mines at Heathrow airport rn
ill see if i can find it
there was actually a custom UVB light beuilt just like that recently
imagine a field of 15 or so tents. one glows bright with the power of nuclear reactor while the others just shout at me to turn the fucking lights off
its gonna be a field of 20 people piddling around with dinky lights. then i whip out my mega lights and 3kg bag of spare batteries and release the power of the sun
but yes
i have been meaning to get a flooder anyways
<:hehe:926257385285226546>
then i whip out the l21b and light shit up 1km away
my friend told me about their torch thats ''super bright'' . ive kept my mouth shut, so theyll whip out the torch and show me how cool it is
i do actually have a hike coming up in a  week that ill bring them all with for
um
uh
well
ill have flood, throw and a edc light]
bought a S21D, to go with my L21B CULPM and SC31 pro SST-40
bought a new flashlight (quad 219A) and the estimated shipping says itll arrive a month from now BUT its already out for delivery in the UK
lmao
look at estimated delivery
that case is pretty slick
nice
Snip the connector and wire them into the terminal with some ferrules
LoL. F3D does a lot of metal bits for the printer. Mellow on AliExpress also does bits and bobs
Sure is, conclusion was that the gears didn't mesh properly
<@509772297289072653> after the artifacting, what extruder did you settle on using
Honestly, this is just from vez, I'd ask what he settled on. Last I remember though it was a hextrudort
At 5 different speeds. Single wall in harsh lighting
This is on orbiter

ü§î
well if its that easy, ive got tubing and a pump already
just made a simple one
Not sure if it shows idlers
So this from their yt
But is this helpful?
i quite like tinkercad for simple functional parts
Print a PLA spacer that holds the motor out and replace it with petg or abs when the printer works
pro
pla will work at the bottom of the printer for mlong enough to get a good abs replacement
nop
but yeah a couple minuts in cad and a 20m print will save you
ah i see
also not sure if its the photo but the belts doesnt look parralel to the frame
honestly, i would just print a new z mount
I'm telling you this bag of random bolts will save my life
True, enclosure panels from failed prints would be pretty sick
Yeah I'm looking for a old oven to melt my plastics in
UK unfortunately, might carry it with next visit though
I just feel bad sending it to a landfill
I've got a full dresser drawer of old spools and a dresser of new spools and in my shed 5kg of waste plastic sorted by roll of plastic
With words like 'high' 'LSD' and 'speed' in the title vez is gonna get demonitized
yeah sorry man, 6 days til the announcement
nope, unfortanutely thats a bot
Nice
Eyy enough for a serial, good luck on the wires
Looks pretty close to done. Get well soon
How's everyones builds going
I've got the same egg, not so great overhangs tho
Nice
Damn
Makes for a neat show peice
For a fun print, toss a bunny or similar inside of that egg before it finishes
i dont personally have one but the model im making will be printed on one before its casted
hey could someone take a look at a model and let me know if its printable on a resin printer
but njot the original
i saw a remaster of it made with cats
new ones top notch
chocolate raisins, popcorn and jolly ranchers are where its at (honourable mention to minty gum and mint chocolate)
not overly sweet and dont make you feel sick
theyre great
its spiongy and chewy and melts on your tongue
Damn, got a link to where that's from

emjoy the break
whew, i always hate to see regulars disappear <@!402169283167256589>  hasnt messaged since ~500 members
hehe he messaged since then tho
from a month ago
Try a temp tower at the max your willing to print with that slowly drops to the highest you unsuccessfully tried
neat
Alright so unless you have a lot of skipped steps or hit speed limits you're fine to use stealthchop. I personally still prefer spreadcycle and would recommend trying higher microsteps (I used to run 32x on every axis but z and e which had 16x)
Are you looking for high speed <@294858434954788864>
That's probably since the stock board used a higher microstep or had stealthchop
And if you want stealthchop remember it can only be set to always on (999) or always off (0)
Iirc M84 will turn off motors, pit that at the end of macros (if you're okay with rehoming before it can move again)
That's normal for spread cycle
Hissing?
My skr still powers up and fans spin but the MCU will never receive power since the 3.3v line is dead
Look for any damaged components on the board
Put it in a pan with oil and turned onto medium heat
<@908498660441067622>  but of a stretch but any chance the bearings managed to ungrease themselves
Yeah they might be spinning wrong. Are you able to do a force move to try move 1mm on x then 1mm on y
Check the pulley is tightened
Is one motor skipping or slipping or is it spinning on purpose
Did you set the wrong motion system
if the xy is vzbot it counts
i dont think so but not 100% sure
not sure of an exact number
possibly more flex but i havent seena  actual input shaper comparison
slightly lower temp resistance for a couple grams less
the mixed metal and cf f3d one right?
what is your zip code?
''The use of other nozzles is recommended for technical and abrasive materials.''
but also
''Advantages of nickel plating

A nickel coating is applied to the brass nozzles, which protects against dirt, corrosion, erosion and abrasion.

Nickel-plated nozzles have a higher corrosion resistance and a lower coefficient of friction, which allows a smoother material feed and delays the plastic adhesion to the nozzle surface.''  from bondtech on cht
Sure, how can I pay for the shipping
Any wattage, are they like dell PSU where it's not standard or ATX standard PSUs
Man if I lived nearby id love to take more. But just hard drives and if you have one a PSU but don't sweat it if you dont
7 is plenty but if you feel like tossing in anything you want to throw away I'd be happy to have them
How many drives are there? And are they laptop or 3.5 inch drives
Awesome, don't worry about packaging them. Just toss them in. Don't worry about the disk magnets I try keep my projects made from recycled materials
I'm happy to cover shipping. I'm just looking for the magnets so feel free to shatter the platter or however you want to deal with them. Depending on the shipping and if the timing works out then I'm happy to buy
Depending on how many I could buy them off you and have them shipped to family
Is Dallas near Chattanooga or Florida?
needed the magnets and figured the hdd case would be a nice enclosure for some electrnoics so i removed everything
Anyone need some extra storage 
,Ive got 380gb of HDD storage spare

Keeping it low budget i see
We're around the 37 so you'll make jt
does that dissolve glue stick?
for gluestick
and do a little dabbing with the sponge for a textured surface
and heat to 100
use lotsa of water and spread it evenly
It's quite thun when you extruder it (like abs+) and it prints at around 255, I wasn't able to get it to stick to my bed at 60c so it'll probably require abs temps or at least a bit of hairspray. I wasn't able to gut much usable filament from my first run but hopefully today or tomorrow I'll have some time  to experiment
Turned a polypropylene strap used in shipping into extridable filament. The thin white is some ooze, just started a print
all thats left it actually checdking it works
got my project mostly assembled
pretty good

It's got RGB for more.....frames?
<@451709396280410132>
might still count if i squint hard enough while doing the serial
its mos definitely a blessing. especially since im not the fastest builder
i think its roughly 1/2 through high school
ah, are you in america
about to do GCSEs next year
if it can push plastic and move thats enough for a serial (even if its only the first layer)
yeah my weekends are full of projects but ive never got the endergy after school to do much. my first build to 1 year
how close to done are you?
<@!752682782916083772>  about to head to bed, any other issues before i go

put a ''!'' infront of the pin
top is the shortened, file is the klipper docs version
[tmc2208 stepper_x]
uart_pin:
interpolate: false
run_current:
stealthchop_threshold: 0
in the example config?
nice
potentially the wire youre using is broken?
check if theres continuity at the board pins and at the thermistor plug
same temp readout?
and for microsteps i ran 16 with interpolation but thats recently been seen to be bad. so rather raise microsteps til your happy and make sure stealthchop is 0 or 999
and check if it works
ATC Semitec 104GT-2 replace with this
any shorts? and do you have a link to what you bought
i like to start from the generic example from my board and use it to rebuild one thats formatted the way i like it but its all preference, you can start from scratch or use someone elses
everythng on that page should go in your config somewhere
add all of these

Plastic from the bin: even cheaper
Picked it up cut it into chunks and taped it to the printer
75mm foam insulation I found in a skip on my way home from school
Reached 33 degrees ambient
Printed quite a bit of abs from that enclosure
Just be careful with fires. Hasn't happened to me but it's always a risk
I've done one with PVC pipes and a blanket that wasn't terrible
That also works
Or just 2 panels and the other two being a house wall
If you can't find one, a enclosure without a top works well enough ime

shhhhhhhh
why, so close to 3k but people keep leaving

I guess some people left in the past few days
Yes
Hevort supports much higher temps natively
Hevort is more complex and the price reflects that. Both can be fast printers but vzbot ultimately is a little faster
and im too lazy to sort through all of them
then i realised its not alphabetical order
i started trying to write down every username and what they polled on

For a second I thought that was just a poorly executed Jew joke ü§£
Whaddya know, they do exist
I suppose if it's the only different color ten it draws the eye to your print
Bare alum and black plastic
Could do a two tone vzbot
Looks good, if only pei sheets were plain black
The other belt is on the back
You might have done like me and seen the front view only where you can only see 1 of 2 long belts
Looks like if you rotate it and get a bigger printer it'll fit
Did you try rotate it
Oop, bit too high
Tbf if they offer quick shipping for within the country it makes sense to order from them
You can disable the light up taskbar bade thingy if that's what you mean
Read above
I stay online with small popus, just To glance over incoming messages
Nothing malicious then, all fine
Who did the ping?
Adding it tmrw /s
Saw a bot that does that when chat stops being active
That's a shame, I'll move to superslicer then, probably similar settings
ill take a look later
cool, im just blind
my top layers have gaps and the walls are extruding perfectly
can you set flow per feature in prusaslicer
is it your repo?
Ah, cool
Why no interpolation
cool, chop them off and add a cage further away and reduce turbulence
sorry one more, for the rounded edge is there a certain fillet size i should do or just eyeball it
also, any reason not to remove the fan grills, as far as i can tell they just make them noisier
then a proper peice
a quick mockup just so i can get some parts finished
ill try it in pla first then petg after
itll be open air
shizzle, its pretty wide. i dont think ilol be able to get it to not warp
pla
should those be rounded?
on the inner channel the wheels dont get near the end so you can just pull the bracket and tighten the bolts, tons of adjustment
its an idler holder for a cr10s pro for easier tensioning
you guys mind critiquing my design
works great for light gaming and heavy vr
i used to have a funky 3060ti and 3600 both with a light oc in a mb500l
nvm its fine
should i be able to view it in onshape
oh it says its corrupted or unreadable
cheers
oh bruh im an idiot. forgot abt that
CR10S_Pro_V2_Y_axis_Nozzle.stp

Yeah, lots of stuffs can be modified to use any hardware (if you have enough patience) so if that stays cheap and I can make the journey I'll buy it
Yup
and it'd be pretty cool to mess around with
free shizz
even if it doesnt work
yup
maybe its worth buying
hm
it only requires rx tx and 5v+- which a usb carries i think
also, could i connect the gpio on a raspi zerow to usb for communication, since the default ender 3 board doesnt have exposed rx/tx pins i think
that raspiu seems overly expensive
none of that is a good deal is it?
Are you using the board to power the pi? Or an external power sourcr
anyone tried a rpi zerow on a creality stock board, not sure if it can provide anough power
most of the admins are from around there i think
i know theres something about quebec and canda i think
canda iirc
singing
you all missed the best part
although having some techincal difficulty
so now theres an impromptu stream
lmao, vez accidently went live
hehehehe
relatable, ive managed to wiggle my way into 2 admin teams with 0 marketable skill other than 'likes reading discord'
i just wanna see the AWD, i'd like to see if AWD is the next step for coreXY or only useful for heavy gantries
from what ive seen its near release. im less involved with the design and github side of vzbot and more discord but it looks to be soon  <:soon:906671622612742185>
its unfortanute but what can you do
yeah we gotta do that to be a community server, and it keeps out bot accounts
fair enough
*slice engineering
not a comment on their quality as a business, but i can say personally their entire staff was very friendly and patient
ah shipping for the first link i havent checked but the second one
for threaded rod (m5 is what ive tried) and steel sheets B&Q has some very competitive pricing, second best value and best valuable at reasonable size. they do 2 day free delivery
euro car parts has next day pick up
eurocarparts.com/p/triple-qx-multipurpose-ep2-lithium-grease-500g-526770040)
But not for a 3d printer
I've gotta figure out marlin
Have fun
Uh oh
Sounds fun, what broke?
What's everyone up to
Hello üëã
but until i hear more on the commercial and legal issues ill keep shut on those
not sure what the brexit thing is abt
yeah whos gonna install within 20 days and encounter a fatal error
yeah that all makes sense
and ez to reprint
i can destroy one since its a round ring
any way to remove them without too much destruction
ive got two very tight fit press fit prints stuck together
yuup, thats noctus3d
if you play the waiting game on aliexpress you can build for ~30 usd including tools which makes each nozzle dirt cheap after a initial investment
They're part way through refreshing the store
At least they're pretty, eh?
And now I gotta sand them
Cause they were wide and flat
Then printed it in pla
Bruh I designed my parts to print in abs, specifically the press fit parts
Can it dry up in storage
I'm sticking some metal rods to a bearing to a plastic hub
For my case, to glue stuff together that needs to be removed at a later date
Trying to settle a debate
Hypothetically, would you buy a small syringe (4g) of boron nitride for 2 GBP or a full tub (50g) for 13 GBP
either way the ercf doesnt depend on the printer itself much does it
i *think*  maze made one of those but i might be wrong
its not incredibly new but its still pretty fresh, if youd like a more detailed review then the vzbot owners (people in yellow) can probably help
not sure about website
theres a github
ah lol
which video, unless someone adapted the xy gantry to fit a different style z then it should be moving bed
id wait until a few weeks after chinese new year before declaring anything dead
also 
air is usually free
and i suppose it doesnt add much cost
weird but makes sense
yup
pretty cool idea, uses air gaps for really good insulation
from nitram on annex
cool, gyroid it is, and while im here if anyone has tips for making 3d printed gears lmk
both are just biiiig gears
will one be any stronger than the other
its gonna be a slow print at 2hr 12 and 2hr 7 respectively
the honeycomb one is 74g and the second one is 63g
this is for a spool for filament
hey can you guys vote on two designs for me, im stuck between the two. print time aside which one will be best (longevity and appearance)
link?
Going in out of context, if we get one
'god says 25 votes'
also we're at 7/15
thats going in the channel
Ah cool
Hey <@231293854672879616>  what printers do you have
cheers
what kinematic best decribes the ender 5
or 4
just 5 there
total of 6
2 for heater, 2 for thermistor and two for fan
arent there 6 prongs there
and it all happened by chance üòâ
<:hehe:926257385285226546>
Maybe 15
Dunno, I'll ask admin but I'd say over 10
If enough people vote for it I want to make a quotes channel assuming everyone else is happy with it (react to this to vote yes)
LoL did it right after you suggested
Np
Voltage is fairly irrelevant, nearly every motor is fine to 48v and temps is all you have to watch out for
is that a spreadsheeet i could use
ah cool
which gets 0.02 steps per mm
wheres the 60 from ?
ah so the steps per evoltion is 200 since 1.8 degree stepper. so it would be (240/60)/200
or at least whats the math behind it that i would need to do
hey if i want a specific rpm to run on a stepper motor what value would i feed to marlin
some loctite is permanent and some is just like a putty after setting that holds everything down
It's made for 4 belts on the front side, vzbot has 2 on the front and 2 on the back
The ZeroG Eva mount?
im off to bed, ciao
bruh
it gets the job done
mines the cheapest amazon one
this is good for uk and euro
keeps your fingers safe and looks so much more pretty than tape
also if you dont have, get heatshrink. its well worth it
sheesh, get some solder asap
thats how the brass one vez was messing around with is shaped
half the weight from photos ive seen
the metal f3d carriage supports it iirc
ah, he will be using
vez does, no?
ah yeah they do need a bit of weight
theres a time limit, to avoid users claiming serials way in advance
yay and then knarfie will soon have his serial
really sorry <@!329284552243544065>
removed the command thingy
shit
all changed
nice
so it and 25 are available
thats for #24
<@!557220161346600971>
i think most reliable countrr is the channel one
2 more serials
none in progress so you have a bit longer
lemme check
the ncounter is a little wonky
but they might be the 24th register
catalinutzz iirc
xy motion and any variation usually counts
25
aslong as it looks clean enough it gets approved
doesnt need to be fantastic
gotta be printing
fair enough
serial when?
i dont think they will be sent out publicly tho
not sure actually, it was a mix of people who designed it
kinda, the cnc parts arent public afaik but you can try your luck and ask for them
does it run of ac or dc power
what they said. and im not a trained professional, nor do i have any experience with high pressure anything
just to make it look less bomb-ish
the air compressor from a fridge,i want to get one and make a enclosure for it  but i know it'll end terribly
im stuck between grabbing one of these and keeping one in my room but im sure ill end up breaking it ]
im stuck between thinking i should go grab the broken fridge down the road and thinking if i build that ill end up killing myself
That's a pretty big berd air pump
Nice
1+meter x 0.6m x 0.4m
its gonna have to reeeeely big
either way im still waiting for shipping
tbf its unenclosed, im surprised abs prints at all
at least i designed it wrong so i would have had to do this anyways
üòÆ‚Äçüí®
im gonna have to reprint this in 2 halves
my print warped, and somehow stuck well enough to peel up my build plate, and its not amagnetic sheet its a glued down sheet
seeing as the default ender can hit 500mm/s
depending on which stepper, probably
at least its also flame retardant
*pc abs
true, last i was there though it rained near non stop
its not that exact model but theyre all the same
i use a $20 food dryer, just cut the spokes off one tray and plca eit over a normal try to get enough height
although i will mention, lighting from the bottom has (for me) shown defects more drastically
hard to tell since they arent regular id say its random defects in the entire motion system. maybe its from the leadscrew but i couldnt say
oh cool, thats exactly what i landed on, with a cutout from supports in the middle and next to the round columns
anyone see a good way to print this with minimal supports?
esp the buck converter
ah, that'd be pretty cool
as long as its not a ''smart'' breakout board then thats a good idea. i know the annex carabiner (i think thats the name) does something similar
are you dead !?!
did the house explode
did the print fail
but thats pretty difficult iirc
you can try driver tuning
Subtle flex
now try pushing accell
its well worth it, makes quite a difference
1d actually, too much money to invest in a x axis so i just have a z
straight down
oh yeah
baby stepping should fix that
sneak peek
new all metal carriage in development               /sarcasm
might it be the youtube.be instead of youtube.com (dunno what the difference is maybe thats it )
lemme try it
its all fine, ill just stop printing small items in the one same spot, not sure whats with the link tho
shhh that costs money
yeah i might change to bear alum in the center
im 50/50 whether its good por bad
makes printing a pain tho
ikr
sitting at a sweltering 18c
not sure which part does the magic bed breaking but something is going well
now scrape it lightly
heat to 100c, wait for hairspray to dry, wipe water on again, wait for it to evaporate
soak cloth in hairspray and start wiping the bed
wash with soap and a sponge
yup, i see people complain but little do they know my secret
the hole, small rip to its right too
<@!430419896753717248>
thank you for the link. ill keep an eye out
prusa slicer
otherwise it feels like a waste of the bed
do you know if i can set stl's to default to somewhere offcenter
its lasted two years though of printing almost exclusively in the same spot
suffering from success
its a default creality sticker with hairspray
when this print finishes youll see
and video
wanna see photos
im gonna have to replace it with glass or something soon
my bed sticks too well (something i though i'd never say) the nozzle isnt digging in and isnt anywhere near the bed but still my abs sticks well enough to tear the sticker
if the other admins approve can i put this in announcements (credit given)
youtube.com/watch?v=socnXGxqqLI (enable english subtitles, bar refers to filament and tape refers to the cut strips of PET bottles)
yup, need it to be sharp-ish
the red section is what i want to remove to acheive that inward angle
gimme a sec, theres a certain shape cutter i need and a profile i want to acomplish
time wise i can do this really slowly i just need it to be fairly safe
does anyone have much expeirience cutting (presumably) hardened steel with a dremel
and ill have family bring it back
yeah i got mine shipped to the us
oh damn indeed
also on protopasta use code peacelovepasta for a free roll of recycled pla
ü•∫ üëâ üëà ü•∫  for me?
<@!751492479525847111>  welcome back
doing something like this
anyone have any luck 
Otherwise do pid again
Any voltage drop?
its all lies
guys hes lying its actually a nema8 stepper

hey if you're entering dm me your first name and ill look out for you
u want me to forward the links
fair enough
so far theyve made it to the 2nd giveaway
i managed to make it this far but im so exhausted
lol
yup, i rarely pull all nighters cause i hate feeling sluggish but i slept an extra few hours yesterday so im sure its fine
so i can get back to normal
its so im tired by -check notes- 5 pm
ill tell them, its to reset my sleep or smthing
my parents are gonna be pissed, at least it holidays
idk
lateast i will do is maybe 5
yup
last
i just need to know how long its gonna
if the shipping is fast enough i might be able to have my brother take it back to the us and ship it but no promises
you pay shippimng?
ive got a hand saw
hand it over
HELLO
:üò≤
LOL, IM STRUGGLING AND THERES STILL A FEW HRS LEFT
i might saty up for it
stupid america giveaway
although soem homes are 240
usa is 120v
Hey same, finally bit the bullet and I'm starting sourcing
<:wesmart:890660011531989072>
at least the afterchonker is well balanced
sheesh
fairluy certain thats what vez's entire gantry weighs
thinking it was slow down if above 10000s
swo set a 'slow down when below 100000s'
didnt want it to slow down when layer time was too long
oh im a idiot
on the right is what i sliced last night, on the left i sliced again. hows there such a disparity in time
im gonna go do that
yup, and when your frantically searching through a house with grey carpet it doesnt help to have it on a box on a shelf
try Spot the micro sd
finally found it, it was on this box and i only found it becuase i was gonna go put it away and it fell off
i had it a minute ago
bruh ive lost my microsd card
because kevlar line/ steel wire isnt too expensive
would adding the string at the nozzle be a good way to support a super volcano
mmmmmmm cancer
i might print a case for it that has a larger tank
you can fill the tank with whatever you want
i mean
smoke machine
no
if i buy a fan and a camera ill rival the show
i hope quality is terrible because it was just uploaded
<@329284552243544065>
alr, lemme finish my game and ill show you
me?
i tested first with duct tape and a huumus box and it worked so i did some cad and got this
either you blow into a small hole at the bottom or you pull air through the hole
thats where the fan comes in
i can always half the fan speed to 9v by using 1 instead of 2 9v batterys
i cant tell if both your first messages are sarcastic or not
and ducts
fan testing
And since the fan sits at the top I can mount hose adapters or anything else k want. It makes AA solid amount of smoke and is nice and light
Smok rpm 80 pro adapter for making tons of smoke with the press of a button
ill send a photo in 1hr when the rest of the project finishes
it still prints beatifully
damn, after neglecting my cr10 for 3 months and barely tuning it AND switching slicer from cura to prusa slicer
dm nitram or buy a clone from mellow]
also pretty cool
i dont think theres anything else i was waiting for to leave testing so i can build
imma buy it and the f3d parts
get in
Probably both
chances are they dont have any stock yet and just have those listings to garner more sales
probably
imitation is the best form of flattery
welp
the rest of their channel has similarly cool ideas
pretty cool
ah perfection
i see what you mean
oh phew
hope so
itll probably be fine but if its eays its probably best to wiggle
thats uh not fixed, maybe theres not enough wiggle room but thats pretty angled
ah yeah, they looks slanted up and down
it looks like the camera lens, you mind putting something flat next to the belt and getting a pic
It looks like chatter I think
The bottom is dull and the top has tiny indents in it
Just wanted to ask, is the bottom plate molded and the top machined
Cool, that's a ton of power
No no, the server supply (at least the one I have) should carry multiple voltages and different amps
And 1 amp of 12v extra
True but those server supplies usually also carry around 5 amps on 5v power
Careful, might melt itself
How many watts is it?
<@!873212295684173904>  if youre in the uk i can send you a passive cooler or a cpu cooler for that guy
i was hoping that was to funnel air and not for a proper build
Also, it's spec sheet may say to limit it to 1500Ma at 12v or something alike- that's there to stop it melting itself
Ah a COB LED, what are you using to drive it, also what heatsink and thermal paste is on it
yeah true
i wonder if having a really powerful 12v psu can be stepped up to 48v while having enough power to work
And the speed is what makes it cool
Claiming the underextrusion is just rustic and retro
Do you think in 20 years there'll be hippies using single gear extruders talking about retro tech and using those clicky wheel screens
Wdym
It's a amogus
amogus
Looks like if you switch to a smaller motor you could fit another 5015
Yay
Gonna go see spider-man
not that im aware of, so its more of a redundancy, really just different
theres not a whole ton of difference since both wok but it also can just be for design/aesthetic reason
holds the belt on better for less slipage
do you have a photo
or they use them for easy tensioning]
potentially like voron they could route them all to one  side
yup, its all random shops that make knockoffs
everyone else has too
2 doors down from me has fiber optic but my house doesnt
i get 50 up and 50 down
lucky you
Next time dm
Ah sorry
hey you got the spam role, you want me to remove that?
yup
you know where to find me
if theyre looking for beta testers
have you seen the speed boat thing before?
these guys build really fast printers
hello
<@!683305601253769227>
many
to
way
theres too many quotes
now i want one
damn thats awsome
<@329284552243544065>  put 8mm of spacers under the mount and cut down the leadscrew if it needs it but it shouldnt
yeah, sucks to be hamilton
oh at the end
looked fair to me
i had my cable come loose after a while
is it connected via ethernet or wifi
can you connect through putty
same wifi?
i trust ya not to look  if you arent <@!410559448306679810>
and send it to my address at ||lol im not doxxing myself twice||
buy a box
you can package it up
do you have  any smooth idlers touching the belts teeth
tldr hes a monkey üêí
i might just add a duct over a desk fan, not sure tho, ill have to compare specs
cpap for takeoff
berd air for quick on off responsiveness
yup, im gonna try a berd air at the hotend and a big cpap aswell
if it doesnt spit or cool plastic i dont want it on my hotend
true but annex seems to have it down pretty well
yeah that hotend swings **low**
all the weight on the red side none on blue
but im no pro
the toolhead looks unbalanced
it looks pretty strong until you see the toolhead
your friend is what we ''professionals'' call a 'schmuck'
yeah
like larger than a person
i was mistaken, it was just a reallly huuuge 220v motor i saw
whats the chances the motor just shorts
good luck to your friend
expensive
theres a driver
but theyre slow
220v styeppers exist
just asked dalegaard for his opinion
they would need lots of torque and probably woulodnt be safe
and 220v will require serious cooling
he does know that adding voltage only helps to a certain degree
fire
mmmmm
right into the wall
plug it straight into ac
sounds good to me
no one setting is universal
true, if youve got the time to spare tho mayaswell try it
try .48 line width
and what size nozzle
whats your line width
both
And before we list a ton of useless fixes, what have you tried so far
Have you tried changing flow, up and down
And now thanks to knarfie we get a bot that does some work for us
Total maybe 8 or so
But that's unusually high
2 this week
Aw thanks, I do try to be fast but I always forget to kick them so I'm just deleting the same message over and over
For now we'll just have to be quick with the kicks
yup
yup
great deal (asuming shipping is okay) for those around hong kong
bruh moment
and very lightweight looking
beatiful
teste
whats ur channel link
ill remeber that ^
welp, at least it wont count to my final grade
apparently eenie meenie minie mo is wrong
ah shucks, definitely got price wrong, was trying to decide between cost weight or strength as the answer
Ah cool, I think we'll end up re doing this test since we havent covered half the topics
Middle school chemistry
I don't think it would be the grain structure since we haven't learnt that yet, anyways, thanks for the help
Alright, I said alum was stronger than copper and that steel is also stronger than cast iron
Why is steel used instead of 5% carbon cast iron for a pylon
And
Just had a science test today and not sure if I got the right answer, would someone mind answering it here. The question was:. Copper and aluminum are conductive, why is aluminum used instead of copper in over head wires (power lines)
<@!557220161346600971>  you can now
The only place anyone else uses 2fa is Fortnite
Like the Xtra minute I'd worth jt
No one else does
I'm the only one in my family to do it
Just dm it to me at this point
You Know what, to be safe just send him you social security number and you full address and mother's maiden name and full credit card details
<@302585836141150208>  are you ok, we're here for you during these unprecedented and troubling times
Ah holy shit guys what do we do
Nice
It's usually steel plates right
ah cool
damn it just gets better and better
are you gonna add any quick dis/connect
ah man your printer is so cool
for the sake of cleanliness have you considered one thiccc tube with a thinner berd air tube in the middle that every wire sits inside of
also is it dd or bowden
makes sense, will it continue to have that 'wireless' look or will the berd air tube have to be exposed
well, thats awsome
but it works?
thats really impressive then
either way thats an impressive amount of time to finish in. did you have most of the parts on hand
my first build took a year
not bad
How long was the build
Fhesses mount for bowden+nitrams stiff bowden would be godly
Ask nitram, he uses a Bowden at high speed
Ah, nice
Looks pretty cool
Hey it's the person himself. I'd love to see a few more photos in <#857156984150163488>
Ahhh, I thought that was above the toolhead
Ah, I see it now
But that's a lot of effort with terrible access for repair
Ah , in the name of perfection you could have the SSR and all the mains at the base and PSU at the bottom and route the power needed at the top through the holes in extrusion
Ah nice, I love the look with one big central unit, how's the wiring done. Is it all in the top with just a wire to the bed or is it mainly at the base
Oh is that your reddit post? <@711462550071541770>
pretty good
about 2/3 of the move is at top speed
whats the distanbce ut moves
does it pass mazes speed test
is it even moving
idk man looks a little slow
And I think those brackets are from vzbot but I can't tell
Pretty cool delta
Nobody knows I'm an infant on the internet
16 more akshually
Wooo
We made it past 2k
Yipeeeeee
hm
just do every other or every 3 holes
no need if it grabs its fine, maybe use some threadlocker and check its fully clamped in
woooohoo
try it ig
probably
just test it on a spare extrusion and check the screw doesnt tpuch the frame
yeah probably
m3*12?
<@287357528780570625>  I think you've misread it, it says 80 communicators and 308 visitors (people who just lurk)
And those people messaging changes fairly often
Ah that's just individual users, messeges are higher
50 what's?
howww
50 different users message per week last i checked
true, peak online is 500
and it w\s a rubbing belt
only black
same here
yeah its gotta be more fan, lowering temp didnt work and extra heating didnt help me either
np, it confused the heck out of me
stront gezicht
hehehehe
Does the cooling fan ramp up there since  it's a overhang?
That guy helped birth One of the most beloved hotends and nozzle standards
I'll assume freak accident
That guy was awesome. He left too soon
Oh shit I only saw the image and thought it was another blog
I'll probably just pull the trigger and build one
Relatable
<@202189639593754624>  how's the speaker build going
yeh
ball head hex key thingy]
yeah except teachers dont record them unless you ask, and hgave covid
bruh
Cheers
Anyone know what voltage a xhp 50 LED requires, I'm thinking of using it for the ol printer
defaults should be fine, in your config you mind forwarding your mesh fade settings
yeah, whats you bed mesh config like
You mind trying again and watching if the leadscrew moves, If the motor moved and if the bed moves
Fittings plus tube
Im adding that rigid Bowden to the list of things to do. So I'll test the retraction difference if it's big I'll make a big post Abt it
earliest shipping for me is 2 weeks
really good
bruh 5 - 9 day shipping
^this u looking for money after buying the minis
ur wallet rn
cause i was a bit monkey brained üêí  üß†  i bought the parts as i needed them and got no spares
my first build took a year and 2 months
good luck and have fun!
why not put buck conv and fan at the top on top of the pi or near the pi

Voron finally just announced a new Afterburner, named Stealthburner. To summarize it's a AB-BN30, low poly, with 3 leds (two near the nozzle and one on the logo), and clockwork 2 (they finally moved to a round 10t nema 14). Since there is a 5015 fan and a smaller motor now they removed the cable cover and integrated everything behind a door inside the printhead. They also decided to build two small ducts to redirect just a little bit of air from the hotend fan to the cooling ducts, to prevent them from melting when the part cooling fan isn't working.
lol me neither
that makes more sense
ah alright i though you mesnt pla outside and cf pa inside
melt point maybe not, theyd have to be alittle similar like abs and polycarbonate. otherwise ye itd be pretty good
Very cool nonetheless
Not a 'smart' method
Dual color extrusion
Why's the 4010A at the bottom, you just get longer cable length, no?
dont worry, ive seen sellers run out then half prices so it looks liek you missed somehting good
<@451709396280410132>  do you know much about flashlights or Lion chargers

maze explained it a while back but 5.1-5.2v is bets if youre using the sd card slot
voron stylized corexy
Probably but no promises
but modified
yep
otherwise diy imo
depends, if x5sa is cheaper then go for it
most of the limits are from saggy extrusions or saggy cf tubes at extreme legnths and the massive belt length
ah yeas bed size 400mm
but its reccomended to stay below 400mm on x iirc
but size is nearly infinitely expandable
x5sa fram format should be followed for both zerog and vzbot
kinda
I'm in both ZeroG and vzbot so I'm happy whichever you choose. I will say both are very different projects
Greetings
heres a comparison of all the different configuration, watch through once then close your eyes and pause on the best sounding one
also seems like a subwoofer helps a lot so im reusing one i found in storage, but its not eccesary
heres the best pins i could find for mounting, uless you already have
to connect you need some banna plugs which you can buy from amazon basics for 6 bucks
well the one in my cart is from the yt video i watched. ill link it since its much more concise and i prefer the format
yup, both diyperks and techingredients feel like theyre 'diy' but have no docs or guides. more like its the kind of diy you watch to feel motivated then never do
i will say avoid amazon for amps if you can, from the few i looked at aliexpress had them at half the price for the same unit
Weird
Depends what exciter you put on it is the tldr
What's the issue, not that I would know the fix, but may as well be aware of it
Ah nice, I'm following the same idea but from a different youtuber
oh how3s it going, what tutroial are you following, if any?
i like how it fills the room, might try mount it with 4 wires in the rafters above me for a 'speakerless' but room filling sound
i might be building one of those flat panel speakers tho
nah im no audio freak. those headphones tho are veery lightweight and i need soemthing for my walks home thats nice and cheap
the earbuds at the top usually cost a whopping 6usd and the sale records it previously being 40usd
the fosi amp has been 'discounted' from '¬£65' but only 24 hours ago was priced at 43
only purchase a item you would normally buy at this price
do not buy under the pretense that this is a big discount
many sales are not worth it
quick warning for sales today
cheers
also which of these would be ebst for drilling a .8-0.6mm hole in a nozzle
whats the difference betweena  cnc router and cnc mill
a brush holder?
good, thanks for the replies
your school is a specialist one, right?
asked a dt teacher if i could use the drill press, got told "in short, no" and then they closed the door in my face
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
e.g a drill press
<@!784092758187966524>  and anyone else whos in school, does your school let you use their tools for personal projects
they found a way to get rid of employees junk
Yeah ik that one. Costs quite a bit to export tho, no?
Huh I got terrible resolution from it
Are you using scanect pro
Oh same here. I've got the 1.8 dev kit
Which connect, I've got one from 2016 or 2017
I'm using windows developer kit to scan
Hehe, how'd you get such a crisp scan
Now that I've got a PC to support it I figured I'd try a few scans of rooms and such
Trying a Xbox Kinect
Just a quick test scan of my dad
üòä
does anyone know if 500mb is big or normal for a obj 3d scan
yup
just mention its non official
yeah theres nothing wrong with that title, include a image or two and i dont see why not
yeah if you want to advertise that go for it
yup, no official branding. but feel free to send a 'taster kit'   üòâ  üòâ
true. anyone feel free to do that
two tychos
or two more really fast ones
<:soon:906671622612742185>
my phone asks me to verify who i am on this server
sometimes it takes a minute to load anyways
is it connected to the internet
m2.5-m8 or m3 to m6
can somone reccomend a good tap/die set thats around 15-20 bucks
i can be 2 foundational walls from my phone and get a good connection
can you get a plan view
true
dunno how to dexribe it but a expanding and contracting ring that holds the screw maybe
yeah i guess the screw wouldnt bite
also omnia drop is pretty good for flexibles
would the screw not work for that
well tbf we wont know  until its working
ooh sale for 4 bucks on black friday, ill buy the headphones then and the nozzles now
cool, ill probably get both then. my walk is 30m there and 30m back so i would charge them over other day
might get both and some parts for a speaker, or just one and speaker parts
see thats the thing, i would use the headphones 5/7 days a week to and from school but the nozzles would be fun, i think ill get both tbh. gotta wait til monday to decide
im using them to make my own high flownozzle, so theyre gonna get maimed and 'modded'
ah shizzle, its 50/50 for votes now
alright its come down to www.amazon.co.uk/Pieces-Printer-Extruder-Makerbot-Different/dp/B07D721WH3
thanks
buy a cheap pair of bluetooth heaphones for walking home : a magnetic bowl for screws ; 16 nozzles to maim and try to DIY a hf nozzle
someone help me choose
im indecisve
Especially for prusas all in one, no nonesense printer
So the price isn't terrible
I will say that there's a ton of extra hardware in that printer than an equivalent vzbot in size
With dual extruder
It's a big boy
Final point about that new prusa, it's not aimed at us, yes it could go fast and yes it might be wonderful for a prosumer but in schools where they went print and leave it is where I think it'll excel
oh nice
ohh, are you going
where are you meeting him?
maybe using a stm32 for a second tiny board near the toolheads to reduce cluuter but i dont like the on toolhead stm32
makes more sense than a stm 32
yup
well nothing really, other than a tmc drive ron the toolhead which is unnesecary imo, they should rather do something carabiner esque which just reroutes one big cable into printer io
and if that toolboard gets heated (which it would in a chamber) life wont be too fun
my biggest concern is if they use a stm32 on each toolhead theyre gonna run out quick
yeah true, and the hint  at klipper is nice
its a huge change
otherwise i really love the bed
and the enclosure thingy doesnt cover the toolhead which is kinda crappy
otherwise i think its a solid printer for schools or less budget constricted users
the smooth idlers a bit meh
<@209767145582624768>
i think so, although another experimental toolhead exists til vez tests useing mgn7h/mr7
Purple is very popular for schools
Mines  purple and black
A pruple gantry and gold toolhead with purple accent would be bussin. Although the plain purple is pretty good anyways
It'd be dope on a display peice or on a i3 where speed is no bother
It'll be within +-2 degrees (or something like that)
So for a heatsink the difference doesn't matter
hey <@!451709396280410132>  (or anyone that knows) does anodized aluminum have a higher thermal conductivity then un anodized alumin
pretty cool, but i wonder if theres any flow improvements
figured we'd ping you since once you get the new role of a owner you wouldnt be pinged again
pretty cool, i cant think of any real uses but cool nonetheless
If by üî• you mean great you would be correct. The doc says my brain damage might be linked to huffing PTFE fumes but the hell does he know. (This is sarcasm and PTFE is nasty shit)
so expensive
Well everything I read on the internet is true, thanks for the advice
well i have been looking to be more efficient
<:wesmart:890660011531989072>
lol
id assume their work or direct from manufacturer
ez, apply magic goop to te belts
same here, didnt even occur to me that it might even exist
big grow tent and normal man or tiny man and normal grow tent
<@!410559448306679810>  trying to look for his teensy printer is the very normal grow tent
looks small, get a size bigger
but that seems a little drastic
considering @ everyone
just updated into external announcements
3:40 today
<:wesmart:890660011531989072>
i forgot to check mine and had to do some hackjob soldering
even if you invert the pin? also there is a physical pin onb the driver right
~1mm
does it start moving then stop
otherwise after 12 im looking at 9 or later for delivery
if i order by 10am i can get it by 12-2
even i wasnt that dim on my first build
oh boy
im not sure how to do those ngl
<:this:906674932509978624>
cool
red or green
what colour
getting it
added
forgot that one
<:doubt:906671643819118633> <:mildpanic:906671521647448124> <:thonk:906671607232200756> <:soon:906671622612742185>  added a few more emogis
theres 3 centers 20m away from me
im a shmuck
never mind
it just depends
it massively depends what time of day you order it but a lot of my orders arrive within the day i order them (i order before 10am usually) but i dont live too near a distro center
But don't worry, you can either ask Devin to manually add it (if that's possible idrk) or wait patiently
üåÖ good morning
And it may pass, it depends
If you want a low number you can open a ticket and reserve the number (as long as you provide proof of the printer)
Right click and press copy image and send it here and I'll turn it into an emote after school
Without worrying about lowering temps
If you do make the outer one pump air through a filter
just @me to add any emote, we have ~90 spots open
<:gaming:905957578226430042>
added a gaming one too
im lazy
shhh
<:growtent:905956892268974170>
<@!410559448306679810>
<:VECTOR:905954448550010931>
just added this one
<@!410559448306679810>
send a image of one and i think i can add it
would be cool if its fixed with this
i hope so
looks like doubled ended slanted gears for reasons
but in theory yes
but my spool is more than a year old so ymmv and its sitting on a huge heated metal plate
yeah i print it no enclosure and cranked fan
good or bad
so
pink
pink is smexier
Nn
Anywho
But the orbiter had added bulk and complexity for the sake of it
Potentially more flow from the lgx lite and for speed the sherpa
Why not Sherpa or lgx lite when it release, over the orbiter that is
Looking forward to that serial
Ayyyy
Sorry it isn't enough for everyone
Yet
From my understanding there's b type 2020 and another type, it works for one not the other
Depends
Mmm
You could print some spacers temporarily
Eek, wrong 2020 profile for mgn9
So have I, what'd you do
We should just ban <@500079262460674059>
Well now I've made a fool of myself
Shuuuut up moooom your gonna embarrass me in front of all my friends
I would join but ive got some sleeping to attend to
Vc is always open
Shhh
Wanted to see if q and a and podcasts would work on there (nothing is planned for those I was just thinking)
I'm really sorryz but yeah I was testing
I'll go make an announcement
Ohhhh shiiiz
Did people get notified for that
Oh no
Always a second chance
So I mean
Well it happens fairly often
It was midnight and sleep deprived me was not amused
I slept on it funny so no feeling or movement in the arm for an hour
Welp I've lost feeling in my arm before and thouh my arm straight up fell off so losing a rail is acceptable
The big long shiny metal sticks?
Uh
so that allows for a lot of different structured vc
well i know now you casn join without becoming a speaker and average users can requets to speak on the stage
i just wanted to see how the structure worked, comparing admin vs averae user perms
impromptu or not
at least we know everyones happy to join for events
im sorry
theres 10 peeps in there
oh nooo i joined the stage to see how it worked with a title of test and everyones joined expecting something
NO I NEVER LEAVE CAPS LOCK ON, WHY DO YOU ASK
im bri'ish innit bruv
i am the bus
prepare the gas mask bois its PLA FUMES
hey im not the chump with glued hands
bruh just get out a high grit sandpaper on a dremel and no more superglue
just sand it off
üóø
i can get out my bottle so you can see what it looks like but it will be in english
gotta say dry
the one that says specialist dry ptfe
happens at high res on well stacked prints
funky camera effect and post processing on the phone i presume
looks really clean
theres afew but nothing great
just get the balls exposed, no need to fully disassemble with a thinner oil
and apply a thin amount on a wipe and wipe it along the entire rail
then roll it to the other end and do the same
left and right tracks on the block
assuming you cleaned them properly, just roll it to the end so the balls are showijng and pop it in both sides
are they already mounted to the printer
yup
i did partially fix it with shorter screws, had one slightly too long but it may have bine coincedental
<@!602332031090819095>  ive got that at 75-87mm/s
And I love that beefcake cooling
<@753353703439859740>  that build is C L E A N
might vary
your mileage
ymmv but you mayaswell try
also what plastic
but it would need to be very flat
i suppose
i use too high screws with holes that bottom out with nylon spacers
phew]
i thought you were responding to the photo of vez's kid for a sec, then i checked the image
adorable üòÑ
Yep, I'll process it once I'm home, or someone else might get to it
Not wasted then eh üòù
Functionally it'd the same
Apart from a few features, yes
Use kiuah and install both. Kiuah is a 2-3 cmd install
Mainsail for mouse and keyboard
Fluid is good, I like it for mobile or small screens
By bullet, fall or beating
Mates it's literal death

Based on a child's gamd
First episode has mass murder via snipers
Not for kids
for context since the previuous messages were deleted, a render was shared, ||nunya || requested it was kept private and the rest will be released this friday
that video is private
abs tho should just csause minor respiratory issues, whatch joels video for a visual example of its impact
but ptfe is nasty shit
abs i havent loked into
that was ptfe fumes
wait i made a mistake
keep small things above the ground and well ventilated
keep in mind birds were dropping dead near those fumes
tisnt my idea. its diemexs
try some cardboard with fine sand to get rid of that. similar to in the lil sgt chonky
hm, perhaps i should replace my case fan with one of those
Look at this guy. To much of a monkey to have a drawer
You're just jealous cause I don't have to touch no plebian drawer handle
It's mostly to use spare bits and bobs
I'm gonna connect it to the printer
Ussing the linear slides in a printer to make a tool drawer that opens itself
Awsome
I mean mostly for smaller sizes
And the plug is the right size
Doesn't matter size or cables as long as RMS is set riht
Any stepper can work from a a4988 driver right
Which brand are the ones in the bon now
ah, will add now
i was told theres no change in hardware but i dont handle any designs
thanks
ah well if you just untaped it for the serial we would be none the wiser
i would pass the serial but i dont think the other admins would, you might waqnna get something more permanent
Dear <@&894651349298475038>  and <@&891629031349420032> , we are very happy to see all of you here :-). As we are currently updating the design, we would like to know why you choose the VzBot over other printers and what is your favorite feature. We don't want to change your favorite feature, so we would be very happy to read your responses
if it gets to hot and turns off you just add cooling and they should be fine
F
is there any damage
if you pull out the driver and look at it
howa the physical driver look
its good for the lungs       source: trust me bro
If you see it says port 2_1/2_2 to refer to a two part port
bruh i got a detention for walking to the bin while the teacher was playing a video
But still
It is a  British school and most of the school aren't local
lucky, no one gets to leave m school
but you can leave???
oh phew 40 here
we cant leave school until 330 or 145 on a friday (and we have to stick around for lunch on fridays)
how long is y7our lunch
bruh, we really gotta swap school
~1mm i think is ok though as you can use skew correction to mitigate it
yes, try get them as close as possible for a square frame
Damn that's huge
Gn
For now I would try installing kiuah and then deleting klipper and reinstalling it. Get backups of everything first tho
I've gotta sleep but I can vc tomorrow afternoon or 15hrs from now and continue trouble shooting
In text it means roughly. In klipper I'm not sure
Try a home speed of 5
The nozzle
Is it touching the bed during homing
So what's your z probe
You mind sending it as a image
Hey Im on mobile and can't read a .txt file
I'm sure it will be something obvious and we're just missing it
Let's see the full cfg
Yeah g28 x capitals or not
Forcemove cmd
Don't use buttons
Try manually entering home x
Hm
And the physical wires are right
Yeah it's either gotta be 999 or 0. Otherwise it gets funky
Can't believe I missed that
Just be ready to stop it
Also power the sgthrs to 60
Then try
Turn stealthchop to 0
Oooh
And the stepper buzz command works
Mine came without one so I soldered on a new one
Is it physically there
Also drop that sensorless home speed to 25 and when you do tune it use clippers equation for it and not guess work
Also mb forgot Abt that
Do you have a diag pin
Why not
All fixed after that
Yeah just invert all the pins in config
yeah that makes sense
ah nice, are you 16
what job do you work
your package will arrive soon ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
lol my typing is atrocious too
re pugging, i should try that. been wanting a pug for a while
which worked
IF STILLO NOTHING CHECK THE LOGS
do a full hard shutdown
check the serial port is good
oh, bruh
if there are ill be swapping for my a levels
i dont think theres any even in london
and that was a month ago
it took my mum messaging them to even ask if people would want a engineering club
bruh my schools meant to be stem specialist and we get fuck all engieering support
hashahahah, funny one
both are good contestors
yeah theyre good, usongshine is mazes go to, i trust his opinion the most
which brand rail
you mind resending it
hey <@!822479329215774720>  your discord link has expired
looks pretty clean
judging by size, octopus or spider or btt pro
i think its for a board
thank you
possibly created via fdm
as a professional i would say thats a mount
Yeah I thought you meant like a pinboard üìå
I don't know sorry
Ohhh
To stick stuff into
Corkboard
I was looking at a voron one that uses PTFE tubes on the top to smooth the rolling
Our RE department is humongous tho
We have a team of 4 that got no support for a engineering project. Out of AA school of 2500+
Can we swap schools ü•∫
I will be asking about expanding our program
Hahahah we have one ultimaker, it's neglected beyond salvation
I could ask about a young builder/member role
Slathered on
It looks like acrylic paint
It's not even sanded and filled then sprayed
And painted parts is eek
Value
That's awful vlue
Wut
so id excuse the cables
all my wires are just a bit too short to look nice
cable managment is very difficult on a budget
i wanna get a good look at it
is there any broll of the printer
C'mon guys just 2 weeks of wearing a a mask ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
any minute now ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
stuff ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
That's not great
The belts aren't aligned?
i dont see it?
wheres it show your points, i wanna see mine]
üëÄ
just had to avoid some infills
got nice corners too
it went alright for me
i used to set it to the same as my wall speed
klipper cuts out those stops but jerk is instant change in velocity iirc
where the belts wrap around, on bearings. are those 'toothed' or smooth
<#832686227190054982>  perhaps
it always sounds so dramatic but its so underwhelming, the weather is decidedly a drama king
its like the weather tries to avoid coming on too strong and offending everyone
its 'cold' but nothing under ten and its rained all day but only light drizzle
mild weather
uh
we have
its also indonesian apparently
is it the same word for all 3 languages?
lol in hebrew the word pizza is written ◊§◊ô◊¶◊î which is phonetically pronounced pee-za

nah, youth youth
can confirm,  am youth
hello 'new here', im dad
hi
well theres 6 registered serial tickets on this server and theres gonna be people who arent on the server or anywhere to get registered
lol he fixed it
ah, apparently its got a massive flow boost
hows the max flowrate
Had anyone got their hands on abs max from esun?
someomne out there opened it, took one look and said 'fuuuuuuck, i cant build this' and sent it back
its a work of art
the thinker
im thinking of selling my first printer in exchange for a better more modern one
direct driver or bowden and with which hotend setup?
the voron toolhead
A B, for afterburner
Possiblly. I'm hoping they collabed a little behind the scenes
and for flow characteristics
dont you need that long duct though
(if you want to talk to someone who uses it regularly I know maze uses it)
Sounds like dimafix should work for holding down the part
What's build plate
He keeps sticking out his hips and leaning forward. I think he's just fidgety but it does look quite funny
Is it enclosed and heated. The bed doesn't need to be but the chamber should be
'we're not a 300 dollar hotend company'    ouch
oh and  a copper base but you couldnt see it on screen
and theres the obsidian nozzle
if you click share you can tick a box that links to the time ur at
link to correct time
unless im mistaken its a PTC ring heater
yep
i dont like the 'released at later date' it sounds like theyre doing a drip feed to build hype  and with e3d originally being quite proud of opensource now having patents feels a little wonky
'If your nozzle becomes blocked or jammed, simply swap out for a new one'    haahahahahah, better get planting my money tree
dunno what OP is being payed tho
i really dislike the design
i saw it in croxy and figured i'd share

<@!451709396280410132>   
with mgn7 the rails would bend
If it's a filament you would keep in a dryer anyways why not but beware of the enclosure temp getting too high and malting the plastic
Sorry. Wood and acrylic is all I'll cut I meant
Alright. Metal and wood then
Would you be able to estimate how much a basic CNC that can cut metal would cost
First i gotta find the money's for a vzbot
as far as i can tell its pretty good, but i have 0 experience with this medium
if i only i could afford
yeah, not sure what was happening there
most of the play on my printer is terrible mounts
check the mount doesnt have any play
ah, i might have to check  that out
where do you buy it from
yup, used e5 can be very cheap, i got a fully working one refurbed for 100 plus shipping
<@!451709396280410132>  was the one to tell me this but i think you can buy and ender 5 and rotate it but im not sure if its 100% compatible
im still saving for my 3rd build
lucky bugger
nice
says website is under construction, did i get the wrong one or is it WIP
awesome, i hope it all goes well
<@!412472500266467363> , didnt know you were a vendor, whats your store name
Unless it's it's inside a recess. Then the other type looks better imo
dont think so, its the brass+coating
but yeah any cf filament will chew through that splitter
weve inovated most things other than nozzle geometry, would be nice to see a change
imagine cold pulling it
clogs
it is that
oh yeah my bad
microswiss
also could slap that new trifurcated nozzle from microswiss on there
yup, it uses nema17 instead, i wonder if a servo/larger nema17 would give enogh extra flow to the extra weight added
yeah its fairly similar, just a little better for high flow hotends
'sherpa heavy' the extruder
ah true, so my bearings and rails would get rekt but there wouldnt be any other way to do it
and i thought the consesus was thick grease is great for longevity and thinner grease for high speed on steppers
i would think if whatever you're using has the torque for 6m/s it can slug through a thicker grease
how come?
for the rails ceramic bearings would be neccesary and probably a thicker grease
all this is theoretical though, itll be a year minimum before i get close to this
and sherpa heavy
it would have to be a .5-.6 nozzle and .15 layer height with a 0.4 line width
honestly it would have to some stupid 3-4 stage volcano
it would only be for demos really, just to hit something stupid like 4-6m/s and 200k accel on a square and 8 cooling fans
ive always wanted to gear up for more speed and less resolution (on servos). it would look awful but you could hit such high speed/accel it wouldnt even matter
make sure you get it fgrom, someone goof
i tried some cheap no name fr4 and it was warpy and awful
tell us how it goes, i always love watching stuff like this
would you say this happens often or is this fairly rare
aw sick, guess ill start looking out for a deal like this
holy sh*t, where do you find that kind of stuff
interesting, is it yellowish?
what lube
damn is that smooth
try upload it to imgur and paste the link
Nah looks fine to me üòÇ
your point still stands though, acceleration and rpm are means to an end but colloqiually speed refers to rpm. also nice new pfp
speed is both rpm and acceleration. both get a done speedier in some occasion
no problem
and hv stepstick from mellow
alright, overall impact of high voltage is speed but im not sure what the exact cause is (i reccomend asking in annex engineering for more info). unfortanutely the octopus and similar are designed for a max of 29 volts are so are tmc2209. theres a power board in development by maze (the admin) and that goes under the stepstick or you can get a aux board by ikirin iirc who makes the supernova
there are slower and higher inductawnce .9s and low inductancce 1.8s
*abillitity to possibly go faster
Wdym, a serial number?
<:pogcry:844138461186752563>
Oof, ill definelty grab one then, although my berd air are going to sit in a unheated chamber, i might just end up water cooling them though
Damn that looks good, i cant wait to build my berd air
For now im trying to build a square glass enclosure for the cr10s pro
A really old beta of the zero g corexy and a cr10s pro. Ill be building a vzbot once i can get a job and im gonna maily focus and getting both my printers looking good then focus on the rest
Ah yah mellow are great
Especially when a plastic part that looks meek and flimsy is impossible to break in your hands
Nice, high temp is always cool to see
Ah build plates are always a pain, the duets i suppose were just better back when this was built or was it just most suitable and is the water cooling just because its inside an enclosure
Looks rad, the box on the left is air cooled electronics?
Oh nice, with hindsight is there anything you would do different or is it near perfect for you?
Nice, have you built a hevort?
Sup
Otherwsise they should be nearly the same
Check it hasnt snagged anywhere
partially but when it expands and has no where to move it'll warp
but thats mostly to allow it to expand instead of bowing when heated
kinematic*
everythings chinese, just depends on who you buy from and how much you pay
like this
Yup. Awsome material but if your a speed freek a light abs is more suitable
Although it weights more than a plain abs
OO LAH LAH
Ah nice
Lol wish i had a cnc, although i will be attempting to build one
Yo <@!323961338412138497>  you have becme famous^
2209 is pretty much standard, 5160 is if you want more speed or dont like cooling fans
it will stay cooler and may not need a fan, it also has a High Voltage version for those who need it
Linear rod or bearing?
Theres a guy on annex who offers free sims whos job is fluid dynamics stuffs
Simulation
I would try that guy on the annex server and dutchdude's method to add 'layers' into a 3d model, try one smooth and one layered and do the guys fluid/flow test
Ah cool
Bridge settings possibly or skin or bottom layer try line direction on all of them
unless you use 2 microswitches its kinda ass
I'm guessing resolution or to stop the heavy bed from falling on its own weight
2a peak should not be standard run current
Havr you calculated the proper rms
nAh LoOkS nOrMaL tO mE
Inspect
Potentially, yould run voron z and bed and adapt the xy of vzbot
Instead of being stuck with whatever tronxy shipd
If you're nifty with CAD you can adapt the parts to fit most frames obviously a frame similar to the tronxy will receive the new features faster and if you build your own you get to make sure its square and sturdy
*4000mms  incoming*
Sure but double the top speed and acell for a speedboat would be insane
They should have the torque
<@509772297289072653>. For pure speed is it possible to gear the motor from 1:1 to 2:1 so one motor spin is 2 belt spins
Yooo opened yt and vez's new vid dropped 12s ago
4 holes and a flare sheet
A simple plate that holds the rod holder down lower is ez
Looking good
yup
Oof
110k
Ah sorry, maze beat you by a second
Anyone feel like helping troubleshoot fluidd/mainsail
Or for the fun of it. Mix the two and test it out
You could wipe a thin layer of the white lithium over the rail and use the wd40 for bearings
Yup. Less flex. Cleaner setup, less overall parts and potentially lower cost but ymmv
Sup. If you're building on a ender 5 frame talk to maze. He's remodeled the vzbot to fit onto a e5
<@!558976020317732874>  heres your mod
Have a good time
imagine v0 got gud and thats what devins got
So printed lying down with extrusions going left to right and vice versa for a light pipe
So for a pla machine it could work
A trail behind the led following the nozzle would be sick, or a glass bed with high temp led underneath (if those exist)
Temps, toolhead, motor speeds on a bar chart or vibrations on a line/bar chart
Cheers
On the topic of rgb leds, if i use the neopixel output on my board for generic rgb led strips with a 12v r g and b pin, could i use a different 12v supply and use the rgb pins on the board o control color
Thats dope
Fair enough, then yeah avoid pla. Acetone smoothed abs goes cloudy so perhaps thats a good diffuser
With the leds stuck to the frame would it not be a heatsink
Any clear filament with a thin layer height  should be fine, or tissue paper
Perhaps a large diffuser and a bit of dimming would help
Ah. Unfortunate
Healthy
Sounds
3 hours sleep
I only got to bed at 1
Lol its 840 here
Ill add that when I ger out of bed
Good or bad
I prefer ptfe gas and a sprinkling of lead from my cheap nozzles
But only season after frying
Thats only medium rare I prefer a temp closer to 400. If you cook at 300 and fry later then its alright
Lighter. And cheap. Ill try pick some up for some gantry bits and compare weight. Any recommendations for seller
We should add his channel to the alerts

yup, just typeit into the config, lemme find the klipper docs on it
anywhere, just type it in
or another thing, cant remeber that kicks in above a set temp
you set a max delta and it tries to keep it around there
it would be a temp_fan
my enclosure is just 75mm thick insulation resting around all but one side of the printer and the front with a carboard door with hinges
reports temp and probably controls the vent fan
32 max is good for me up to 100 degrees and 235 on the nozzle with 95 on bed
And tpu for chemical resist although iirc pet would work too
Pla for ease and easy to change the finish with temp
Wait, thats not an answer
I still would have to figure out logistics and editing, but i need to decide on something to try first
Just for a first vid
If i were to start a youtube channel would a super cheap enclosure only using my tools on hand and recycled parts be interesting or a sound a lighting setup for my shed (fairly large but no insulation or ventilation) and other upgrades to make it livable be more interesting
Cool thanks
Ah cast aluminum plates, how are they made in short
Quick question. Cast aluminum. Is that straight up poured out alum thats machined
On the stepstick board, as in wether its in the chip or off chip
The stepstick carries the chip and other electrical bits
External mosfet refers to mosfets position on the chip
Ah well yeah. But he helped
And he designed the form 3, <:POGGERS:828643300352327700>
Ah yes, regular use to ensure quality
Well ive got his wire strippers and his toolboxes are stored in my room instead of the shed after they rusted and i had to fix them
Lol, mine is slowly expanding but most of my toolset is stolen off my dad
I was gonna get a second hand one for 20 bucks and then stupid brexit and the stupid tax laws killes that idea
<a:banned:852615477196881941>
On it
I have my max set to insanely high and a macro at the start of each print that sets it to something reasonable but if im in a pinch i can just turn it up
Yeah just use the slider
this still works though
I think i broke it <@!323961338412138497>
Added it
With how exclusive both commands are its not much spam but eh we can make a botspam channel
Anyways
Fine ill do it myself
Have fun
Gn, ive got school tmrw so im off to bed, mess around with the new mee6 bot (prefix is ! Or a /)
When we hit 500 members we can get server stats iirc
Look at the bottom of the channel list
Yeah i just added it for the fun of having a command, you can add more though
Hehe
Pc does not
Mobile and anything apple have those emojis built in
80% sure I saw that toolhead on thinguverse a few weeks ago but yeah UnIqUe
We do use steppers and we are corexy, i dont see why not
I see, this might reduce the contact between belt and pulley and the added bearings add drag, i would rather just move the motor further backwards or use a 1:1 gear ratio. But also what abertare said
Whats the reasoning for that over normal corexy
Loks more like textured injectiuon mold imo

I had a feeling you weren't done experimenting after Odrive. I have bigtreetech 2160 drivers coming that can take 60v but not suitable for motors below about 2.6a. I'll try these 5160HV's too. If you can get your hands on a OSM 17hs24-2104s they turn high RPM. Here's a video of that motor with TMC2130LA @ 36v moving 3kg
https://youtu.be/KWK_djAidQs
This is about 2600rpm. There is a possibility this motor wont be able to perform like this with a belt drive as the ball screw with 10mm lead is a 4:1 reduction over conventional belt gearing but maybe it will since I'm sure your mechanics weigh no were close to 3kg.
Theoretically over 1700mm/s
Lol got a motif a few hrs ago but only live now
Ah nice, the best kind
Fair enough
But we support knockoffs and carbon copys from aliexpress
Either way its a fair warning and i wouldnt wish legal trouble on anyone wanting free nitro
Like privacy.com
Also one time use credit cards exist
Nah its talking about people who used a fake credit card generator
Incase someone has done it i would rather they dont get into trouble
I think a cardboard cupboard around the boxes should help
Possibly, cardboards a good insulator and people warn against leaving printd in the sun although I have no first-hand experience
Also before i toss the board out, should i discharge the capacitors or will it be fine without
If i do it, which i wont
Ah, so do it with other people and do it in a safe environment
I just wanna see sparks or the arcs from the output, that last part rules it out tho
Sounds like i shouldnt do it, thanks for the advice
Also any safety precautions other than dont touch the outputs or is just a really bad idea to just completely avoid
<@!451709396280410132> i bought some LEDs and decided the psu from the flourescent bulbs was useless, i wanna try wire up all those capacitors (or just the really beefy one or some of the medium ones) and build a taser, was there anything else in that cicuit i would want to make said taser
Nah just some junk text and a interobang
Lmao, they were in voron too, didnt get banned tho, just kciked
Fairly certain they just found some top ten list and posted dumb shiz
Oh they were here, we had to ban tehm
Whats the vu mean
Ah good
Have you seen the diyperks video where he converts a monitor to a 'sun panel', I wanna do that but to light up my enclosure, color accuracy isnt much of a concern
Alrighty, what should I be paying for ~20m of leds the cheapest I found are 14 GBP
Quality isnt great as in cri or in lifespan or something else <@323961338412138497>
Is leds gonna being cheaper locally or from AliExpress?
Ill googles the component names you mentioned then prod them, if they're all broken or nearly as expensive as less then ill just use some LEDS
With the continuous mode
While its on I just poke the outputs and inputs of components until it stops beeping
How exactly do I rule those out?
This one does nothing at all. No flickering or slight power
Possibly. What would indicate that
<@!451709396280410132>  you had the most knowledge here, any reason the backlight wouldn't turn on with the wall, plug in and the backlight plugged in (fuse is all good I checked it)
I didnt leave it plugged in for too long tho
Wiring is fine as far as I can see since theres only one plug it fite
So I plugged in my monitor with just rhe backlight plugged in, ir should light up right
Well true. Wich is why free sync (iirc) works best at 2x the monitors refresh rate
Both mean the same thing but only in terms of video. When it comes to displays and video on the display it makes more sense to use hertz for monitor and fps for the video
Although a 75hz monitor will display 75 frames only 60 of them will be new frames on 60fps video
120fps video can be played on a 30hz monitor but it will appear to be 30fps and 30fps video can be displayed on a 120hz monitor and it will look like 30fps but with maybe less input lag or slightly smoother gameplay
That's not how it works. 60fps is how many frames are rendered or taken or sent. 60hz is how many times your screen refreshes and displays a new frame or the same frame
Sure thing
60fps*
And you get 2 boosts. So you could boost our server and a friends server
If we get 15 people to boost the server that would be pretty sick
Theres free nitro ob epic games
From the high speed or a change?
Thnaks, ill be trying the above tips
Also, quick question. If I get a HDMI to whatever port my ipad has can I use it for klipperscreen (its a ipad 2, not air or pro just the og ipad 2) and if not can I force it to power on with the printer and load into mainsail
1 person away from 300 memebrs
Damn, that's before any wear, right?
and that maths is just the time until any wear shows up, at all
yeah we good for hundreds of thousand of hours
yeah 1021 hours, not terrible but not great. and thats worst case in a heavy load environment with presumably no grease
well ill say 20m for maths sake
for you, just as a example
For my maths, humor me, on average 30m?
a average cube takes roughly how long?
Actual weight pulls on the rails and while belts could partially suspend the gantry it wouldn't fully. Plus the fact that corexy is balanced in a magical world of perfection, IRL theres imbalance on the belt tension and unequal forces so technically yes, but no.
and considering theres 4 sides and 3 walls with 136 layers you could print ~3063.7254902 cubes before seeing a single bit of wear and thats assuming lots of load and probably a medium amount of lube in a demanding environment
100,000,000mm is hard to visualize but one cali cube's side is 20mm so you could print 5,000,000 sides of a cube before seeing any wear
100km is 100,000m or 10,000,000cm or 100,000,000mm. Those are astronomically high and with barely any weight it could last even longer
I could speculate that the spec sheet is referring to well built linear rails that have better tolerances and we use bad rails and block with terrible tolerance, but I'm no pro
same here
Wouldn't it depend on how well built the block is, I'm fairly certain a high preload block wouldn't be affected, but my dodgy wobbly carriage would hang on one set of balls?
sorry for the delayed reply, if you wanna send a .stl/obj/3mf i can whack out a print and test or we can wait if you wanna keep the files private, idm either way
i can just cut off the spacer and most of the fitted holes and just leave the relevant part intact
are you able to print now, if not im home and can slice it up to print
in terma of getting it in the hole it looks like theres a cut out for getting it in
theyre m3, with the cap heads being roughly 4~5mm iirc so you could just open that hole up a little, but assuming its designed right they would sit flush or be out of the way
Perhaps some c.f. sheets cut to size would help
nothing impossible but something cool and re usable
yup, theres nothing too difficult about that part, but we gotta think of something no opne in this server can build, like RAC can make his hotend but i cant so we gotta make mellow be like rac and produce something thats completely out of reach for majority users
custom hotend with either a nova mosquito mix up or knockoff magnum+ or like iirc racs hotend design with direct filament contact, custom motors for low inductance, high temp cf tube with holes for nuts embeded into the mold
Haha. Perosnally love the channel all original and a very straight to the point all info presentation with no run time padding
but his business practices are a wee bit fishy but i couldnt care less tbh
yeah i love teaching tech since he condenses other content into short bite size videos with diagrams and made a tuning website
now it may just be a a big conspiracy buuut
right after someone else makes a vid he posts
yeh he apparently steals content, his videos are very convenient ngl
he and teaching tech are both kinda dingus's
if its any good ill move it to superlight and pin it, just lmk
the guys a ass but the video might be good (hevent had time to see)
new vid
also can yo__ link the vid__
also thats one reaaaaly long belt
h bot comes out of alignment with belt tension iirc
ah cool
isnt telegram ios only
no but is this savings or profits
can i ask where this money came from  '$5000+'
fair enough, i appreciate the time and for clearing up some queries i had
so you loose money on sales, thats a silly business idea
this convcersation woulda been a lot shorter had you said that in the begining, but its nice to know it was fully tested, also can the screws bottom out or can those threads be stripped if over torqued
and i have asked trianglelabs on many ocassions wether certain ideas were good and if they would really hold up, ive ahd a few responses and most of them explained the design choice and said it was a toss up between quality and price and ultimtely price was chosen, so while it will be worse it wasnt a substantial or justifiable amount compared to the prce change
i never said you were unlikable, your blunt and to the point, i value that in a seller
when i first asled you, you said it was tested in a different material with threaded holes and that you had confidence
hahahah i wish
well thats the thing, you said it SHOULD last and when i hear that from the guy designing it i start doubting its quality, i cam here searching reassurance that the screw had been cycled over and over and no degredation was found
you designed it and produce it (partially) so i trust you on your product more than a user who doesnt have hundreds of hours designing and testing it
also i find it insulting that im excluded from asking questions about a product just because i dont have enough money to afford it
well i cant afford it first of all but i would love to reccomend it to people who can but i cant do that if i dont know its a quality product
is this available to someone who hasnt purchased, i just wanna take a look around
and final point, a sla with pre printed holes will not perform the same as threaded metal, same as how a rolled ballscrew is very different to a ground ballscrew same as how a threaded hole is different to a hole with a screw forced into it (also will these be hardened self tapping screws or just standard size screws)
final 2 questions, what else is invlolved (just a tl:dr)
proce?
so, the hotend has nothing to do with cnc
the rigourous QC and thousands of hours and people working in r and d with a solid front end design team that brings together a well made product that ca be mass produced
but what makes yours (other than design) the good product of china
i can agree with that, im no pro at any of this
and final point, a sla with pre printed holes will not perform the same as threaded metal, same as how a rolled ballscrew is very different to a ground ballscrew
wich brings me to my next point, some people are concerned that these hotends are produced in chine and repackaged by you in [insert home country], which is worrying considering this product claims better tolerances than other hotends, but those other hotend are also produced in china
new nova hotend
1 year isnt indefinite
but remain open for the every day hobbyist, right?
but, no offense, this isnt yet a mainstream product, the volcano is notorious for snapping but it doesant happen all too often, but because of the masses of users it appears to be a common issue
but fans dont last forever, so in high temperature environments or something goes wrong electrically and i replace the fan i decrease my product life time which is concerning
if i buy your product and assume its well cared for it should last indefinetly
but this product is meant to be long lasting right
thats reassuring
true but people dont normally do a lot of things but products still have to be up to the task incase it happens
the fan holes
thats good to hear
so first question, how will the threaded metal hold up to multiple screw cycles
ah  but the flatter proofile does mean more travel if you flatten out the carriage
<@!825681531448197131>  i see your planning on threading the metal for the new heatsink (wich looks dope btw, much better than a cylinder) and just wanted to ask a couple questions and debunk/verify a few rumours
No prob
Or minimum extrusion rate
Minimum time
all good, did a 5mb file in nder a second
Yikes
Lemme check in a sec
Whereas a full diy is a big lump sum (smaller overall though]
Ive enjoyed what ive done and the price for upgrades can br spread out quite well
I dont regret buying a printer to mod but I'm now looking at a new psu and bed and soon the printer will be fully custom
If yoy have a printer already then no
Heres my 2 cents
Sad to see you leave but what a way to go out
ive already got the dry ptfe and now need some contact cleaner
the pricing is identical and description is similar
is there a way to test if the dry ptfe lube is the same as contact cleaner from wd40
Oh good ill pick some up and try find some foam while I'm at it
and the old man you gave it to me said i can take anything from his skip wich means i can take the tiles too, so hows tiles on the edge with insulation glued to the tile or maybe just tiles on the base to sit on
and its freeeeeeee
its roughly 3.5m tall maybe more
<@451709396280410132>. Full size bbq for scale
Want a side profile?
Lol its just a severed chunk I tried burning
Also does anyone know of a suuper barbones nf crazy mount that's well balanced (preferably voron style corexy until ok upgrade to vzbot)
Just charged my phone ill send you a photo of the insulation <@451709396280410132>
Ill @you when
No air pockets, on a walk so I'll get a pic after
<@451709396280410132>
Should I use it
Right well the insulation charred and shrunk away
Dang ours are more like this
Oh really, might snag a few then
I wish I went diving tho
No not all, just saying I just peek into the bome on my way
Nah my school route (barely a mile) has 10 or more 'skips' or dumpsters
Anyway brb
As you can tell by the fact I'm taking all this from bins and dumpsters, Rockwool is too much money
Lmao they'll only see 50 or so assuming I mostly print pla and occasionally asa
I should do this outside right, I doubt the fumes are all too friendly
I'm 60% sure its 100% this (
Lemme check
And if I need it theres some thick tiles
And some particle board (mdf] in a bin too (enough for a box)
There's some aluminum laminated hard yellow foam insulation in my neighbours bin (tons of large flat panels that are quite thicc) and possibly some glass panels ill make into a curved roof or just a normal roof
If it doesnt make sense I can draw one up
Would a large box with glass panel and external electronics box or a insulation panels around the sides and a false bottom (electronics mounted there) and a lid that keeps the extruder (Bowden for now but soon to change) and x y outside (so everything that needs to stay cool is isolated, electronics will have a big fan over them)
For a enclosure
If you use 0.12 layer height and line width of 0.36 then you top out at 367 for a volumetric flow of 15.8
it can do 147mm/s at .25 so most probably, i can go calculate the top speed at .3 with my current max flow later, but most probably yes
i just need higher flow tbh and im using a phat 40x40 fan overvolted so cooling shouldnt be an issue
i dont mind the condition, i can fix it up (assuming worse condition=lower price)
you wanna sell it for cheap (ill pay shipping and all that)
and youre in germany?
if you constantly max out volumetric flow then layer height wont matter so i just use the lowest layers i can with the top speed of my printer
at 0.12 you can get up to 367mm/s
do you still have the clone
fair enough then i persoannly wouldnt want anything not rigid mounted
ive never had a clog and im on a half clone half genuine microswiss
i think its luck of the draw and using a good fan
my clone doesnt
YEs
dont settle for anything not rigid mounted
just for 30m for a test
hm, are you able to hold one temporarily
try a bigger fan, the knockoffs dont work like the original on small fans
and is it enclosed
and what heatsink cooling
what do you currently have
thomas sanladerer has a good review of it
Ah, dry silicone
So I got a electric screwdriver and its really loud, I opened it up and its got a gearbox inside, is it worth me spraying some dry ptfe or smearing some white lithium grease in there or is the noise unavoidable
<@202189639593754624>. I would assume for identical cost and packaging and end effect that they're identical but ill stick with the tried and true one then
im gonna go for the contact cleaner just incase its more suitable for electronics and less corrosive somehow
phew, they have identical pricing and similar packaging and color schemes and both do the same thinng (thin layer of ptfe)
these are identical,right?
what is it?
Awwwwwww
Phew
I thoufht you meant straight up wd40
Ah good
Nice. Is that normal wd40 or a grease
ah cool
perhaps time for a oldham coupled brass nut
isnt that bed, you want it to move around at the top instead of the platform
is the leadscrew and stepper shaft sufficiently spaced
and do you have a flex shaft
bad leadscrew?
unlucky my corexy somehow prints flawlessly and i didnt even calibrate esteps or flow or really anything other than speed
well moving the y need all the idlers iirc  so it sounds like its the y carriage
also it sounds like maaaybe a rail if not your gonna have a hell of a time finding it
what part did you use
oh i HATE that noise, the screeching whining modulating screeches of petg with screw is painful
also is it only on one axis that it squeaks
if its a idler on a screw i would try lubing the inside of the idler that contacts the screw
i would guess badly lubed z, weird extruder or a pulley, if its a pulley's bearing then your gonna need to bust it open or find a way to grease it
uh oh
if its got coolign it cant be that bad
POGGERS
the large gears and aio extruder with the heatsink allong the side
Just re assembled to clean out filament dust from flow rate tests and tighten the grub screw, ill check the Bowden tho
Ive had previously flawless results
Ive started a print at really low speeds and ill see how it looks
So I can't get it on vid but it the lever moves up and down and my Bowden tube moves quite a bit at the extruder and it barely got any grip
Lemme video this
I think my bmg is broken
You know it was (not officially iirc)
So a lgx knockoff could say its h2 inspired
Biqu h2 isnt iirc
Press x to doubt
Especially if I xan actually aford the damn thing
Lol he knows. I was saying I like his quality but I can live with sonething a little worse with similar quality
I Cnt wait for a nova and lgx clone
Heatbreak is gonna get toasty butbthe heatsink should be cold
But that pid isn't
This is a absolute win
And part cooler to only cool the parts
That's good, you want the heatsink to be completely isolated from the block
ah should be fine
dope, hows it looking
if you just wanna send a link i can send the full message again later
yeah you can send a message link but those look kinda ugly so i just downloaded and re uploaded the stl
cheers
who made it
added <#845353557384495135>
faster than yt
and thanks for the notif
poggers
like cupping your ear, that noise was always there but now your amplifying it
yeah it just needs to remove any dead space
ah good
uk here
ah, ive only repaired not built, that expanding foam though you would have to be carful about adding just enough
yeah you just squeeze it out with a applicator gun, i think our windows are very different
do you mean caulk (pronouced:cock) or weather stripping
to be serious tho, any old foam would fix that
just fill it with sand to dampen noise/s
Hello there
psh tinkercad for life
Yeah I know but it only uses 2 or so gb
It was jinxed
And a igpu
Its a 3rd gen i7 with 4gb of 1600mhz ram
Tbf
I had chrome open and that's it
Nope just windows stopped
Had to pull the plug
Um uh oh
I dont see why not. Why not make it a suspended mass dampener while your at it
Same as you would tune pwm gradient for stealthchop you tune whatever it is on spreadcycle
not that i understand that sheet
spreadcycle, the tmc data sheet goes over it
i hope he covers tuning tmc stepper drivers for spreadcycle
brim
Duct it and easy dubs
Looks pretty sick
nvm then
oop, thought it was all together for 24
Hm. Cheaper than a delta fan, interetsing
Whereas these are just smooth rotation
Or steppers move in steps wich make tiny ripples or shakes and that really adds up
Yup
f
all good now
lol
might want a europe on the role selection, unless we dont have any europeqan sellers
how do i get rid of this
Yeah it looks too fragile
Ive got at most 125k on long straights but only up to 300mm/s
Hv 5160
So you might have 2 sets overlapping or none
I wonder if more motors would fix it since they wouldnt be on the same 'microstep'
4wd odrive would be awsome
also in annex
on what axis and, photo?
Damn thats gonna be a sweet build. Good luck
and if it arriuves you get a nice sparw
and buy from a more reputable seller
well if its already in transit try get a refund or open a dispute since i dont thiunk its arrivimg
thank you
yup that
the 90 degree bracket
<@!323961338412138497>  i cant run solidworks or fusion so no beuno to export it
alrihgt, its opening now
no matter what i select
<@!323961338412138497>  when i select something to download it downloads the same part
it worked, thank you
im on a potato pc
fusion360 crashes when i try open
i cant open the step in fusion
does anyone have the stl for the brackets vez uses on the 90 corners
how come, he seemed alright
yeah definitely, but once we get a 4wd vez bot the k3 is gonna get beat
oh no, that epoxy isw gonna wear down and release deadly carbon fiber dust
is it vslot
i think im looking at the wrong part of the spreadsheet, but that clay printer (duno what its special sauce is, especially since its available for 300 gbp) is corexy, like this printer and the hevort
fairly certain his is faster than 10m
have you not seen nitrams benchys or even miragec's
what size are they
possibly
I gotta get my ptfe grease tho
Im just gonna bust open my cheap idlers and if its better ill do it to these bearings
And comment on the 'weight' caused by idlers
I might bust open a few of my idlers when I get flanged bearings and test if I can go faster with the dry lubed idlers
You're better off doinf corexy or delta for speed
But th3 short belts are only for the print quality
And a 4wd on corexy only requires one splitter and 2 more motors
I do like it but that weight is awful. A delta or 4wd for corexy imo is besr
or stronger
i imagine it gets lighter
does that work on any part
would be super dope
a skip up my road had a ton of insulation and a single glaze window+frame, would have been easy enough to convert into a enclosure but i couldnt take it with me
nah, i wonder if rigid moutning to a lack table with brackets would be better
well its a foundation wall so im not too worried
well my frame is quite stiff, im getting some new brackets in the mail soon tho
i wonder if wall mounting the thing with 4 points is better than what cnc kitchen did
Nice
ah just named vzbot, since ya know vez/vezbot/vez3d
Whos vzbot
Lucky, ive got no shops near me with anything useful, not even a hardware store
Spherical?
Ceramic?
thank you
i gotta go fast
so 2.8 is good and anything less is great
whats a good inductance and is the inductance the thing that adds resistance the faster you move the rotor
fair enough, im gonna use ptfe and ceramic at the same time
but yeah make sure it says dry, also the wd40 has a small bit of mineral oil so if you use that on the rail and then ipa to clean the bearings you'll be fine
amazon lets you return immediately wich is nice
or 400ml at 4.50 from a in person shop
but only use the dry on the actual bearings and the oil on everything else
would some oil then a wipe down thrn a dry lube be best since it gets corrosion free from the oil but benefits of dry lube
true but my build needs to be speed on a budget, im getting a 3rd printer for nice prints
and 4x4.4kg of torque would be 17.6kg of torque
ohhhhh, that sound much better, i dont mind a lack of resolution i just want torque
yeh im on a budget so most of these are coming next year or peice by peice
yep same, my next upgrade will be ceramic bearings and dry ptfe and 5160's with awd and 2a steppers
you could buy ptfe powder and add some light mineral oil
daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn
could be dry
psh why wait 1 or 2 days when you could buy from aliexpress and build up anticipation as you count down the 100 days it takes to arrive
Also check out ceramic bearings if your steel ones ever break
Trust me. Talk more and for longer but never pad your videos with junk. Only have content. If what youe saying is meaningless then don't say it
hey vez have you tried ceramic bearings for higher strength and less friction
i think i could get a bot that does it automatically
since a voron with your z axis is still a voron it wouldnt make sense for it to have a serial, but a ender 5 with everything stock other than the corexy motion its pretty much still a vzbot
carriage can be different, same for z axis
i think its the mtion system that matters most, so motor mount and front and x idlers
and profesional
not needed but very very very cool
<@!509772297289072653> the new video is really good
dang lucky
please do
Yeah I was planning on hevacs but this should fit my printer better so I'm waiting for his design
Truw
Lol
Hey, congrats on admin
hello
oh? thats neat i was under the impression it wouldnt fit at all
That knockoff version probably won't even fit properly which is a shame
Vez tried to take down one of the listing but it's like a hydro. More and more pop up
I think the current idea is to get one to rac for preliminary testing and before release the whole team gets one but I'm not 100%
But the rest of the team will get one fairly soon for finalizing
Only vez has one in hand rn
Still early alpha
faster? yeah theyre lighter. better prints? probably not noticeably
Does it have a sock or any insulation
perhaps the weird recurring lines on my prints are from the crappy ¬£0.50 pulleys i bought
didnt realize bad pulley could be that bad
looks pretty warm
just wiggle the belts and listen to the bearings. press your ear against them to hear it a little better if you can
i would check juuust in case
perhaps try see if its an idler
no belts but everything else in place?
is it easy to wip off the toolhead and have just the carriage
same noise you get with printing
hold it with one finger with the leats amount of pressure you can
at the same speed you print at with noise, move the rail carriage
just to ask but does the rail make noise when run by hand with motors or belt connected
budget cuts really hit those belts hard huh
vzbot motion/gantry?
above 60c they soften
but cf is more light and less high temp
alu is high temp and fairly light
For speed, thin machine oil or dry ptfe
welp that seems pretty indisputable to me
just out of interest whats wrong with ali?
yup, withiut any trademark best we can do is say please
nothing vez can do about it
ah cool
if it isnt mellow, dont buy
nopr
Mgn7 and mgn5 are alright but it gets a little iffy if you don't use a lightweight tool head
The biggest issue is the rail itself being funky (if it's a really really cheap rail)
Yup
And parts are fully custom designed by the rest of the mod team (I don't do the design stuff)
Parts of it are modded for compatibility
Yeah that's mostly right
do you have an image or illustration you can share to help explain
maybe center of the two blocks but croxy is annex territory, ask there
you want t to be centered inside the linear block afaik
timezones
looooool
yup
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo daaaaaaaaaaaaaamn, i gota tune up my printer
drippy shoes
Not half way or most of the way
No, extreme as in far side
If one extreme you can't get both sides to touch it may be unsqaure
That's racking
At the other end y is closer than x
If at one exterme of the axis x is closer than y
<@557220161346600971>
hm
well thatds the point, get rid of racking
mayaswell fully tighten
if they are rasther fully install them
can you check them?
are thy 90 degree
which corner brakcetz
try move it using just one finding in the middle, see if it sticks anywhere
hm, does it rack during movement
where are you holding the gantry when you move it
Would that cause the racking
Is the frame istelf square
damn sexy
yay
Mounting would be wacky thk
Would a triangle not be the best for every strength
üò±
OH PHEW
for mounting?
im personally holding my breath for the lgx lite flow rate
havent seen much on that extruder
nice regular mounting holes will make modularity/upgradeability with future hotends nice
would you not drill straight through the two
ah cool i finally figured out how people use cnc machines and all the flipping stuff üòÉ
would you not just flip it once and use a drill press for 4 holes total
bottom left of the carriage youll see it
theres a screw
''Some very high-end commercial Pick-And-Place Deltas use four arms to enhance speed and precision.''
so yes
i beleive theres a square delta
it remends me of a daddy long leg spider
those better not be steel core tho
in all seriousness though that looks so cool
now start a homing sequence
this, ladies and gentlmen, is how to not run the printer
i have stainless steel ones (and copper or brass ones i think)
I love the alum back panel
Damn that looks amazing
but thats all just testament to how good a photographer vez is
yeah its the bokeh, near perfect detailing and just how shiny and crisp everything eis
you could probably use any old resin polish or a photo with a bright light and a sharp angle to the tube would look quite shiny
phew, i know its all made in china regardless but it still brings negativity saying chinese somehting, nice to hear theyre good quality
are they any good, hows machining/however they're made
damn that is pretty
maze told me every step of the way it was stupid and i thought it would be fine but yeah nah i had funky first layers and weird spots of high resistance and my lin rails didnt go all the way acros from one gantry to another so it wasnt all too sturdy
i tried it and it wasnt at all worth it
i wouldnt reccomend it
if all else is equal then i prefer the top one
black is cf and red is m3/5 standoffs
brb
lemme draw it
yes but repeatimg along the beam
also would 2 flat bars with spacers be better, with a top down view looking like ---> l-l
like afterburner /s
ah theres a lot of un clear terms in 3d printing so sometimes it requires some extra info or interpreatation
wich was fixed with square cf tube
i think he means vibrating and bendinf the round cf tubes
ah you should probably add those first, when my x is loose it binds like hell
im no rpo, but that sounds like some misalignment somewhere maye, does it happen with looser screws
there might be a step in machining which stops them moving one way but not the other
try hold it in the middle and move but also are the blocks at all damaged inside
i dont get any when my extrusios are bolted together
nearly any
and all screws tightened and rails are aligned
photo of progress? and are the rails mounted to the printer <@!795765716925546546>
Hey congrats man, youve nearly acheived every hobbyists dream
Like the taller bearings
Ohh, wider belts
Do you mean those idlers have smaller bearings so the larger flange bearings are better
Oh damn, thats awsome <@!798489761970782229>. ill buy it and convert to vzbot
Thats where i got mine, says 2gt powergrip
Also trianglelabs sells genuine gates
For sure, just if you arent sure if its one or the other get gt2 idlers
Iirc gt2 only works with gt2 but 2gt works on both
For larger sizes (especially corexy) ive heard the long 6mm belts are like long 8mm rods and turn to spaget
sure
someones gotta be looking to offload leftovers
no problem
discords
include location and how much filament
theyve all got good user markets
voron
annex
hevort
want to buy
I would make a wtb post for second hand filament
Damn, thats awesome
Do you mean it can deliver more force as a concept but its stepper cant
Or just v6 and whatever extruder
Also when you say v6 do you mean v6+lgx?
Yes. Smaller moment of thingymbob wich means any wiggle wont be amplified
And easy to do ac bed with
I would get the pro, its not too much more expensive
Ik but this way is cleaner if  you run the whole system 48v
Its what im using and its been nothing but a dream, other than the fact i needed a second psu
Yup
All skr pro
The skr pro can be modded for up to 100v iirc
Cross gantry does seem best, but the way annex does it is best
Nah for me, i wanna build a all out printer and donate my current one to my school to replcae their dogshit crap ass printer
Guess its time to get a job and a savings account
External cooling?
True. But it will work even temporarily. Uneven tension does it to alum so why not cf
Try using uneven belt tension to pull it into shape
Dang that looks good
noo, such a waste of metal
Yup
Yeah they're great tiny computers, a docking station and monitor and it become a great cpmputer
Lolol affordable ipads. Imagine
I cant even Sound them out without bad spelling
Heh
The 'if you sound it out phonetically its the same thing" type English is best
Is think vise and vice are pretty much the same thing
What you said
Fair enough
This allows for upwards facing steppers and put the strain on a bracket instead od the stepper. While this is more effort its useful for certain cases
Meanie
Oi
Lol
Ah my bad
Why not use a vice like thingie that pushes on the motor and have slots on the screw holes and just use the vice to adjust tension
Don't be silly, they break when the block is on (its too heavy duh)
I think 6 is a good average
Sure can
Would you mind posting into community mods so I can pin it
nice, almost worth remixing the vzbot
lol, pretty humble for one of the cheapest and fastest corexys in the speedboat race
just added some of the lightest extruders in there
probably
getv well soon and try not to break your roof with a chain hoist
Dann lucky, that saves quite a bit of weight with just under a fifth of the total weight
allow my to just pull my sandblaster out my ass and get sand blasting
duh
psh, just get  a handsaw and file and diy it
Nice
When I get home
Ill get mine later <@257878979694821380>
Hm
Quick fyi cf is only 7 bucks shipped to the UK (might be more wherever you are)
i think one had a gash in the bottom
'they were in a ditch, i swear!'
all run smoothly for my application and dont give any weird artifacts
oiled the best and drilled out the worst and re assembled and greased and greased the loose one
mine were ¬£3 and i had one perfect one awfula dn one slighlty too loose
if they arent the best just slap some thicker grease in there
It would be super stiff and the sheet metal if done right would be super light
But what if you use sheet metal and linear rails all welded together with the x axis and a welded together frame
Well. Stupid idea and I cant do it (no metal parts
<@265629116106145793>. can you weld?
just machine more room duh, carve out the vice
Holy moly it looks beautiful
Looking good
why dont we use a flat plane and cut to shape and screw the rail to that like this gantry
not screws, pipes
theyre from arrows i beleive
But anyone experienced with c.f. will know that if you separate or cut the fibers it gets pretty weak
In abs I doubt it, you only need 2-6 and they could be very small since the epoxy will secure them
Any cuts into the bar remove strength
Printed standoffs that wrap around the bar and get epoxied on and have holes for heat set inserts
e.g 2gt belts work with gt2 idlers whereas gt2 belts wont work well on 2gt idlers
2gt ik has less deep teeth but apart from that i think theyre identical
or even gt3
also qq:  hows 2gt better than gt2?
not steel, steel belts are not designed for long term use on small diameter pulleys, although many people have used them for ages. but on the other hand some people have had theres just rip up immediately
examples near me
check ebay
what with
ah, well other than size and inability to be accurate at edges its the best beginner printer for people printing anything round, tall or fast
cm?
ya your right then
welp, never mind
only since the creality is the cheapest option wheres flsun is more midrange
yeah i guess a good delta will always run circles around a corexy and cartesian
ah
how come?
oopsie, missed one
if you havent already, dm me and ill send it over
Ah cool
Could you send me your config?
yup, imo its worthless, ive also seen it use don petg to stop sticking
for stringing usually
I assume pin melts, not sure what temp
It might, im not sure
If it doesnt already exist some insider knowledge from another discord tells me it will
Whatcha gonna reuse the rods for
But lever
Tbf, they could be very expensive leadscrews
Damn, sexy
Yep, i would just need some spacers since i already have idlers, maybe new belts and the raild dhould suffice (300mm)
You could reuse all the parts tho
You would need to rill and tap holes if you want to just rotate it, so the base of the z will need to be modified
Ah i havent converted to vzbot just yet
Thats at the bottom of the printer at the top you just put a no go zone around the smooth rods
Yup, i didnt change a single bit of it
I use it. Its not bad but its not great either
Yeah it was second hand, the z was the new one but hotend the old style and the belts were replaced but the frame assembly the old style and the board the old style but the new psu so it must have been refurbished
Yup, got it a while back for 30 bucks
So i coul build the vzbot directly onto my frame with no changes if i rotat it
The ratrig printer
Ah cool
Never seen that board before, what's it called
Hehe, that's gonna be an awesome design
I saw some guy using them on Reddit
Are you using those ball joint tripod stands?
yeah that would be a massive let down to start a print and have it crawl and 5mm/s, although leadscrews can be fairly snappy, i saw a e3 doing 80 on the z
for sure, the cheap ones are doodoo but can be fixed with wobble wings and other upgrades, its really just a toss up of whats easiest to get and rn thats a leadscrew
the brass nut wont wear out and backlash is reduced also sturdier, other than that theyre quite well matched#
perhaps theirs isnt properly lubed or they have a bad brass nut
on heaters, when you increase the voltage doesnt it massively increase the heat output
That's pretty professional looking
woukdnt the brass nut being mounted on a oldham coupler to allow it to move x and y but not rotatonally force the bed to hold still and stop z banding
Fuzzy skin messes with dimensions quite a bit so I think its more a blue cf filament
having it line up properly might be a pain but you could drill it yourself
drilling yourself isnt too hard tho
yup, circulates air so as the bed drops it doesnt hit cold air at the bottom of the enclosure
Since heat rises but it probably isn't a huge difference
If it's too keep the chamber cooled then the top makes more sense
Or keeping below a certain level
Depends. Is that fan for maintaining the temp
Snip it then add a quick connect at the severed end
Beautiful
thats the kinda thing you say about my management, where you see a few cables routed alrightish but just out of site is the biggest health hazard in my house
Honestly if I was in the eu I would just hire maze to do my cable management
i wonder if using a tpu print would show a bigger differnce
damn, thats impressive, might be worth trying for the printed gantry bits and bobs
Thermal runaway=melty metal
<@!173827530929733632>
i thought you would have 4 sides and 4 sheets
oh you mean have it do a spiral
no no, i meant like a cloth snipped into rectangular sheets
well some hydrodipping or just a paint will fix that
ah, makes sense, so you would glue strips of cf sheets to a box with a insert and fill it with resin and have all your mounting hardware inserted before inception
or is it for ABS
i assume the heated chamber improves flow which is why we want it for speed
you could also buy a 2010 extrusion
stay sub 45
and the two bigger ones are the seeds of a hevacs style cooling system
i beleive the small one is circulation
It doesn't have to be old since any phone would work but if you mess it up while rooting it then you have a brick
old android phone
UART (smart features are controllable via firmware)
interpolation
stealthchop and spreadcycle
has sensorless homing
tmc2209 do 29v maximum and can run pretty well with just  heatsink
any nozzle, just sandwhich it in
escpecially since all you need it to glue a acceleromter onto a flat plate and hold that plate between the nozzle and block
either way theres a small difference so it probaly wont matter but doing it right if its same effort is preferable
oops
WELL THERE IS MUCH MORE MOVEMT AT THE NOZZLE THAN AT THE LINEAR RAIL
Most accurate, it's where all the vibrations go into the print
<@!485803444758773760> a niozzle mount is best
<:soon:906671622612742185>
Depends what voltage you want and how much IO you need
or adding a shortcut to the page masquerading as a app on android works nicely
i can endorse this 100%
so 4 steppers at max 2A probably 1.5A at 48v
skr2 pre-fix would fry drivers without any warning
oh god, when the product itself doesnt know its pinout youve got issues
cough skr-2 cough
8 drivers alone cost ~98, and a board alone cost 30 but together its 103, so 24 cheaper to buy all together
hm
true, just mentioning it as extra info, it makes sense why its that much
im waiting for all the 'my btt pro board exploded' vids
*with drivers is over 100
You can keep the same connector iirc just dont use the dodgy board ports
Also, can you direct wire steppers to the step stick and cut out the board as a middle man
Yeah i got nothing other than checking the chip and stick for damage
Also hae you tried disabling stealthchop for the fun of it
<@!759044926578229249> any clue?
And buzz_stepper stepper_x/ buzz_stepper stepper_y does the same motors
Hm, and the pins arent the same pin
Like how one plug is meant for dual z in paralel
Is the x and y otors plugged inot the driver with the 2 parraelel slots
Also a small peice of sticky tape on the pins, preferabblyt kapton or just included in box as a peace of mind
And it goes on the vm line afaik
Firmware wise, nada
It goes on the v in line as close to the driver iirc
^
You can also do like maze and add a plug (which fits perfectly) for more security on the connection
But for running 2 motors at high voltage this seems best
Some new boards will ship with 48v capability baked in so thats the best
Maybe
Well kinda
Yeah
Just search your board/printer and 'klipper docs'
It will be on the default docs tho
Run_current: 0.5 (for me)
I think it's
Klipper
Yup
5160 only do Spi iirc so use that. I default to using uart when its available as that's all ive used so far
He just inverted the power pins
Spi uart or standalone are communication (I think) protocol or systems
Rotated 90 bdegrees makes it tronxy
Yup
Hehe
Dunno why theyre in use but thats what they do
Those are terminal blocks, instead of soldering wires you can connect them with one of those
Dont forget ur surroundings
I suppose that's good enough for nearly every printer though
Darn
Holy carp. This looks dope. Just wish it were stepsricks but eh if its 48v capable I'm happy
Ah true, just if you run full 48v its nice
True, but a drv8825 will work there too, you could also do some janky solderig and connect the main in to the ports with 2209 and then the rest 48v
Saw someone with some wires and a bank of caps next to the board
Underneath the board
You do need to desolder another thing but otherwise its fine
Yup, second input for power
Change the caps under the stepsticks to 100v versions and youll have a 48v compatible board
Ive done that for some extra fans and thermistors and potentially steppers with a melzi board
I will warn against buy cheap and get better later, stuff adds up and its a pain to retune. But it makes sense if you buy parts that you know you can reuse
Most probably, assuming io is sufficient the 2209 are a great choice, im not sure if theyre wired in uart tho (for the smart features like sensorless homing)
Thanks for the help
Ah well
And just need a use for them
Ive got 5 left over
Is there any benefit to using a tl smoother to smooth out power to my pi or boards
Fair enough
Considerably for you is very different for me, how much per device is it (roughly)
Cable ties: tick duct tape: tick hot glue: to be determined
Its not fully finished but it will have a temp sensor inside
Its badly cut insulation with electronics inside and one side isnt insulated and ots just sitting on a insulation block and the lid isnt cut to size and walls are just held together with hope
Ill get a pic of it when I get back
Oh its worse
Oh if this is a mess then you do not want to see my stop gap enclosure
Flow wouldnt hurt especially if you use usb power
Just a heatsink has been fine with me and a steady 43 degrees under load
Nice
But cable raceway sounds right
Profesional idea : no clue
No worries maze I got this in the bag
That's my expertise
Electrical wiring
Oh yeah DIN is best if you want to change stuff out often or like the clean open look
Also theres no standard connectors or design and no one I've seen has documented a build like this
Well then the box offers better cooling and much cleaner look and quick disconnects look pretty clean just have enough shrink wrap for each solder joint and cable wrap if you want it
A custom case requires very specific cad and good design skills
Din are more open and standard and easy to design around
Nope. Although consider a separate box with quick connect connectors and cooling. Both have pros and cons and it really depends on wether you plan on changing hardware more often than not
Dope
So it would have given wrong temps but no damage
Nice
You might get thermal runaway though
So it cant do too much damage to plug it in
It how I learnt to use a multi meter
Or just do what I do and use a melzi board to test things on
So plugging it in cant really do that much harm
But that thernistor just uses different materials its fundamentally the same thing right
Fair enough
Or just see what the cfg says about it
Plug it I guess and if it doesnt show anything yank it out
Not In all cases but I think you can get external boards then output to thernistor ports
Well I did the mainboard+pi
Cool
Or I  can stack mainboard power and pi
<@451709396280410132>. My bed should be staying at relatively low temps until I get my new psu (40v for my steppers and for my pi with a step down) so is it okay to just leave the bed and pi stacjed
So stack second board, pi and stepper
<@451709396280410132>
Or should I do bed and pi
Can I stack a secondary board (thernistors only) and a pi and stepper power
dope, ill be stacking my pi and stepper supply then, i think the pi is low power enough for the psu to do both
my psu has run out of ports for power, i would need one more slot for the steppers
does the skr pro provide power to the steppers without the extra input
cheers
Will my bed or motors draw more power
If its a small bump then you may lose a small amount of time but watch it carefully and when it fails just purchase a new one
same, i think my melzi was turned on while sitting on sheet metal and it smoked once and it was.....functional
oh noo
Do you have a Multimeter?
How
Mine was 'dead' but I had something pluggee in wrong and it worked when I unplugged it
Welp. Nevermind
You could have shorted something
Alrigjt so unplug those and try power it on
What did you change
and 3 day shipping
yup
yup, heres the link 
I found a set for 10 bucks with the clamp thingy and the actual connectors, it seems good enough
Its bad tho
Awful
That's not
layer adhesion and bed adhesion is gonna take a l
yup
yep, you can go faster since the torque dropoff is lessened at hogh rpm
both
and mine cost ¬£26
youll have to get a new psu and desolder and resolder some new caps into the board
if you dont mind a bit of diy and need a new board the skr pro isnt too bad, its got a separate input for bed power and power for the steppers
but its expensive so you can always trial it with vezs idea
well if you wanna spend lots of money, a skr pro with a 48v psu and wire in new capacitors you have a cleaner setup
starting to regret going for the pro, although pro allows me to run a higher voltage for steppers and a separate psu for the bed
not sure, you would have to ask
ah, ill adjust it to 5.2 then
i have stepdown rated for 5A
is it meant to be 5v or 5.2v
lol, mine caught fire for no reason
he says on the vzbot discord
cheers
not a bad thing, add one wherever you can, and tell me how those dry ceramic ball bearings compare to your worst linear rail while dry
I got it for 25 plus tax
F
Huh
Lowest I saw it was 15
And sale
It was discounted tho since I used new user discounts and coupons
I got mine for 25
And proven
Cheap
Well the skr pro or gtr and m5 is pretty chrap
sorry for the inconvenience, i thiught when they said power input they meant it for the steppers
oh so you mean as long as i only use 40v on stepper power its fine, just dont do it anywhere else
yup
I have and I dont understand. It says the terminal maxes out at 28 bur replace the capacitors to do 40v
Wait wut. The power terminal cant take 48v thi
Ah. It looks like I could get new capacitors but the terminal is rated for 28v maximum
So even with the terminal for motor power I can only use 28v?
Cool
Do I need a 60v psu or just another 24v lead
Skr pro it is. Guess Ill be looking for high voltage tmc5160 and a new psu
Nice
Does the skr pro have one
Any changes to the board required
oh well, saw them for a couple bucks and thought it would be nice
cause with dicounts i caqn get it for ¬£2
would this be good for 40v stepper motor driving
What jumpers have you set for the drv8825?
Might just be my mobile viewer then making the config funky
Sensorless or microswitch?
If you've not got a 5160 in there should the endstop pin not be commented out. Otherwise that looks fine. You haven't defined any other pins for the driver?
Let's see the config
Ah I see. One sec
Drv8825 shouldn't need any changes, you just set the jumpers and set the vref
with kiuah yup
fluidd on mobile and mainsail on pc
ah i see, thats a pretty cool way to have the fans set up, u suppose they wouldnt be individually controlled, although im sure you could do some cool stuff with independent cooling fans
you mind sending over the new one, just so i can compare
was it those few aliases that needed changing
woo hoo
cool, lemme l=know if the config works now
any update
alright, i recommend getting kiuah while you're at it. but itsd not necessary
and after downloading angry ip scanner .exe just run it and enter 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.1.255
heres the menu for naming
also make sure youve named your pc otherwise itll be hard to know whats what
i use angry ip scanner, its got a nicer interface
do you mean find the ip address?
good, good. just checking that you werent mistakenly supplying the wrong voltage
it can,  is it an official psu
also, what voltage do you have feeding the pi
last two suggestions is a clean install if youve still got all the files or a full restart
ah sorry, this is about as far as my knowledge goes
i dont have my pi setup rn but is it not in either of the moonraker/ moonraker-env folders
i think if you can connect by putty it would be connected
winscp?
whats it say?
i meant moonraker log sorry
tbh this is kinda out of my scope of knowledge
clicking those buttons doesnt help either?
try that in the command line thingy
sudo systemctl restart moonraker
kiuah installs klipper and fluidd for you, saves a lot of time
do you have kiuah installed?
alr, gimme a sec
oh, moonraker. so it kinda connecs but not really, does it connect by putty
is it connected by wifi or ethernet
phew, nothing fw based
after changing fw or before
if it all works power down and put it in
test without lcd plugged in first
the exp ive got there should work for the screen with a spinny wheel
paste this
    # EXP1 header
    EXP1_1=PC5, EXP1_3=PB1, EXP1_5=PE10, EXP1_7=PE12, EXP1_9=<GND>,
    EXP1_2=PB0, EXP1_4=PE9, EXP1_6=PE11, EXP1_8=PE13, EXP1_10=<5V>,
    # EXP2 header
    EXP2_1=PA6, EXP2_3=PE7, EXP2_5=PB2, EXP2_7=PC4,   EXP2_9=<GND>,
    EXP2_2=PA5, EXP2_4=PA4, EXP2_6=PA7, EXP2_8=<RST>, EXP2_10=<NC>,
    # heaters, fans and thermistors
    bed=PD7, bed_therm=PA1,
    hotend_heater=PB3, hotend_therm=PA2, 
    cooling_fan_1=PB5, cooling_fan_0=PB6,
then
remove everything under aliases first
<@!817398544461070377> paste this in under 'aliases:'
I'll fix that in a sec
Ah alright
oh <@!817398544461070377>
changed [fan_1]   ----->   [fan fan_1]
you had a naming issue i think
and it should work
try out this config, ive removed most of the junk and made it a lot more readable
cya
alr, send it whenever your happy with it
send your config
hm
that should be m106 S
theres hundreds of commandw
sure thing, got a specific example?
its been a while but technically yes
some can be ported but not a whole ton
go directly to klipper
or a screen connected via exp1/2
on klipperscreen
what kind of glitches?
phew
is that a skip at 5 seconds in? or just a part of the move
The flow rate can be changed in there and that value is saved
are u using mainsail or such
And the bigger MOSFETs are good for the chonk-tastic fans
Ez
Just define it'd output pins as a fans
Yup
depending on what you get you can reference maze's github and others configs, but always triple check it and make it your own. everyones hardware is different and you should avoid being reliant on others for this
which mainboard are you running
To check its good in furute use stepper_buzz stepper x
Its what i run on my corexy
Afaik its still 40
and did you unswap the cables if you swapped them
did nit homke correctly before the belts
was it working normally earlier
my printer did this
nice
yeah make sure all the belts are similiarly tensioned, use a rubber band and pull to check if its equal
are the other steppers identical
To check if its a driver thing
To the motor
Try swapping your wires on the steppers and homing at max sensitivity
No problem. I'm also relative Noob with klipper but I also have no clur why it does both
Dump_TMC stepper_x
That isnt right. You should be able to do one at a time. Do you have a homing override secrion
query endtops after homing x and screen shot it
so it seems that even with both motors tuning you have aproblem in the config and not in the physical parts
or never stops no matter the value
and the carriage does stop no matter the value
so this is corexy, right?
whats that sense resistor for, i dont have that on my config
But physical looks fine
Can you send as a text file or as a message
<@!337696404623327242>
also query endstops
send your config and check the physical pin is there
Dang that sucks. Thankfully i live in a very comfortable area where the worst that happened was a few stabbings wich is expected in london
Nice
i wish klipper supported btt tft, they have the lcd mode but not the touchscreen

hello, a user under this name (gorrol00 #7784)  sent me a fraudulent message, this is the only mutual server i have with them
or the metal panel on the very bottom of the printer thats bolted to the frame
the plate that supports the bed that moves with the z axis?
better on solid ground tho ü§î
lets go!!! toss it on the tarmac
time is ticking lad
ive only got annecdotal evidence but i baked mine just under its glass transistion temp for a few hours (sandwiched between two glass sheets) then let it cool slowly inside the oven and it helped flatten it
you can try press fit with a vice
is the holder too tight?
On my bed slinger ive got a small 220x220 keenovo that I'm happy with
or FR4
Is that the same as G10
and just thought they were for funny screws or something
got a few of them bangin around my toolbox
so thats what the cone thingy is
soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
ah so the leadscrew can shake but the bed wont
the oldham coupler lets it move left and right but no rotation right
ah cool
if you have a laser engraver you could engrave the metal bed for the fun of it
Uneven heating could cause a lot of warping
Surfaces take longer to heat, corners stay cooler
Yes but no
or grind on a flat but its fine without either
you can add some locktite if they slip
Hemera shouldn't be too heavy
By heavy we mean dd and a alum x extrusion with plastic idlers and a stealthburner alike toolhead
from what i understand, no. itll sound funny and shake maybe but there **shouldnt **be any damage
i honestly ant tell you an exact yes or no. i could say the larger one will have more rotor inertia and higher inductance but higher torque
the lower the inductance the higher the speed ive been told. but it all depends what you want from these
high torque
ngl if your motor is at egg cooking temp its time to reconsider where youve placed those motors
boron nitride is a thermal epoxy i think or just a glue. either way thermal epoxy is just permanent thermal paste
how much of the backplate is solid metal?
i just assume +- 5c
yup, i got a pack of 5 for 6 GBP from amazon
its just fun
yup, no need for so many
dual mcu, stock board+ skr pro
stepper driver temp
bed and hotend
2 for processor chips
2 for motors
2 for the enclosure
i can measure everything
im at 9 rn
if you have a cheap heatsink you can drill out a hole or push a thermistor inbetween the fins and solder it in place or thermal epoxy it in place with somehting like boron nitride, then use a thermal paste to attach to a motor
Yeah I think there was no speed to gain from them and they only get recommended if you have a heavy ass gantry
i would watch teaching techs video on closed loop steppers for a goiod guide through how they work
for me, no. but i run my printers at stable speeds without skips
teaching tech has a vid on it
similar to servos
thats a encoder on the stepper
Ldo custom order
Unsure of the exact model tho
Theres some large beefy torquey motor that goes quite quick
use rms, but im no pro with the power calculations, from what i remeber amps stay constant but youcan always lower it if they get too hot
Quick explanation of current setting on TMC drivers. the value you put in should be the RMS value. not peak value that is written on the stepper.
The calculation of RMS from peak current is this:
Motor_Peak_Current x 0.707

Since we don't want to push the motors with 100% we'll do:
Motor_Peak_Current x 0.707 x 0.80

That will give us a 20% safety margin.
On a stock Ender 3 motor that is 0.84A peak 
0.84x0.707x0.8 = 0.47A

So you input 0.47 in run_current of your TMC stepper. 

A normal 1.4A stepper is:
1.4x0.707x0.8 = 0.79A

so you put 0.79 in run_current of your tmc stepper. 

the Hold current there is no "rule" about. i like to do Run_Current - 0.2
This will depend on the use case.
you gotta use rms
2.5 max
voltage changes amps you run with doesnt
if you have both you can compare them in a text editor and see wg=hats different
yeah if you needed the torque then you would have to get it but otherwise its not worth it
its a lot more mass for not much gain, theres not just a thin metal rod to spin, its also all the magnets and other bits
They're 2209
Or watch alex kennis' vid on stepper whine
If you musdt try dampeners
Yes. They're good but the high torque perform a little better
Hows higher microstepping do ya at those accelerations
Either you have excessive vibrations ruining the motors power in which case a better frame is needed or youve got some voodoo magic
Input shaper does not improve speed, it improves quality at speed. Quality at speed‚â†higher speed
Its from more emf iirc wich means less acel
What current did you set vs what vez set
Cheers
Any guides or is this a scroll through spec sheets and figure it out
Can this be copy pasted to my config or is a driver to driver basis

The slo mo noise and video is dope tho
Too high or too low
Woulsnt this introduce vibration to the belt ans give you wobbly funky prints
And I was gonna be running 3 120mm deltas and was worried it was too small
Looks like delta, although I may be wrong
Yup, and those are proper server fans
He just got an external cooling module, 2 fans and a duct and showed a water test, check it out on his channel the water goes ∆Éu·¥â él…ü
Dang that looks really really cool, its a shame it wouldnt work for my design
So once I takr thr pi abd steppers off it should run fine
Ah cool, well I have a 350 in there ppwering a pi and the board and steppers and bed and a 2nd board for themristors
If I know how much power I draw (from the psu ratings and assume I'm using peak power) is there a way to find the cost per hour of electricity
Ah that makes sense now. I guess stuff uses less power than I thought
I'm gonna use it to power my pi as well since the pi uses less than 150w
Oh cool so a small 48v 250w psu is fine
Alright I'm just holding off since its costly
And this wont strain the psu any more
If I get a good one that delivers enough amps then I'm golden
So theres no downside to using a booster
Right
I would be better off getting a dedicated psu
Maybe
The mass cant be made or destroyed one
Probably
If that makes sense
If I use a step up converter for my stepper motor power would I have higher voltage but less current or would I have more power overall
Oh yeah those are very annoying
Welp I guess for the budget enthusiast drv cut it but no point saving 10 bucks if you dont care about it
Ah true
Assuming perfect conditions
If voltage and amperage and driver settings are the same as far as they can be. Will torque change
For e why not drv
5160 right
what she said
thats
Do drv8825 have that problem since theyre a lot cheaper and can do 45v and a fairly high amperage
well, the skr pro can be modified for any voltage and i guess you could use a step up converter or a 48v psu with step down converters
Ooh. Snazy
Ah so should I do a large square and a higher corner speed (whats yours set to)
i might run that as a macro but only one layer
nice
ah, so a large oval would be the best
i think that was on 2
and then ill be upgrading to 38v
im fairly certain its slowing down, so as soon as my new board arrives ill rety on straight moves
printers down for the count rn (my board caught fire) but lemme check if i have a vid of it
2209
its a miracle it works and i have a feeling my mcu is slowing down the moves even thoug its klipper
and its with 64 microsteps and no interpolation, and e5 stock steppers
yep
325mm/s
really, ive got 125k on non square moves working
you have to set 28v in a config somewhere
true
¬£16 damn, i found a few on aliexpress for 10 (4 total) but that was with 2 coupons and a sale
wont a higher voltage make them run cooler
i can drop the duty cycle to .3-.7
well if i buy a super cheap heater then i can run at higher voltages and have the power of 50+ then sign me up
cuase if not ill run my bed and hotend on that and just get a 30w heater for the hotend
is it gonna break the thing
is that bad
hm, i may do that
cool, whichever i can get for a good price ill use
guess ill do 35v then, do step up converter exist so i can power the steppers from my 24v supply at 35v
wait can i not do 40v on 5160 and sensorless
dope
sorry meant will they do 40v (im getting hi voltage 5160s' seen) and can a 2209 supply the amperage for now
I thibk the voltage is fine but shouldnt 2209 stay at 2.0A or less
At 40v
Can I run them on 2209
So those wantai
48mm
ah, i just found a set of 3 steppers for 12 with those specs and 59Ncm holding torque
ah ill look for 1.8 or less then
oh well
and 1.4ohm resistqnce
is an inductance of 3.0mh good
Well I could always find some v8 engines ya know
in theory if its double shafted i can cool it using a fan blades glued to the shaft
i can rip my nelts to shreds with lawnmowers
thats not a no
wait
Cause my neighbour is throwing 2 away
I can mount it myself and I can find an adapter
Could I use 2 lawn mower motors and odrive as steppers
yes
Are those expensive
You could but you dont need to, a .9 could be better but it depends what size layers you use (finer layers shouod have a geared z or .9 motor
Also <@509772297289072653>. Check out this forum
Dang I really need more money to try this
yeah, so i got a ender 5 second hand at ¬£30 (BARGAIN) and started modding, tried adding a v6 and didnt tighten the mount fully and got terrible wobbly prints, so i figured i was pushing speeds at 70mm/s (stupid, i know) so i found the zero-g project and built it, then the vzbot so im combining the two and building a printer
and slapped a .6mm nozzle on it and tried going fast
true but i wanted speed, so i got a cr10s pro with its honking massive 400mmx400mmx4mm metal bed
and have since been searching for a good corexy
got a 3d printer because i saw one going fast and thought, huh i want one of those, so i got a cartesian (like  A IDIOT)
nah uk
14
although i think i take youngest member
hahahahahah poggers g
<@!509772297289072653>  only 70k, what speed
ah, thanks, ill stick to 24v for now then
is there a step up converter i could use for steppers or would the easiest solution just be a new board
how do you upgrade to a higher voltage if your board doesnt allow it
but i guess more power means jerk-ier movements
i think not
coincidence
`amp` and `amp`litude
damn your lucky, that thing is just a massive 70g chunk of copper with a heater
and liquid cooling and over volting
image a 8wd with these motors
dang, i gotta see o drive motors on a printer, cant wait!
holy moly
have u done the english plan
thats cool
imma try one this weekend
ah well
start at 9 ish
wanna do a p2 practice tonight

The beating drum of the storm drew closer, a parade of marching rain and clashing thunder. Clouds let loose a barrage of water. Their droplets beating out like a drum. Winds weave and twist past. they slide between buildings; their mischievous howls piercing the land. Explosive batteries of lighting blast above- buildings tremble beneath their might.
in singh songh the writer utilises comedy to emphasize how joyous his relationship is with his wife despite its issues, this contrasts the aggressive love seen through natural imagery in sonnet 29. the speaker in singh songh "after vee hav made luv\ like vee rowing through Putney" this original metaphor creates a vigorous and humours tone reflecting their unusual relationship. the use of a dialect in writing emphasises their relationship as it‚Äôs a blend between british and indian culture, this is seen in the quote "brightey moon" where the use of a romantic symbol of the moon and dialect combine to show the speakers love for his wife and her blended culture. the speaker‚Äôs aggressive tone in sonnet 29 is seen in the quote "wild vines", the use of wild brings connotations of uncontrollable love and the use of natural language "vines‚Äù further accentuates her feelings of strong love towards her husband. This aggressive tone is continued in the phrase ‚Äúand let these bands of greenery‚Ä¶drop‚Ä¶burst, shattered everywhere‚Äù this shows the speaker is not content with only their thoughts of their lover and would rather have physical contact. Their strong love is seen in the word ‚Äúburst‚Äù reflecting how the speaker feels as if she‚Äôll burst if she cannot contact her lover. This aggressive desire contrasts the physical joyous intimacy between the speaker and his wife in singh songh.

Romeo elevates Juliet through the religious image of ‚Äòprofane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims‚Äô. Romeo compares himself as ‚Äòunworthy‚Äô to Juliet as a ‚Äòholy shrine‚Äô, he elevates her above him showing how strongly he loves her. He views her as pure and godly as he believes a physical relationship with her would ‚Äòprofane‚Äô her. He believes being with her would make himself better as he uses the extended metaphor of a pilgrim who‚Äôs travelling to a holy shrine (Juliet). This desire for physical intimacy is also seen in the extract as he exclaims ‚Äòthat I might touch that cheek!‚Äô. The modal ‚Äòmight‚Äô demonstrates how he believes he‚Äôs unworthy of Juliet and the exclamation mark shows his extreme passion towards her.
this one?
yes
whats some good quotes for romeoes feelings to juliet
my paragraph?
Romeo‚Äôs feelings towards Juliet are presented as overwhelming and elevating Juliet. Romeo utilises a celestial metaphor by stating that ‚ÄòJuliet is the sun‚Äô. this celestial imagery elevates her to a higher status by placing her as something unattainable. Furthermore this comparison to the sun juxtaposes  his previous feelings towards rosaline where he created an ‚Äòartificial night‚Äô. This use of the sun/moon reflects his feelings of true love for Juliet and lust for rosaline. Romeo feels overwhelmed when watching her as he says, ‚Äòo it is my love: o that she knew she were!‚Äô. The ‚Äòo‚Äô is repeated as hes overcome and at a loss for words. This is reinforced by the use of a exclamation mark.

What structure is there
What'd you write for q2
<@570584291495378988>
<@792752630362406922> u done the English writing
1.    A funeral pyre as high as her roof
2.    A photo of Aeneas, a sword and his clothes
3.    Virgil is very effective in his writing style. The anaphora of ‚Äúquaedam‚Ä¶quaedam‚Äù meaning ‚Äúa certain someone‚Äù creates a accusatory tone towards dipsas . the alliterative phrases ‚Äúnigri non‚Äù highlights the negative tones through the repeated ‚Äún‚Äù sound
4.    A priestess is also there who has a thunderous voice
5.    Three hundred
6.    Having three bodies
7.    Shes a virgin
8.    Theyre very powerful and will help her get revenge on Aeneas
9.    To represent the river of the underworld
10.    Powerful herbs
11.    By harvesting them with  bronze sickle
12.    A young baby horses forehead
13.    Dido has her feet bare and fastenings undone
14.    A divine power that cares for lovers in unfair relations, as her and aeneas‚Äôs relationship is unequal
15.    Virgil uses a range of techniques to make the impression of menace throughout.
<@689804811897536536> latin q's
<@792752630362406922> <@719834578302271528>
1.    The sound waves are longitudinal which parallel to the energy transfer, whereas the water waves are transverse and vibrate means they vibrate perpendicular to the direction of energy.
2.    1/(8.3/1000)=120.5
3.    
‚Ä¢    place an object of known size on the screen and calculate the magnification of the screen by dividing image size by actual size
‚Ä¢    remove the object then turn on the oscillator and strobe to 25hz so that the waves on the screen appear frozen
‚Ä¢    measure the total length of the screen and count the number of waves
‚Ä¢    use the magnification  to get the real distance 
‚Ä¢    calculate wavelength by dividing total distance by the number of waves

the IF25a doesnt work on certain modes, i havent dropped the torch ever and its been sat in storage for the pat few months. the torch wont turn on in turbo or in bike flasher mode (though the greeen switch indicator light does flash) on the ramp the light will turn on until about halfway when the LEDs turn off. from this is seems clear one driver channel just doesnt work, id greatly appreciate a replacement head for the light as im not comfortable replacing the driver. To troubleshoot ive tried 3 different batteries an d cleaning all contacts. this shows the issue im having youtube.com/watch?v=-W9XxG5KkeM

As mentioned previously, the plastic ribbon must first be manually fed into the nozzle apparatus from the slicer until the motor can take over and pull it the rest of the way through.

The first nozzle build utilized old parts from an Ender 3 printer and included a red heatsink (see arrow 4) that I drilled-out to an 11mm diameter, using a stepped drill, to facilitate the passage of the ribbon through the nozzle. The nozzle itself was designed to be 1.8mm wide, allowing the filament to stretch and reach the target diameter of 1.75mm. A fan was also mounted above the heatsink (arrow 5) to prevent overheating and premature melting of the ribbon. The entire assembly was then mounted onto a metal computer hard drive caddy (arrow 6) because a 3D-printed mount would not be able to withstand the working temperature (~150C).

Unfortunately, my design was flawed as the 30W heater struggled to adequately heat the nozzle given the added thermal mass of the hard drive caddy. In the second iteration, the hard drive caddy was retained for wire routing and mounting purposes, but a stainless steel shelf bracket (arrow 7) was used instead to hold the nozzle and block. This reduced the amount of heat transferred, which solved that issue, but then the bracket was too high, causing some misalignment with the other components. 

A potential third iteration of the nozzle build could utilise metal tubes (similar to Slice Engineering‚Äôs Mosquito Hotend) to suspend the block, reducing heat transfer and improving performance. However, these parts would need to be purchased, which is contrary to one of my project aims. Other design changes or modifications could be implemented to address the issues with the previous iterations, such as using a more powerful heater or a different material for the mount.

2.    They sacrifice grains, animals, wine and spices to the gods to attempt to ward off evil
3.    Hes partially mocking them as he tells nasidius jokingly to shut up or stop sleeping which is clearly impossible and humorous
4.    He says that nasidianus comes to him in the early morning to tell him about the dreams, suggesting it happens all the time
5.    Last years wine has been all used up and only the last bits are left at the bottom of the barrel, this years vintage refers to the wine too as it has to be left to age

Reputation: a central theme of the novella is reputation, Stevenson explores the contrasting public images of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and the consequences of their actions on their reputations, this idea is explored in jekylls transformation and the dangers of attempting to maintain a false image.
Evil/justice: the two themes of justice and violence are explored throughout the novella, as seen through the actions of Mr. Hyde and the consequences he faces. The use of foreshadowing and character development helps to build suspense and highlight the destructive nature of violence

<@689148727818059859>
<@792752630362406922>
‚Ä¢ The novella "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" by Robert Louis Stevenson is
structured around letters and documents that reveal the story to the reader.
‚Ä¢ The letters serve as a metaphor for the divided self, with one part of the person writing
and the other watching.
The city of London in the story is structured like an envelope, with various sealed and
private spaces that must be opened in order to fully understand the story.
‚Ä¢ The sealed documents and letters also contribute to the metaphor of the tale,
representing the dual nature of the main character, Dr. Jekyll, and his alter ego, Mr. Hyde.
‚Ä¢ The story is told through an impersonal narrator relating the actions, conversations, and
movements of the characters, including Utterson, Enfield, Jekyll, Lanyon, and Poole.
‚Ä¢ As the narrator begins to draw attention to a series of written documents, the reader
becomes aware of their significance and becomes increasingly eager to reach the final
sections of the book, "Dr. Lanyon's Narrative" and "Henry Jekyll's Full Statement of the
Case," in which envelopes are unsealed to reveal letters that reveal the truth.
‚Ä¢ The structure of the novella is like a series of envelopes within envelopes, with each
enclosure contributing to the solution of the mystery.
‚Ä¢ The sealed documents and letters serve to organize the story and impart its metaphor of
the divided self and the dual nature of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
The epistolary form plays a significant role in the structure and metaphor of Robert Louis Stevenson's novella "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde." The story is driven by letters and other written documents, such as Jekyll's will, that must be unsealed and read in order to uncover the mystery at the heart of the tale. The letters serve not only to organize the story but also to impart its metaphor of the divided self, as the act of writing a letter involves one aspect of a person taking control of the pen while another watches. In addition, the setting of the story, the city of London, is described as being like a series of sealed envelopes that must be opened in order to understand the full extent of the action. The use of the epistolary form and the metaphor of the sealed envelope serve to highlight the themes of secrecy and revelation in the novella.

In chapter seven Stevenson uses the window symbolically to present themes and ideas about duality, Victorian respectability, and coverup culture. The half-open window can be seen as a metaphor for the incomplete nature of Jekyll's identity, as it allows only a partial view of what is happening inside. The sudden closing of the window when Jekyll's friends see his expression of "abject terror and despair" can be interpreted as a symbol of Jekyll's efforts to conceal his true self and maintain the facade of respectability expected of him in Victorian society. the use of the word "terror" suggests that Jekyll is deeply afraid of the consequences of revealing hyde and the potential damage to his reputation and social standing. In Victorian society, there was a strong emphasis on maintaining respectability and upholding certain moral standards, and any deviation from these expectations could lead to ostracization and shame. Jekyll's "terror" can be seen as a reflection of this societal pressure and the consequences of not conforming to the expectations of his time. This can also be seen as a commentary on the theme of the duality of human nature and the difficulties of maintaining a single identity in the face of societal expectations. Throughout the novel, windows and doors serve as symbols of boundaries and divisions, and Jekyll's use of them to keep his two selves separate reflects the theme of the duality of human nature and the complexities of identity. This can be seen as a commentary on the Victorian culture of covering up and the pressure to conform to societal expectations.
Chapter 7: 
Task 1: Write one paragraph analysing how Stevenson uses the window symbolically in this chapter to present themes and ideas. Consider:
‚Ä¢    The half-open window
‚Ä¢    Jekyll‚Äôs response to the idea of coming out
‚Ä¢    The window instantly thrust down
‚Ä¢    The symbolism of windows and doors throughout the whole novel
‚Ä¢    Links to Stevenson and context
Chapter 8: 
Task 2: Write a paragraph in response to this question and extract: 
How does Stevenson use language and structure to create tension?
It was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lying on her back as though the wind had tilted her, and a flying wrack of the most diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made talking difficult, and flecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have swept the streets unusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had never seen that part of London so deserted. He could have wished it otherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish to see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there was borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The square, when they got there, was all full of wind and dust, and the thin trees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole, who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the middle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off his hat and mopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief. But for all the hurry of his coming, these were not the dews of exertion that he wiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face was white and his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken.
"Well, sir," he said, "here we are, and God grant there be nothing wrong."

moles by dr suess
<@792752630362406922>
Oh, the moles of chemistry,
A concept that's quite tricky,
But once you understand,
It's really quite grand!

A mole is a unit,
Of measurement, to be blunt,
It represents a certain amount,
Of atoms or molecules, in a huff.

You see, atoms are quite small,
And difficult to count at all,
But with the mole, we have a way,
To measure them, every day.

And so, the mole is quite useful,
For chemists and scientists, who are dutiful,
In studying the world around,
At the atomic level, it can be found.

So, that's a bit about moles,
A concept that can be quite wholesome,
For those who study chemistry,
And seek to understand the world, you see.

SHUT UP ABOUT THE QEEEURS
Sure, here is a song with a similar message and pacing:

Verse 1:
Life is a journey, full of twists and turns
But you don't have to face it all alone
You are the captain of your own fate
So don't be afraid to take the lead

Chorus:
You paddle your own canoe
You're in control, don't let others steer you
Stay true to yourself and you'll make it through
Just keep paddling, your own canoe

Verse 2:
You'll encounter storms and rough waters
But don't be afraid to weather them
Hold on to your dreams and never give up
You are stronger than you know

Chorus:
You paddle your own canoe
You're in control, don't let others steer you
Stay true to yourself and you'll make it through
Just keep paddling, your own canoe

Bridge:
So don't be afraid to chart your own course
And don't let anyone tell you what to do
You are the master of your own destiny
So keep paddling, your own canoe

Chorus:
You paddle your own canoe
You're in control, don't let others steer you
Stay true to yourself and you'll make it through
Just keep paddling, your own canoe.

Development Dynamics
India
‚Ä¢    10% English speaking
‚Ä¢    65% of population are working age
‚Ä¢    GDP increased from 300 ÔÉ†1800 
‚Ä¢    Low minimum wage is attractive to TNC‚Äôs
‚Ä¢    Change in tax laws encouraged FDI
‚Ä¢    Environment:
    o        Coca cola over uses water leaving local farmers waterless
    o        Wastewater is dumped into rivers, lots of water supplies become undrinkable

Coca cola
‚Ä¢    Employs 25,000 people
‚Ä¢    Indian government supplies free water, beneficial for production
‚Ä¢    Relaxed environmental laws- allows for exploitation
‚Ä¢    Developed infrastructure for India- transport, communication, power etc
‚Ä¢    Traditional vendors who‚Äôre beaten by coca cola are forced into poverty

Aviva
‚Ä¢    Employs 1800 English speaking people
‚Ä¢    Employs mainly young people, low skill

RuralÔÉ†urban movement
‚Ä¢    Pro: young people reach further education and can attain skilled jobs
‚Ä¢    Cons: many can‚Äôt afford the cost of living in the urban areas; old generation farmers can‚Äôt retire as there‚Äôs no youth to take over their job

In a large, open field, a group of children can be seen running and laughing as they play a game of tag. Amidst the group of children, a familiar face stands out. It is Saddam Hussein, the former dictator of Iraq, now reduced to playing a simple game of tag with a group of young children. Hussein wears a wide grin on his face as he runs and dodges, trying to avoid being tagged by the other children. Despite his past as a ruthless leader, in this moment he is just a child, enjoying the simple pleasures of a game of tag.

U got the others still?
Worker ants in suits, they march from concrete tower to tower. Work. Sleep. Repeat. They march in a daze of exhaustion- all united by a familiar grey pall of the skin. An unhealthy glow of smog surrounds them. A unmotivated wind tumbles over the crowds, the beginnings of rain slip out of the crowds eliciting a common lethargic sigh. They scuttle under cover, clearing out of the rain, leaving only taxi-cab Beatles in the streets
We both wrote about the same thing
They pelted down, carpet bombing the land. The grey clouds shot out water like a machine gun; each drop accelerating like bullets down to the houses below. They relentlessly sieged the helpless infrastructure below. The boisterous wind like cavalry, flanking and destroying the little defences in place. People ran for cover, pulling out umbrellas and running into their home. Children in their homes hid behind their parents, they watched and heard the hostile rain clattering against the window.
How's Marc's
Thanks naomi
Too kind
<@1037817156840198196> how's my creative writing
The beating drum of the storm drew closer, a parade of marching rain and clashing thunder. Clouds let loose a barrage of water. Their droplets beating out like a drum. Winds weave and twist past. they slide between buildings; their mischievous howls piercing the land. Explosive batteries of lighting blast above- buildings tremble beneath their might.

Priestly presents a range of ideas through the closing of the play, the main three being responsibility seen through the inspector‚Äôs final monologue, sexism in Gerald and Sheila‚Äôs relationship and socialism which permeates throughout the entire play. The play was performed in 1946 and set in 1912 only a few years before WW1- allowing Priestley to the mistakes of a pre-war society. Many ideas explored were very relevant to the contemporary audience.

JCoSS has agreed to allow students to watch the England vs Iran match on Monday if they wish.
The school doesn‚Äôt pay attention to petitions, but it does listen to points carefully made by members of the Head Student Team who were keen to to represent the opinion of the student body ‚Ä¶and that is what led to this decision.
Please remember that while some staff and students are passionately interested in this match, many are not. 
With the World Cup controversially being held in Qatar many students and teachers are boycotting the tournament. 
Their views and choices must be respected in a true JCoSS, Menchlichkeit manner.
The deal is:
1. The human rights issues in Qatar, are well known.  If you watch the match you are expected to make a donation towards a charity in this area. Please bring in ¬£1 if you are expecting to watch the match and hand this to your form teacher during AM registration. 
2. You must register for lessons and form time in the correct room as usual ‚Äì not to wherever your friends have gone - this means attending period 4, PM registration and period 5 as usual -
the game will be shown in your usual classrooms under teacher supervision. 
3. For those who do not wish to watch the match, teachers will arrange for you to swap into another room nearby that is not showing it.  If your class is not watching the match, we will arrange for you to swap into a class that is. Staff will decide who goes where; do not simply walk out or head straight to a different room.
4. You can watch the match during lunchtime if you are in a classroom with a member of staff.  You can‚Äôt be in a classroom unsupervised and you can‚Äôt watch it on your phone.
5. When the final whistle blows, all lessons return to normal

The topic of 3d printing is incredibly under researched as it‚Äôs such a fast-moving technology especially at a hobbyist level, much of the applicable research comes from individual blogs and forums so finding repeated results can be very difficult.
Much of my knowledge on the topic of 3d printing comes from years of reading and firsthand experience which made finding specific information easier. And much of my knowledge of shofars is from anecdotal experience or from JE in school though much of the information I needed wasn‚Äôt readily available.
‚Äú3D printing is a manufacturing process in which material is laid down, layer by layer, to form a three-dimensional object‚Äù  (Hoffman, n.d.), this process can take advantage of a variety of materials and can be used to create intricate shapes otherwise not possible, since 3d printers aren‚Äôt limited to cutting and shaping preexisting material they can build intricate and intertwined objects. This makes them well suited to shofar production as the design can be shaped for both strength and aesthetics without compromising functionality. Traditional shofars are made with ‚Äúa horn that is hollow in its wide part, but sealed at its narrow edge. Heat is applied to enable straightening part of the horn, then it is polished on the outside and an air-passage hole is drilled in the narrow part‚Äù (Bigman, n.d.) this is a very laborious process which requires skill and delicacy as the horn is easily cracked or broken during the heating and forming stages. 3d printing on the other hand is mostly automated and requires very little human input once correctly setup.

Ayo coppa club airlines
Wait whend Liam get here
Oh no Mr crabs
Wtf happened here
Now got two tone skin
Forgot sunscreen
Near Dupont or Dominican
People with PTFE lined hotends in 3d printers have issues with small animals dying (especially ones on the ground) since the tube inside can deteriorate and release neurotoxins that settle on the ground, so tiny animals will suffocate and die before tall people even notice
Any town near a Dupont factory is full of neurotoxins and carcinogenics
It's got funky bacteria apparently
Yeah but that's for locals
<@751492479525847111>
Dominican Republic
But the fancy hotel gives us water cartons for free
The tap water, extra no
No
The pool water
Very American photo
Here's all of us
Yeah if you tried
I can run on ground with him on my shoulders

Life advice from my brother:
1.No one can truly force you to do anything
2.Fashionable is what's comfortable
3.Once you start drinking, don't trust your farts because everyone's shit themselves at some point
Doing hide and seek and I got the annoying cousin
Lmao

its a matte black surafec, the layers blend well
different plastics, tpu can be flexible, theres different shore ratings on each filament
and start second print with cf pla and make sure they dont overlap
start tpu as one print

i wanna combine tpu and cf pla for a phone case

Cool
Rip
Hows it <@689148727818059859>
Especially with the more recent updates improving performance
I trust the engineers to improve the stability and quality
But you'll end up making it worse
So you'll havw to change it both ways
It has to be decodes on the headset
Fairly certain it's 200mbps
It's not. They have a proprietary compressor
Retard
9 am here
They have some special compression thingy so not h.264 and again you won't be pixel peaking in vr
And USB is in the micro seconds of delay and you insisted on using a pcie card
Wifi6e has 2-6 millisecond of latency and you told me that's too much and wired is better
Oh for fucks sake
Wireless?
Heavily modded android
Look tldr. Bluetooth is a no go; short wired headphones are great; speakers are a bad idea because no one likes beatsaber music;
Or wired
Just use the built in
Especially if they aren't also playing
And no one wants to hear beatsaber music
That will add some delay
Just buy some single headphone+wire with a short cable
It's still very delayed and not worth the audio improvement
Buds2
And I've used Bluetooth headphones on beat saber. It's dogshit
That's why I don't play pcvr beatsaber
A technology with inherent latency on a fast paced rhythm game
<@751492479525847111> you want to use a Bluetooth headset for beatsaber
Bluetooth?
Hehehehehehehe

That's what it felt like

Yes
300mbps is all you really need. It's compressed

Yeah that's a fair price. It's got the oculus logo so it's a collectors item
Oh fine then you would loose the games
So sell account and headset as a bundle
Yes
Yeah signing up with a link gives both parties 23 quid
Then sell games with the headset
Yeah so 220 or around is fine. <@792752630362406922> are the games on a fake Facebook account
Q2 how much did you buy it for. Cause it's pretty much unused
Bozo ‚úÖ
Cheaper???
Same controller??
Look at bozoz
<@689148727818059859>
Bozo
No no. Leon's saying with the quest generally there's issues
What issues. Also make sure to get good controllers they make a huge difference (and if you find a replacement joystick lemme know where)
I'll just find another friend
Friday
We lost the lizard
Nearly stood on the fella
Yummy
Ye
There's a lizard under the couch
9pm here bitch
Finally got a good connection and 6 copy's of the song
Nvm
Yup
Got a clickable link?
Can't get the files to download
May as well hand encode the audio
Manual math would be faster
Yup
Sideswiped was so intensive it forced a restart
Im sure
The phone cost 99 quid
Aptx would be great but my phone doesn't support that
conoression
I usually use AAC for my headphones
Please reduce <@751492479525847111>
Nvm still stutters
Yet
I forced sbc streaming and there's no stutters yes
One sec
Built-in speaker
Please just try reduce so I can rule this out
Same stuttering
Even on speaker
Ye
Just make sure it keeps its quality. But make it so it uses less CPU to listen to
Oje
<@751492479525847111> mind reducing the quality of my music philes
So a monthly fee is more affordable
And some people can't spend large lump sums
For performance alone a console is better for the cost, especially second hand
And they have a nasty bite
Yup
L. They're either the 2+TB or under 400gb. Nothing mid sized
ü§¢
I nearly stood on this 8 inch long horror
Most were 40gb drives
All 1tb+ are alive
Still have quite a few left
Nop
Hard drives
<@751492479525847111> this is at least 1gb storage

Tomorrow morning (before 12 GMT) I can video call and walk you through filament <@430380494795046923>
12 quid
Most of them are in the ¬£40-120 range
This is one of the hard drive I have
<@751492479525847111>  
And when you move it by hand filament comes out
Hm
Yes
Tell me if it clicks or makes any noise
And wait
Move it 200
Bruh u making 0 sense
Bitch I'm not a mind reader
Send a annotated picture
Eh
It's gotta go somewhere
Leave it extruding for a while
There is no war in ba sing se
Yes
Can u hear me
I'll get on now
Nearly
But I'll respect the guys privacy and do it for him if not
Nah they should be
Short story made shorter: I said "gimme old drives" and a guy said "okay pay shipping" and I said "jam in as many as possible"
The deportation dude said I could have a snack
But most of them will be scrapped
That's why I'll 3d print a case
Nop
I will
Rip
New pencil sharpener????
Yup
Circle it
Use coordinates
Which
12 quid
<@751492479525847111> I'm gonna go swim with the 4tb drive
And another 4tb
1 3tb drive
Also read the labels, like 9tb of storage over 4 drives
Guess how much I payed
Guess what
<@751492479525847111>
Just got in rental car
Pm
6 30
<@430380494795046923> everything working?
Danny suffers sever mental retardation
Nop
What
Sure do
It knows all
Follow the website
Yes
The first layer
Otherwise just do it while printing normally
Kinda
For the first few t o make sure the first layer is ok
Print a large flat cube really slowly and adjust the knobs to get it right
That's to make it consistent. When you start printing you'll have to raise and lower the nobs to fine tune
Don't worry about that for now
Cool
Scissors
Use the whole role
Heat the hotend and once filament comes out (while you push) then it'll be loaded
And make sure to raise the extruder arm (the one on a spring)
Cut the filament at a angle and just wiggle it around while pushing
Lots
Get photos
It's mainly cosmetic and for temp stability but if there isn't a open window you'll be fine
Yup
If it's scraping and too close raise the bed
If it isn't sticking raise the bed
And first layer
Also send photos of test print
What do you think
Then help
Lemme get through the airport
Rip
Is it working

Very bitter sweet
Wasn't a satisfying ending

Pencil sharpener
new pavlov map <@!689148727818059859>
<@!430380494795046923> 
wee
yes
this guy explains everything really well
and x is carriage
y is the bed
z is up down
when it prints itll move in xy only and then a little in the z so while you could do full 3 axis printing a normal printer will count as 2.5
yup, you can buy rotational axis to add to normal printers
i just know your printer is 2.5 axis
yeah degrees of freedom is more for rotation i think
wait no sorry itll have 6 axis, not dof
2
for non planar 3d printing
and the best part, it can be upgraded to 6 arms and 6 DOF

Also I've ziptied it together as best I can, and put some tape on the bed, just remove all that before printing
Was just about to askz do you want my spare roll of filament to experiment with. I wouldn't use it for tuning the printer but if there's any prints you wanna try that will probably fial you can use the roll
Yup
you run some commands, join a lobby with pin and play 90m of competitive

When it updates we can upgrade to 19 1 or 20.0

i can help with getting klipper working, but not marlin
YEH
Check out the klipper docs and decide if you wanna flash that if not marlin
Other than cable management and the heater it should be fine to print with. Only iffy part is the bed leveling and the tuning but you need to print to do those two. Oh and firmware
Poggies
RGB LED
Look at my insta
Also
Fairly certain afterburner reports highest temp readout
laptop?
hotspot?
any size is good, i should have the right size, if not ive got a dremel
<@751492479525847111>  of you've got any dead hdds can I have them
i dont think this russian to english translation is right
so they wouldnt heat up
but the ones in the fire wouldnt turn on and off often
when the mosfet switches on and off it heats up
those mosfets dont switch on or off very often, wouldnt get hot
caused by backwards capacitor
this board
lemme do some google
under low load they will, remeber the z690 boards that caught fire, it was from a backwards cap and under idle it was mostly fine and just heating up and using excess current, under high load they caught fire
but capcitors (electrlytic) will slowly boil and leak and use excess current under low load iirc and explode under high load
some components wont car
put the electricity in the wrong way round
good klipper guides
lung extension?

Cool
once you get the printer tuned you can aim for higher speeds
and nah theyre the standard starter pirnts
a couple years ago
then a cube
a benchy boat
sort by most popular of alll time to see the easier to print things
itll need supports
not as a first print but it looks like it
nop
ill show u in a slicer how to tell whats printable and not, you also just have to get a feel for it
sls or sla only which uses a laser or 8k lcd to build really detailed parts
the gun part isnt printable on a fdm machine
this part?

nice
'real' recoil
the ffirst one is actually cool tho
ikr
If we can't fix it the electronics are still worth something, same for the extrusions, belts and fasteners
Don't get the filament, I'll lend you a mostly full spool, and send pics of it when you get it

None of those suggestions are dodgy if installed properly
Heat shrink, mb
And just shrinkwrap over the converter
Alternatively just use any old buck converter or synchronous converter on the output pins and then do a little voltmetering and get 9.5v
Most psu have a tl431 chip onboard. You can hook a potentiometer onto the vsense and vcc pin and spin it till you get 9.5v output then just measure the potentiometer resistance and find a fixed resistance resistor to solder on there and close it up and boom 9.5v from normal PSU
Also give it the extra half
9v is ez
Ive got no room to sit
The case is huge
The non touchscreen one
Yeh
1 core
Martins got one of those in his brain
My printer board plus pi use 9w of power at the wall under full load
You could probably run klipper on your l 1x. It'd be a waste since any Android phone could do it as well. But it'd be Cool
Also the predictive tracking gets fucked hard when you play steam VR through oculus air link. So while it helps if you can full swing if you underswing it'll remember and fuck you over
It's not a very visible difference in latency but you'll feel it when you play
Playing pcvr beatsaber over wired is close to native latency but better graphics. Playing native is still the better option when you get to the harder songs. Anything above 12 blocks per second you gotta absolutely minimize latency
But pcvr is light-years ahead
Quest 1 is equivalent in performance to a Xbox one s
Think so
Bruh q2 has the snapdragon xr2 or 3 iirc
Ah, good luck
But we can just print it if needed
I've got all the parts to fix the entire x axis but for one
That's a mostly easy fix
Send a photo of it
Lead screw?
Before u buy ask what's broken
Ah fine one spool, not bad at all
Yeah
How much is lots of filament
150 base price and roughly 20 quid per kilo of filament
Steal of a deal
Great deal
If you need it, I'm happy to lend a hand and parts
From what I last heard from him I might have all the replacement parts on hand

the vpn is limiting me to 12% of my usual download speed
only one done so far
i just gotta wait for the rest of the games to install
thanks
gpu util at 48% max temp 58c
and then its limited to a send rate of 73fps so i just chose a arbitrary number slighlty above the max fps
otherwise steam vr has a hissy fit
had to cap it
render latency of 1.2ms and wifi latency around 8ms
and i had some weird fps issues where i was getting ~2 fps but i did some re-jigging on nvidia control panel and now i run buttery smooth 90fps low latency
its all good now, the vpn my dad has fixed it

So I might find a different rod that fits
Since I'm not great at 3d design and all these parts were designed with ABS in mind the fit is wrong on the spool
Complete spool and motor with press fit drive gear

But again. Trust an independent writer on Forbes or bose
Next time don't be a üí© and give a source
Wasn't too hard now was ir
Not a screen cap
An actual clickable link
It doesn't. Just provide a source for either
Or admit you are üêí brained
Just give one
Any source at all
So give a source for that
If no one on the incrediblly huge internet agrees why would you be correct
So why the duck would you be correct
üêíüêµ
Golly. One request for a source and you can't do it
use a source
ü§°
Every conversation turns into you making baseless claims from anecdotal evidence with no sources. As I say every time give a source or accept you're wrong and pipe the fuck down
You know what. Give a link and a source or fuck off
So alcohol is bad for earwax and ears
Instead of making baseless claims and anecdotes gimme a website or two and stop being a ü§°
Simples
Hydrogen peroxide melts ear wax. Rubbing alcohol displaces water
You fucking ü§°
It melts earwax and doctors sometimes reccomend putting it in your ear
are you illiterate
christ
and boots sold it to me as im underage so its fine
so its safe
i am not
neither is safe if your a dipshit
hugely different and hydrogen peroxide is the way to go
silicone rubber
soap and water isnt fantastic for wax. wax s water resistant
thats just them covering their backs
from bose, they gotta cover their backs
If earwax has built up on your earbuds and cannot be wiped off, follow these steps to remove it.
Remove the tips from your earbuds
Put on protective gloves for your skin before you begin cleaning
Use a soft cloth or tissue to apply a small amount of hydrogen peroxide (3% concentration only) to the mesh surface at the opening of the earbud. Take care not to allow excess liquid to enter the opening
Let the hydrogen peroxide sit for 5 minutes so it can soften the wax
Wet a soft-bristled tooth brush with hydrogen peroxide (3% concentration only)
Gently scrub the mesh surface to loosen and remove the wax. Take care not to allow excess liquid to enter the opening of the earbud
Once clean, gently shake out any excess liquid and debris
Dry earbud with a soft cloth
Before reattaching the eartips, leave your earbuds in the open for an extended period so any excess moisture can dry.
nd rubber isnt used for ear phones
none of those will clesn it tho
silicone is everything in or on skin iirc
rubber wouldnt be good for the ear
if bose says hydroen eroxide imma listen to them
rubbe ris carbon-crbon and silicone is silicon-oxygen
it does destroy rubber tho
no
no, headphone tips are silicone tho
none of those dissolve earwax
The Bose company website recommends hydrogen peroxide to remove earwax. Look for a solution of no more than 3%. Apply it with a cotton swab and merely dampen the surface. Wipe the solution off quickly and carefully when you're done
ive got some hydrogen peroxide to use
are they used
ill probably get those
well thats the first thing youve said that isnt monkey brained
quite fun
its one of my favpurite maps
mine are reviewed and have a slimish case
also those cases are shitty
yeah but yours arent reviewed and i have patience
sure but its not a choice of model
mine arive a week after urs
what about it
i dont need a different model
that doesnt get sweaty and the maker can say whatever they want. itsd not a choice of model is a choice of it or a nozzle
convenience
i dont want shitpods, no silicone tips
gotta be wireless g
parts for speaker
soundimports.eu/en/dayton-audio-daex32sq-8.html             underfloorheating-direct.com/premium-xps-boards-26380-p.asp
ill probably get both and some parts for a speake rim building
According to the law in England and Wales: "A person commits theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it." ... So if it can be proven that the property that was thrown away had a rightful owner, it would be illegal to take it

again you are using metacritic, a group of subjective people to 'disprove' my subjective opinion
good for you
ok
yes
you tried to undermine my opinion with general opinions which is fucking retarted
where i said i enjoyed it
you still asked a question about perszonal opinions
i find it boring and enejoyable, theres no specific part to it just the idea and execution isnt enjoyable to me
i said i liked it and started sharing subjective reviews created by a small group of people
'anybody' refering to single people
sure but you asked if 'i' liked it
right but thats an opinion, which i dont share
k
not by me
still subjwctivw
yes

There's the i360
Ohhhh
What's the ring in the clouds
Visiting the big black cock
shut the fuck up
jackbox gaaming tonight?
yoo i cn play btd in vr
<@!751492479525847111>  wanna do siome overclocking? 
kk
no type
in  vr
vc
it is
it is
ill loose slight visual quality but i dont use glasses in vr anyways so its already blurred
mb
dunno then
and apparently a 2.0 slot
i was getting 303mb/s
hmmm
mostly
no difference for me
ill jut live with 2.0
ah well
but all the ports are perfroming as usb 2.0
dunno
bruh my usb 3.0 gen 2 is performing like usb 2.0
but thats fairly expenisve , no?
dunno
so all the io pretty much
his audio and usb is fecked
anyone wanna do mc
it can be done
y
nah
i did and it wouldnt have worked
sure
wouldnt have worked
but still
i did
cause no money
couldnt activate it tho
and we couldnt reinstall windows
which i didnt have
right but a ssd would cost money
so your point is
we knew that monthsd ago
yeh
and.....
yeah
dummy
900p vs 1080
and ram doesnt get slower the miore is used afaik
and i was never ram capacity limited
nah without anything open it got 40
used to get 40 on absolute lowest
getting 300+ fps with maxed out settings
yeah
nice
whats that role
my gpu bios doesnt support it but it is there
look in ghwtoos
and applies an offset to voltage up to 100%
but changes power limit and clock
sure
hence the existance of msi afterburner
yeah but gpus can and will overclock
just cpu
either way all the games i play wont max out the gpu
and for the gpu i measured it i dont get much gains other than overclocking the core but i didnt test too extensively
gains above 3600mhz wont be massive but still there
those are both for oc
did you read the article
you can oc them
called 'memory try it!'
using their premade sets
im also going to oc the ram by a bit
mhm
im gonna run the 1usmus clocktuner tonight
i just used 'amd overclocking' as the voltage
12v is fine
thats a first
the thing that broke it was my cpu voltage
so now its all good
i saved the bios profile
yup
nah it was fine
f
just had to clear cmos
do subnotica
bruh
wait
nho mic
also anyone wanna do subnautica multiplayer
but i maxed out fortnite settings at got 75fps
but idk my steam acc so no gaming yet
im on it rn
it works
yes
shesh
alrighty, i sec
0%fan speed
5ghz all cores
<@!751492479525847111>  wanna do some overclocking
I'll @you for help later
And overlcoking ram
I'm gonna try the 1usmus clock tuner
It says UEFI on and ram is fine
It's all good
Nice eggbox
Very clean
<@751492479525847111>  what should ichange in bios while I'm in it
cool
is that for oofi windows
thats what im about to do
havent even looked in the bios yet
and gonna go use it now
just used the windows media creation tool to install windous
10
pog
but itas win10
w11 doesnt support bios anyways
if you have CSM disabled in the bios, it'll install in uefi (edited)
<@!751492479525847111>
pog
just 1 windows
like my dad has????
how do you know then?
honestly ill just find a guide that doesnt call me slurs and explains it insteadf oif telling me im wrong
so the previous guide tells me how to do that
how nice
ah so you're wrong already
its a AMD device
then whats different, and you're saying the company that made the firmware is wrong ?
than whats the magic sauce
and my dad has been doing this for years
im still perfectly capable of following a guide
im perfectly capable

aw dang it was working yesterday
1st world problems fr
cheers for the advice, im off to explore boston
chances of me sticking to a 2nd playthrough are slim. id rather enjoy something subpar than reach for perfection and lose interest
ty <@151169597129752577>  solid advice
you coulda just said, "yeah it edits a lot in your save - next time you start a playthrough remeber to remove it"
right so drop the attitude with "why not just uninstall it", because you agree it probably will fuck shit
if i will fuck shit up by removing it then i wont bother until my next playthrough and just deal with the consequences of my uninformed choices
thats rude. im trying to point out that online advice says "do it and youll fuck shit up" im telling you ive played 50 hours, i have a couple mods that are dependent but i can sort it out, is it safe to remove
but ami better off adding all the patches that are supposed to remove awkcr dependcy?
i dont think i have any awkcr issues
ive already got it üòì
so i can just continue like this for now and fix it on my second time round
or is it like ive already installed awkrc so theres no point trying to undo what cant be undone
should i replace my mods with version that dont use awkcr
should i still install patches?
ah im mid playthrough
that makes my life easier
‚ù§Ô∏è
now dealing with this
i came back to it this morning, and im pretty sure its all sorted ü´°
And for performance, what one thing (pre vis or lod or other) is the best
Is there a particular youtuber or doc to refer to for game optimization
Thank you for the suggestions
Sorry I outta come back to this tomorrow, Im completely knackered- been studying all day and trying to learn this
Sorry to babble, I think what's best is if I finish the game fairly fast on this first play through and then come back wiser and more prepared and mod it right
I get the random crash around sanctuary most often so I generally avoid it but I need the minutemen in my play through now
LOD, Previs, merging/ba2 etc is that stuff really *that* important or is it more for perfectionists
If that's the case, I can restore my old version, re clean all the mods with fo4edit and then I should be good right?
Yeah I'm thinking it's because I made everything into ESL (I'm not sure if that's the right name but I mean the light ones)
Ah missed that, thank you, I'll get that in 5m
i do have the unofficial patch installed and PRP idk why they arent detected
if i cant sort this imma just unzip my old files and deal with occasional crashes/setbacks
please @me as im about to head to bed
i never found out cause the game crashes on launch
i got occasional CTD and figured this could help
following 
mighta wrongly converted some things to ESLs
im stuck
is there a easy way to find the U and V values to set
hiya, im trying to create the colour #715c48 in the metahuman skin colour selector
i wonder of the x,y alignment of the vibrtion motors would change the artifacting
plenty of screw holes, easy wiring, space for a larger motor
what about a larger vibration motor on the bed?
Low cloud cover today
it would burn you very very quickly ü§£
no one called yet üòÖ
alternatively, any 
you can use projector central to check if the projector has the right sort of bulb, youre looking for any UHP/UHB/PVIP bulb. id reccomend 200+W
i got a xtrax pro projector for 3 GBP - it was sold as broken because the image had a line through it but the bulb itself is fine
ive got 6km of throw from this light (calculated to ansi fl1) and 9,200,00 cd
if its elliptical youll need a suitable large fresnel lens
if its a parabolic reflector you wont need any further optics
dsign + print a case
surpisingly little, go to ebay, find a used/broken projector. rip it apart and keep the bulb + cooling + ballast + power supply then make a smoothed + rectified ~350vdc power supply (assuming 240vac); connect all relevant wires and find out how to trick the ballast into turning on (usually just shorting 2 pins) then youre done

Big ass lense
a lot of the bridge is up to interpretation so its hard to show all possible shapes
does that show the criteria well?
Your bridge must have a clear straight path 40mm wide for ‚Äúcars‚Äù to drive on, you can use a total extra 30mm in width for supports and extra features. Height wise you're allowed 80mm and length wise the bridge must be 150mm long with 25mm either side to attach to the table


i can have them install SS with my profile and then have them optimize however they like for 30g?
its not a particularly smart group
using omnshape. plus if they could figure out generative design then theyve earnt it
but if everyone has the same settings then i have the issue of different weights again
yup it is
this is there very first time even using CAD
they wont be slicing anything. i dont trust them and they dont have the knowledge for it
and then 10% infill standard and adjust shells to reach 30g
like 30g
what seems reasonable
that makes more sense
or  weight held / (6 X bridge weight)
would doing weight held / sqrt bridge weight be good
how can i force people into weaker bridge designs or punish bridge weight
im setting up a design challenge for a club. its 3d printed bridges 200mm in length. theres some other rules and stuff to follow but i have a problem. the way scoring works is the weight the bridge can hold divided by the weight of the bridge. with my quick test i had a 60g bridge hold me (60kg). so the bridge is too strong for any significant testing
with enough hours
i could probably design a extender
im rubbish at cad (only been using onshape for maybe a few weeks) , but it didnt take long to pick up
yet üòé
redesign the very top part or maybe an extender?

mb, shouldve explained better. yeah this will be a ring to hold a large fresnel lense so its mostly for rigidity
if id need to do 2 operations then its a easy choice to do threads
is that not a good idea
i was thinking just having the nut on the flat surface
or my local uni
im doing it via jlcpcb
just parts i already have, this is my first time getting something cnc'ed so im just getting a feel for design choices
cheaper
for a one off part, idk itll only be assembled once ever
cool, how come?
the whole thing is easy access
mb its metal cnc
either will work for me but i dont know whats best practice
do i want that hole to be threaded or do i use nuts

Or even a catapult mini v2
Yeah the l21b is 21700 but if you've only got built in charging 18650 lights then you'd be better with the if22
But if you just want a small thrower the if22 from sofirn will be better
More efficient, wider beam etc
The sft40 version is a lot better

AliExpress? Or fast shipping?
Lemme look
AHH alright, 21700 will just have a higher capacity and discharge per volume
But look at the r/flashlight subreddit for battery stores in your country
Depends on your country
Some 21700s would be good p45b or p45a (can't remember which) is good
What's it for?
Do you want high discharge or high capacity
very nice, i guess ill take a look for frames
do the springs on the arms still work?
I'd worry they're not accurate
Have you double checked the lense is correct?

this will be my first ever EDC torch
Vapes are all fine tho?
Ah cool
Especially since bikes belong to a company, vapes are just individuals rubbish
Bikes maybe not
Vapes, yes
Bikes or vapes
And I'm picking up litter, it's a win win. Bikes are a whole other thing tho
I walk through a council estate and a park on my way home, usually see at least 2 a day
Got 14 already and started last week thrusday
I've already started grabbing disposable vapes off the floor to take the battery from
I don't plan on it, but if I'm out and see a scooter I'll consider it
Yeah the Boris bikes here don't always lock right and you can just yank them. A lot of teens stand around the rack and try take them
Morally and legally that is
If I see a broken one would it be wrong to get the battery
lime-bike powered house when?
true
kids steal them or grab them off people and ride around london nearly running over pedestrians
lime scooters arent nice things üíÄ
people abandon them everyone in the city
tbf ive seen people chuck the bikes into the thames river without consequence
nah some dude from the r/flashlights discord
oh well, not my place but i dont understand how people dont see it coming
nop. posted on facebook when he got with a proud photo
like howw are people so unaware
and relied quite heavily on the nhs in the past
in london
my dads friend walks around in a MAGA shirt
Uh oh ü§≠
Two loops of fishing rope?
stops em shaking around
prevents ringing in the belts ü§î
the zip ties on belts?
wait whats the issue?
ah im kidding, its sick, thats one you bought?
not me being upstaged rn
I'm definitely gonna buy a hobbyist grade blue and red emitter now
Found a old zoomie and did a emmitet swap and converted it to 18650s
what a day!!
i think theyre in this server
ive got this week off and itd be the perfect chance
i so anxious to build one
yeah they really wanted to release a full version i think
yeah thast what i though too, ive dm'ed the creator to try get early access
i didnt even see the spider til you pointed it out jahahah
so it would just be the time and maybe ¬£50 for random bits and bobs
ive got all the spares i need to build it i think
nice nice
im considering building the voron 0 version or the default rook
how do you like it?
<@722132072289927329> did you build a rook?
AI gifs are too much fun
i reckon its the chest
wasnt me lmao
jarvis, scratch me behind my ears
android app too
parcelsapp
Prolly a multi stage gearbox? Idk
Idk what would be best
I was thinking a worm gear
And a abrasive test would be a linear actuator on a ballscrew to change the pressure on the bungee
Cool, also would a spinning drum work (like spooling filament but a bungee cord) to test strength, just using a load cell connected to the non spooling side
Or is the strain guage the electric stuffs on the metal S
Is a strain gauge not the big S shaped metal thing
id love if someone took a look and let me know if it was any good
hi, im practicing for an upcoming exam, this is my answer to q3 (just one of 3 solutions) 
then end with getting some more single frames in colour like in this
and getting a more dynamic camera, something that looks 3d
i think next thing to try is getting a more stable image, like a city that just changes shape over the song
ended up cutting that video section
one of my prompts, i wanted it to end with a talking face but it wasnt very good
the prompts for that werre about outer space, worms, industrial pipes and a galaxy
ive got no clue what images to put into the videos
BUT
better!
ive done it again
Just get a 2nd pair of hands
Not a fun time, but it works
They are a huge pain tho, I made a frame with them
And now he just makes conspiracy videos
Eh he used to be alright, with the high temp printer and DIY prusa alternatives
Nah they're real
also, hows the first pic look for a pfp?
30k lumens
but its a proper wall of light
new torch, photos dont do it justics
ü§£  i gotta figure out those animations
final ultra upscaled image
from original txt2img ---> outpainting ---> inpainting
AI image workflow
good stuff at 1:10
pople are so talented
gah damn
Dang those are sick
its glow in the dark
peanut butter also glows which is neat
nah nah the lithium grease i use glows, i can see exactly where theres dry spots or see what components need regreasing, its the only use i actually have for this light
huh
Dang that's sick
Nah they small
lots of random hand prints on the ceiling
alo
mhm
uh huh
weirsdly they form large splats of dust
mostly
just dust
hey its actually not bad
Any polcycarb with do with plain ol UVA so I'm using the guadiest sun glasses available
Lmk if any image is unclear
Photos barely capture the details
Got a high power UV torch today and everything is so interesting in UV
Some of my favourite UV images
its too good
same as curas newest tree supports
they have some coming early 2023
thats weird for high torques
loose grub screw by any chance
motor or belt?
Ahh I see, which is the 24gb on one card then
11gb?
I'm looking at the M40 for that sweet sweet 24gb
Ooh nice 12gb vram
Stable diffusion and dreambooth
Or train the ai on yourself and do it perfectly at any angle
Yeah pretty much, word is pretty good for doing non famous people replacements. U can use the remove background tool and copy past onto IMG and AI to clean up
in theory
that should be easy
just send the face you want and the painting
yeah
like take my face and stick it on a old painting
if youve got a paint.exe rough sketch  (nothing magic, just get the colour down) that would help a lot
u thinking a golden gate bridge type thing with hell and heaven on the sides
ill try it out, got dinner first though

*there are two impostors among us*
this pig has NOT had a good career
accurate historical artifiact
sheeesh
sounds fun, i get a extra month holiday after my exams this year. im thinking of getting a short internship then
oh nice, how old are you?
whats co-op?
its sick. it remebers stuff from conversation. so i dont need to keep creating a new pompt. it properly runs like a convo
and this is the free one. you could prolly feed the paid version your articles from your website and have it write in the same style
someone made a klipper config with it
its crazy good
yupp. i gave it my anecdote and a short sentence then generated 2 articles. combined them
i write maybe 3 sentences and it turned them into this
ooowh shit, using chatgpt to help apply for a scholarship. and this thing is goood
Q: Why have you chosen mechanical engineering?
A: I find it satisfying to design and build mechanical systems that solve real-world problems, the process of iterating and improving on functionality and form is satisfying. I enjoy the hands-on work and the feeling of accomplishment when I see my designs come to life. I am also drawn to the versatility of mechanical engineering. Overall, I chose mechanical engineering because it offers a unique combination of creativity, problem-solving, and hands-on work that I find highly rewarding.

Q: Why do you want to be an engineer? What inspired you?
A: As a child, I gravitated to science and the search for answers. I loved learning about how the world around me worked, and I spent many nights being read non-fiction books. This passion for understanding and problem-solving is what led me to engineering. I am particularly interested in the way that engineering allows me to delve into the inner workings of everyday objects, from simple toys to complex machinery. I am excited to continue my exploration of the world through engineering.
this is magical
aiming for 350W
just gave it a short peice of research and told it to write the conclusion
welp
yeah this is only gpt3 imagine what gpt4 or 5 will be capable of
sadge
it just removed the file extension
tried having it make a bat file to remove brackets from file names in a folder
well, it does work 100% of the time
that could solve a lot of barriers to entry
ill try that in a sec
then have it write entire new configs in the same way
you could tell it this part is for this component and this line for this setup etc
and it remebers what you twell it
owh shiiiit it knows klipper
who knows???????????? its a running joke from photoshop class between me and my friend ü§£
its not great, i dont know how to better format the pictures. but nothing here was made by a human, the images were prompted by chatgpt and generated by stable diffusion. the html written and tailored by asking chatgpt to change it. download all 4 to see the final effect
what a day
AND 18 per month 250mbps internet
they're offering free fiber optic upgrade for entire road/house
had some internet lads show up
talk about timing
ooooh
ack
ouch
tho our road needs to be redone on fiber, stuck on copper rn
we get 50 up down for 20 a mnth
bruh where
np, did you have any roles?
prompt: your mom last night
Vzbot AI edition
Kinda yeah
you alright?
how come?
ah dw
i figured out those NeRFs i was talking about
more AI
u wanna have ur mind blown
<@140187416374935552>
@bulb]
did a lil upscale for these all, 4096 minimum resolution (some are wider and some are 1:1)
any want a colourful dystopia
I wish I knew ü§£. But it'll be soon. Considering stable diffusion has only been out a few months
I don't fully understand NeRFs but imma make some next month when I'm on holiday
You can recreate in full 3d any space using a video
And if you feel like exploring jt, Nvidia released their NeRF for public use
But it's miles ahead what I'd do manually
It's okay isb
Nvidia just released a AI that does stl and colour mesh creation
me and my friends last week
obviously
this is me
i made 20 and picked some of the prettier ones. the AI doesnt like "xyz made of abc" but it can change the texture or material of anything
lets find out
me neither, its just crazy fun
nah nah, matthew fist fighting a bear, 8 pack of abs
nah a lot of it looks really perfect. and you can cherry pick resultd
i gotta get some photos of myself together and start flexing on insta
i know some people use it for their tinder
yup, adobe even encourages it to be used for their stock images
but its bedtime, if youve got any questions feel free to ask (and requests) and ill do my best
i use a open source one called stable diffusion
i can walk you though the install tommorow
ive got family from both
got anything american or british
hitler on a motorbike
u got anything?
berlin wall?
one second
yeah just give it a theme and use the colour set
yeah it really nails the vibe of every image every time
top left image looks like the oceans collapsing on itself
i think it went for a lockdown era city more than empty of buildings
gimme some absract idea
ikr, my mind is blown
and i trun them into paragraphs that get some reallly good gens
my inputs for the first AI are all simple sentences, less than 10 words
ive got an AI to write prompts for the AI
<@140187416374935552> wanna see something crazy
upscaled from 512x512 to 8192x8192
<@751492479525847111>
talk about wrong crowd üò¨
<@903656218831228928> chowza
really
How're you boys looking this year
did you do it right]
weird
i put my question (if i can get woodfil) in the comments of the form and they sent wood
not super responsive on discord
yeah you just fill in the link
Cool, that's what I thought
does it increase?
what happens to the power at the psu when the 2 switches close
I'll bring it up TMRW
Yeh Imgur would be wise
whats rook, is that the 3d printed one?
ai
nah the second is
original 512x512
super high res img
kinda both. these are 512x512 pixels. thats what the AI is trained on and works best with. but theres upsclaers that can add detail. ne sec
/ viewbuild id:.
I think
Theres /showbuild
Cool, it's a wonderful tool. I'm happy to help anyone get it setup
Otherwise the docs are quite good as a starter
I'm a smidge busy now, I can VC later and walk through the install with you though
Oh sick. What's the camera? I don't know much about photography but that photo looks sick
Nah ignore 2.0 for now. It's not well supported. Look for automatic1111
Same same. You can do all the AI stuff except dreambooth training locally then (kaggle is fine for that tho)
What GPU do you have
I don't know of one specific video. But I can walk you through it in vc at some point. Aitrepreneur and nerdy rodent on YouTube are quite good
My ones? Yeah I trained the AI on monsters and made those images
Damn that's nice
Checkpoint file. It tells the AI how to generate images
I gotta try add a background to that mushroom one
Cool
someone mind havibng a look at some images and letting me know what they think
i made a .ckpt for stable diffusion, its a work of love so im quite biased towqards it
Thinking of replacing the calculator body as well as the cover
What two filament colours pair nicely with a light wood colour
It's in general? I think. It's covered in air pockets. Looks like a bad application or dust/water
What's the best strategy for alix coins
Spose you could spray wd40 contact cleaner in thrre
Ah that's easy enough
I'm still rocking a office mouse from 9 year's ago
Ooph that's pretty old
Hahaha <@287357528780570625> how old is yours
he kinda looks like me ü§£
shivered
my timbers,
id buy not expecting better than a lenovo office mouse for functionality. but getting a nicer aesthetic
hrm
"AttentionThis is not a Logitech mouse, do not look at the wrong."
<:sheesh:927939329060388894>
meant the linear rails sorry, will keep the z the same
might use some spares to remix it for mgn12h
ill show u inb a sec
wont read out past text unfortanutely
so you can @ people to get them to view the channel
tts will read to anyone viewing th channel
try it
i think so
especially if they use speakers and no noise cancelling in online lessons
then begin the spam
yupp, @someone during online lessons so they open it and leave the channel open

Mmmmm bakon
does it work if i do it from pc
ouch
have a perfect circle burnt into my finger
ive got a tendency to stick my pinky out (not on purpose) and i was working on the hotend while it was heated and went to grab some ooze and forgot my pinky was far above my hand
did it work
or is it app specifically
i gotta start using the mobile sit
dang
wait actually
all good
and thats considered dim, although considering its size its bright
oh Every Day Carry
ts10, 1500 lumens, 14500 battery
hows a EDC torch sound
may as well try it, can always open a dispute. orange pi is fairly cheap
Nah it's my friends pc (very believable innit)
and 41 alerts from malwarebytes

ooooooh
sheeesh

No processing on the video
Lep  indoors
Oh cool
Try the search bar, pretty sure someone was successful
Can't remember who
Agh someone here runs it on a TV box
any linux machine will work iirc
im really hoping to pic up the thor 1 to EDC, its smaller than my hand and goes 1.5km üò©
and id love a soda can sized 12k lumen light
that list i sent has: blue lights, UV lights and a LEP module (with a good lens can do ~3km)
havent even got into expenive lights yet
i gotta send my more recent pics here soon
big lumen
from what ive heard theyre smooth and affordable
i dont have a UV, blue or 8k+ lumen light yet. im hoping to pick up a: aliexpress.com/item/32873025585.html?mp=1, aliexpress.com/item/1005003764674239.html?mp=1 and a 8k+ lumen light. im thinking a quad sbt90.2 set up or just cree xhp70.3
i shine them at the sky and go, ''ooh so pretty''
ill have 2.5 months off school soon so i wanna be ready for then
i gotta check with vez whats in the kit tho, if the parts arent really what i want or its too expensive i may skip it
i might say fuck it and buy a full kit plus a couple new flashlights (potentially a LEP module to diy with)
what items are you guys picking for th sale?
what brusli said,i use it around sails to check for artificial price increases
use alitools to make sure its actually a price decrease
wow! so serene
i found one of my adapters was broken and killed every microsd i tried to format with it
have you killed a lot of microsd's?
otherwise aldi might still be selling that organizer
fishing tackle box?
and the most important are hold to my table with magnets
remember those covid test boxes, i kept the little baggies and stored all my screws in there
more forg
that measurement is sick
ah much moer than my phone cost tho
spose it okay for a few uses tho
hm, thats unfortanute
my macro cam cries if i get any closer than a few cm
<:sheesh:927939329060388894>
what camera are you using for your pics <@448202437808095232>
mmmm
tryna find a photo my friend sent me a while back, they made a "diy 2mm nozzle"
ty ty
made with ai ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

me waiting for the laugh to kick in
its the easiest gcse, and i had to do a language üò¢
<:sadge:1004524978240229386>
ah try latin for useless
and the printed bed spacers have long melted
the surface is so old it has holes in from probing at temp so often
just not trammed
yeah its fairly flat

lmao, my friend got searched by a teacher
RIP bed
this is a photo of the plunger, not sure if the catch is pronounced enough
it could be 3 things i think, im using a retal spring, the catch spring is fairly weak, the cach isnt vvery big
having some difficulty getting my firestrike to catch
anyone here expeirienced with modding nerf guns]
think its fixed
try again
owh damn, thats sick. is that at a job or a at home machine?
im sure the same can be acheived with a nema 14 or just a remote extruder esque design
is that you?
why?????????
Oh nice, one of my friends is really into truck Sims, bit of a different gameplay but sameish idea
Damn that's sick, do they still use wide monitors or do people use vr now
Hahaha ive done that before. That actually put me down the path to vzbot
Damn that's sick
ah, well theres always a v2
honestly not sure 
less motors, more flight?
may as well go vtol then, no?
i wonder if vtols can move slowly instead of flight OR hover
is this gonna be autonomous?
would a vtol airplane not be better suited?
ah, at that point, may as well stick a gimbal on then
h no, youd probably want the drone to be stuper lightweight
battery range maybe a li-ion battery pack would be good
*gimbal
Well you can buy or make controllable tripod things for directional antennas that give you more range
Cya
Yeah
Nearly 2 am
Same
Yupp I'll be getting a friend to double triple check mine
I've avoided high voltages so far
Damnnn
What accidents have you had
Same, I had a fet properly explode once, and a skr v1.4 catch fire momentarily and now I double check polarity
I just love how smart every one is on the server. It's both humbling and awe-inspiring
Half this server goes right over my head
Much more than what I can do
Oh wow that's sick
What job do you have if you don't mind me asking
You guys ever dabble in RC airplanes?
same, get home, headphones on and they stay on
its doable, baaarely
hahah that intro
yeah its the only game i let myself be competitive in (last beatsaber thing i promise) 
lemme show you insanity
you ever heard of the challenge mappers on beatsaber
yeah those are the asbolute fastest i can manage
easiest judge is to mimic playing along as th song goes
absolutely wrecks my shoulders
i can show you some of the harder songs ive played? but something insane for my freind (tech mapping) is easy to me but speed songs are harder to me but theyre pretty good at it
i have 0 hand eye coordiation. so its been pretty difficult
funny guy
but im back on the grind
yeah felll out of practice this summer
its certainly not the hardest song ive seen, but thats fairly difficult
ill say beatsaber videos give you a false sense of difficulty
yeah, all preference, i like walking to the beat. nice peaceful moment where i dont need to think and can just relax before school
i could imagine them all, if mapped right
first one prolly to actually
last one definitely
not bad tho
that sounds like something id play in beatsaber
these are a coiple of my favourites
rare americans has the top spot in my playlist for ages
nothing close to what you like, i quite like putting on rare americans in the mornings while i walk
just finished up a game of among us with friends
finally googled how to pronounce guillaume. thought it was guy-lam-ee             turns out it gee-y-ohm (kinda)
/s
how do u pronounce mad bull. is it madbu el
hm true, ill keep server profie but change username to ruckusmatter
username godisdead is dead üòé
i used to use ruckusmattster on xbox. bit un pronounceable name tho
oh yea mme change username
Yeah ill go for "Matthew üòé"
Yeah plus can't boast to the extended fam without sheepishly saying "that's me"
I'm thinking just my first name, or a play on my first name
You guys got any good ideas
It's a bit of a political statement that I'm not qualified to discuss and not one I'm particularly proud to go running around with
Thinking of changing my name
modern art
hows the bind port work
wait
huh my receiver only powers on if the signal, ground and positive are plugged into the batt/bind port
battery is at least another 90
<:sadge:1004524978240229386>
without battery
my airplane weighs exactly 250g
Iirc just under a year. Lemme check
yeah one of the old mods here dissapeared, always wonder if they grew apart from the hobby or lost their account or worse
ohhhh
those are the only rc car guys i know
or the one with the monster truck
the rocket engine one?
ill get permission from some local farms i guess to fly above
yeah ill have to figure that all out, and only fly around fields
and one teeny sub 250g autonomous wing
i just wanna make one laaarge lion powered autonomous drone wide wing slow flying
ill get second hand
maybe
üò©
so imma blow it on a low end vzbot or fpv
get 600 quid for doing engineering stuff
im applying for a scholarship thingy
ez pz, just dont buy house and be young  enough to live with parents <:wesmart:890660011531989072>
maybe if i get some more moolah ill get a nice receiver and proper fpv kit
but for now im okay with low range. only fly line of sight after all
ill try return
i guess
oh man thats good
new
sorry im really nwe
whats spekrtum?
idk
maybe i try return it
bruhhhh üò¢
ive binded to one of these ^ before
thats üòç
at least frsky is still compatible with ardupilot
oh well
man, buyers remorse hitting hard rn
cheaper receivers?
or whats it good for
whats elrs?
yeah think so
<:kekw:906674564879233024>
<:sadge:1004524978240229386>
yeah i bought the tx12 about a week before tx12 mark two was announced]
cool, thank you. do you know the difference between the tx12 mk2 and tx12
yeah, dunno which receiver
thankfully i can borrow a receiver for the weekend or until a new one arrives
noe i gotta figure out what receiver to pair with my tx12
but it seems it arrived pre broken
yeah ive been told. this plane is m first, acting as a trainer so im not too concerned with it getting broken
almost finished building the flitetest f22
yeah, bought a plane second hand to reuse the electronics
Looks broken <:sadge:1004524978240229386>
i cant get mine to power on
also, how can i test to see if a receiver is dead
see
randomly
but
we're just tagging people
no no
does that help
heres a quick summary
<@287357528780570625>
howd you find it
gah damn
but its t slot
yeah i tried that on google, cant find anything identical. but similar looking
u profile? but fancy?
woops i just assumed they were wired , whats the wires for then?
isnt that a wired headset?
whats the battery add?
shows his investment strats
btc go down
air fryer go up
is clear
he re sells stuff on the side
heres a graph to demonstrate his opinion on crypto and airfryers
my friend is re selling air fryers
i cant find a pack of 8060 proppellers with a 5.8 ( i think) bore
just the cheapest available while im learning
nothing fancy
could someone help me find a prop for my rc plane
Oh yeh. They show up a week or two before school starts again
Mine are in 6 months
It takes 3 months
U just gotta revise all of yr 10/11
They aren't that bad
Oh I seee
What stage of school?
We have a big end exam when we turn 16 thats for our grades
At the end of every unit we do a test. They don't contribute to our grade tho
Every class in the UK has tests
Kek
Politics kinda. More of a focus on urban Vs rural and globalisation (at least in the UK)
Hmmmm
But as a nation
The people are nice for the most part
Numbers say otherwise
Um
There's a few iffy spots but to a much lesser degree than america
Even in central London people are very friendly
Even the dodgy lot are friendly
Have u ever visited the privaleged subburbs of london
hmmmmmm
you ate play doh as a child? its all starting to make sense
wizz in them <:thonk:906671607232200756>
Makes 1 coloured ball
Prep 10 minutes

You will need

8 tbsp plain flour
2 tbsp table salt
60ml warm water
food colouring
1 tbsp vegetable oil
Method

1. Mix the flour and salt in a large bowl. In a separate bowl mix together the water, a few drops of food colouring and the oil.

2. Pour the coloured water into the flour mix and bring together with a spoon.

3. Dust a work surface with a little flour and turn out the dough. Knead together for a few minutes to form a smooth, pliable dough. If you want a more intense colour you can work in a few extra drops of food colouring.

4. Store in a plastic sandwich bag (squeeze out the air) in the fridge to keep it fresh
gelatin is pretty much infinitely useable tho
its very easy to diy and pretty cheap so i wouldnt sweat it. but you can prolong its life in a sealed container
if its the one on the left idk. but if its the one on the right you could cast it in gelatin
i see, diy play doh?
got a photo?
one sec
wouldnt one of those gauges be better
clay?
yes
thats the thor 3
yupppp
the most intense is only 400 lumens but very concentrated. but my other light is 2000 lumens but suuuper wide so its a dim but even beam going almost 180 degrees
intense or brightest?
depends
well
ive only got 4 lights tho
a smidge
Those blueish bars are the light beams which are visible irl and the lit up spot is the hotspot on the light
The first photo is a l21b on the right and a Thor 3 on the left
Took my new Thor 3 out today

PE followed by double english
theres a couple other
yeah its a ''bug'' with discord
we start on the 6th
A levels?
ive got doubleü§¢ latin ü§¢  twice a week
ugh lucky
PE first period every week monday üò¢
hey <@173827530929733632> ! no talking for me
we can add midjounrey to this server, lemme jst check with the admins
Oh, that sucks. I was gonna say for a organic shape you could use meshmixer, but its a user mod, so not gonna be so organic. Is it a printer frame STL?
What's the model?
It's so fancy
We got upgraded to club world????
I have a bad idea
Hm ü§î
A friend, it doesn't feel like that many tho
Hmmm
Weird
Maybe I was behind on updates
Doesn't run too well on my phone
I dont like it
Has discord mobile changed the ui
I've always found it interesting
Yeah one of my old teachers presented it to me
So I just have to remember to pick up the phone
One has my number on tho
All the ones I launched we lost. The wind was a wee bit strong
Engines are surprisingly the cheap part
When I'm back in the UK imma try those
I'm on holiday rn, so gotta make do
But it fell apart mid air
Videos a little meh
From leftover actual rockets
Jank ass mini rocket
That's why we get crazy volumetric flow from a straight bore 1.8 It runs straight through so it's just motor speed limits. Filament won't actually melt tho
Not bad
Just got on a flight. They offer free internet for 30m if u watch a 13s ad
U in the UK?
But so damn cool
*not me
I gotta watch em all
Didn't know CNC bloopers were a thing
Idk, just saw someone on annex post it
Shed fun
After painting
Before painting (bleached and nasty)
Looks pretty good
Painted my shed today
the c8+ is more pocketable with a wider beam and less throw but is much more practical
theres better lights out there tho for throw, this is a budget light
definitely not coincedence
its happened 7 times in 3 days
it sets off my car alarm
and fun story
so i got my tx12 in the mail this week
So I gotta get a job first
But those are much more expensive
Next on my purchase list is a lep (maxtoch l3k) or lumen monster (x75 or ms018)
And it's only 30 quid
FUN!
The torch is a l21b with culpm emitter from convoy on AliExpress
And a block of flats roughly 1km away
Lit up a target 650m away
Took the torch out for some fun
4
Well I put 51x2460x60 instead of 51x24x60x60
Eh
Wait that equation is wrong
hm
i got half a mb per second
(3.6e+6)/(51x2460x60)
Rip
4 in literature
9 in language
Got my English mocks back
Fixed by yours truly and hand delivered back to my friend
Bought for 50 quid
It came from an abusive home
worth it
i got a small desk fan for school. everyone and their grandma asks if its on right before trying to grab it by the blades while its spinning
pardon?
if i want the printer intact? no. i think your idea of additive vs subrtractive is gonna be easiest for people to understand and allows my friends to ask about my expeirience with them. and that ticks most of the assesment criteria
just stand awkwardly nexct to the printer
10 minute talk waiting for the printer to heat up
i think ill do additive vs subtractive. less abstract ideas. its glue gun on a robot vs drill on a robot
my friend brought their ender into school
well
nah ive got nothing machined in my house which uis a shame
im 50/50 on that or a basic intro to 3d printing
that was my worry. i care about this subject. a room of teens on a hot friday afternoon couldnt care enough to heckle me
you know what. thats probably much easier
i've no hands on experience with delta printers. so if i were to focus on the motion sysrtem i figured it was best to do something i know well
to  a class of 15 year olds
i gotta do a speaking exam for school
what would be moer interesting. a 5-10 minute talk about:
 the vzbot vs inverted delta 
 cartesian kinematics vs corexy
Join me in a drink fellow humans ü§ñ
not powered, just short the coils on the stepper. it adds a lot of resistance
ah. big budget stuff. then forget about vslot. a stepper with its coils shorted and a ballscrew will be perfect i think
if its just on blocks youll have to be very careful to mount them level or itll slide to the lowest side. personally, id opt for vslot wheels or alike since theyre cheap and easy to mount
although it runs into power issues there, so leave it at 90% power limit and 1970mhz
my gpu runs at 2.08ghz
whats the base clock
check out gn for a proper exlanation
one of their psu's exploded
It's just for a speaking exam, 10 minutes max including time for questions
dunno if i got lucky or smthing with the timing but thats better than amazons offering in price and shipping
less than 12hours later
got a package from rapidrc that i ordered last night
and skwanzie and jessek i think
woohoo. i know rudra is also 16-17
16 in 3 months
gcse maths mocks
It was all very easy
But
Nothing I practiced came up
Just finished the math test I was practicing for
you make -2x=0.5x+10 to find where they cross. (x=-4)
then substitute  x=-4 into y=-2x to find y=8. from there the equation of the the circle is 8^2+4^2=r^2 
solve all that to get a final of 80=r^2
ive found the equation of the tangent is y=0.5x+10
i slipped and cut myself with a spatula
Lol
Damn it's huuuge
Then I took a second look
For a second I though you were holding closer to the camera than the printer
Hey! Internet is back
Oh rip. Hard to understand over text
I don't think it's glue stick. Too clear. Sugar syrup or alike maybe? I dunno ive no experience with chocolate printers
But can it speedboat ü§î
Our router took a dump and refuses to work. 2 days before my exams start. It's like the router tries to break at the worst time
kek
and filled his printer with sand instead of input shaper
dude built a 2x2x2m frame instead of inout shaper
also how do you charge these batteries?
heheheheheheh
we arent ?????????
just did

<#859133490041454592> here i come
yup
visited the US and built a small pressure bomb for shits and giggles for a couple dollars
have to have aq licences last i checked
it just sublimates after a day
you can get dry ice for less than milk at walmart
Same, had that black square crack in half and shatter
eh, needs to pull itself up by the bootstraps
Makes for a fun read
And some of the concept printers are just wacky
Some of the older hotends resemble the mosquito and clones which is cool
Nothing modern that I know of though
Some is still relevant nowadays
Reprap forum had a wiki of the older printers and parts
The working remote only flashes when the button is pressed
I guess so. Can't find anything else wrong. The LED flashes non-stop
Empty
its a suden change
shorted on purpose, the traces just end nowhere
Our ceiling light remote broke. First PCB is from a broken one, second is working. Anyone see something wrong. I'm at a loss
same, except i get ~5 months! ill be building a full fat vzbot in exactly a year from now
most of it will apply though , no?
hey <@448202437808095232> when you get that guide out we can add it to announcements along with vez's build of the vz235. i think itll be a great tool for builders to use/follow
5 of them
Jellyfish
Kiiiiiids the snacks are ready
I kept it on low around them mostly. Put it on high to get their attention
And I've got my flashlight
There's some small people's playing hide and seek outside
Ours was much more expensive

First time on Ryanair and there's a 1hr delay
RIP
Too late now, left his house, next time I'm there I'll take a look
And layer times is set super low
Complete identical square
And it repeats that same pattern through the entire print
Oh well
Yeah, we did enable that beta corner feature but that's the only weird thing
Settings are
Setting up my friends slicer profile and he says the infill is printing at different speeds. Superslicer shows this in layer view
Wow that looks beautiful, I'm loving that open look
first or second position. for a battery powered desk fan
discord amolded mode
Bruh. The tiles are all wonky in the middle
I was at the end of the Piccadilly line,
No, what happened?
Ah British tube stations. 3 guys drinking, 15 minutes til the next train and the service announcement keeps assuring me there's great service on this line
I tried with a transparent petg it just ended up really milky and white
Nice, I'll see how everyone likes it, I might try to make a clear lid from a PC sheet
That dual tone looks fantastic
Oh NVM you already added 4
I'll add that later today, brought mine to school today, most of the feedback was that there was no feeling if tactility only the sound
Nice, looks pretty good, is that a separate room for the printers?
Ah cool
How do you get that to show up, is it aa program running on a PC
lel
<@329284552243544065>
Sure, one sec
just assembled, its MUCH louder, print in pla
i just didnt like the printed screw, plus inserts are for certified cool people üòé
Ah I'll send the stl in a sec, test printing now
remixed with a space for a m3 insert and screw hole and a slightly longer spring for a bit more click, havent tested the latest version but it *should * work
well feel free to spam in <#857878337703247872> it shouldnt give people a popup notif
yay ü•≥
weird
might need to restart discord
pretty neat. i like it
anyone on desktop seen partymode for discord
I'll slice it and set it off
Perfect
No sound rn, is it loud?
anyone got some fun small prints
If zoomies are what you love the convoy z1 us always an option. But at the end of the day, if your torch is good enough there's no point upgrading
just got a 95cri light with 4 LEDs and 2000lm output. it pairs nicely with my 90cri thrower with 1.4km of throw. i barely underdstand the more complex ideas but i do love playing with torches
so many cool and expensive lights
that lights CRI isnt fantastic. if youve got a lot of money to spare id reccomend checking out r/flashlight
ah that makes sense, foxes are the biggest uk animal and all they do is piss on the tent and scream at you. plus the scout campsites we slept at are protected. fair enoug then for the sleeping in the dark
im not fond of the dark but the torches genuinely make it fun. theres better lights thatn the ones i named but those two are solid budget choices
i had a S21D with me and a L21B. the first has a wide spread and lights everything in front of you and the second is wonderful for long range
if the dark is the problem, spending on a proper torch is worth it. i brought 2 lights that made everything easy
ah oke
cool, any tips for sleeping in the tents. freezing before bed found it got really warm and stuffy over night
welp i do have a change of socks for every day
and i guess wipe off with a dry wipe before sleeping
so you just rub it on under clothes in a thick layer or just a thin layer?
oh back of my leg got chafed a little. i can put on there?
or legs and bits
for feet?
thanks for the help
yeah, so fish and a fork will be easy. and ill put blister plasters on preemptively were i got blisters this time
im not sure if theres anything else i need, we tried cooking but it was a disaster so i figured canned fish will be quick and easy
ended up refilling ~3 times a day
with refill, english countryside is full of pubs so we just stopped at every one we saw
does this sound okay for the hike: one change of clothes, 6 cans of fish, chocolates, beef jerky, flashlight, sleeping bag and inflatable pillow, first aid kit, water bladder 2L
gotta do the hike a 2nd time, im packing much lighter for that one
doing the duke of edinburgh silver hike
nah, nothing special
it was all very flat apart from one hill that was maybe 50m high. no exact numbers unfortunately
dont have to backtrack if you cant follow the route and shoot off to the west on day 2 <:wesmart:890660011531989072>
as in how steep was it or how high above see level?
at the end of the day tho, it wasnt awful. 11 of us total
we managed to turn our 20km planned route into 30km
this isnt the exact route but its fairly close to this. most of it was through farms
oh rip thats my first hike ever
fairly heavy bag but i dont know any exact weights
70km over 3 days
idk man, maybe its my shoes but my feet are more blister than feet
*everything * aches
i dont know how people enjoy hiking
ill send you 12 bucks and a nft a friend gave me as a "gift". then you gift me a 3090?

whys windows banned?
ü§§  thats my dream VR pc
the zerog corexy conversion is designed in onshape, i think they use it for collaborating easier
for the gear generation i just go to openscad, or you can manually do it
i wouldnt mind that tbh, but im not sure what they would add
being able to manipulate a 3d object and see how its changing insted  of a 2d drawing really helps me
dunno if proper CAD has that
yup, and i quite like the centering feature
regroup
change
ungroup
its slightly off and doesnt sit right
but
brother wants a simple hook, easy, designed in 5 minutes
yup, without it most of my designs would have fallen apart
you can change anything without it impacting something further down the timeline
i quite like tinkercad for objects that need lots of simple iterations
sharp edge on the spoon
neat
RIP I hit 68c under load. Which GPU do you have?
Well at least glass dust is fun to breathe üòÇ
It's just not a looker. Water-cooling is what I'd get if I had more money. Always liked the look
From my seat I measured 41dba under 100% load
I'm quite happy with my setup, it's pretty barebones and the PSU leaves quite a bit to be desired but performance is great
Or kiauh
Just look at kiuah for help
üòã
did you see the full video
needed a lil something to mix it up
yeah, didnt like the consistent look of the panel

rift is wired tho, no?
not sure if anyone here knows
My oculus quest airlink connection is stuck at 20-30mbps
I've tried everything I can think of
Cable isn't the bottleneck
Router shouldnt be
Ports arent
Settings in oculus arent
Drivers are up to date
Using a BT home hub 4 (not connected to internet) and a quest 1
Forced 5ghz
On my home network I get 56 or so mbps
if it lives through that ill be fine
ill turn it on for 10m outside and put on safety goggles
so grab a random rsistor, 3 batteries and wire in parralel to get high current rating then connect to LED. cool
i can just touch the wires together to power on
can i add a 2 more battery (identical) in parralel and just put a wire directly to the led and skip the switch
minus wires
heres what i hope for it to look like
this makes my head hurt
yeah naw
ive got one 30A battery but its for soemthing else
the Li-ion CAN DO 3a max
an 18650 LI-ION
one more question. would using some alkaline cells (2 aa) be better
lemme find the switch resistance
so ill just calculate with the lowest number for V so that i get the minimum value
another issue, the battery changes voltage right. from 4.2 to 3.3 over its runtime
oh boy
so im gonna direct drive the led (a P70 knockoff)
the battery can handle 3A  max
its for a LED that can handle 5A max, but the switch im using can handle 2A max so im adding a resistor to limit current
someone mind checking this logic is sound
i=vr
2=3.3xR
2/3.3=R
R=0.606
safety value 0.8x0.606= 0.5ohm
probably a short on the case, although im not sure since it took a couple seconds before catxhing fire
Yikes
Nah just visiting for a week during the holidays <@287357528780570625>
Got rid of the first two but can't find the lizard anymore
Nearly stood on a cockroach, centipede and now a lizard
I dont like Florida anymore
And had a tongue
I wish, it was yellow/cream and white
We also saw a snake once maybe a foot or two long
We see a lot of millipedes here but they are never bigger than my index finger
Found a cockroach a few minutes before this. Usually the house is very clean, just a coincidence I guess
There's a short video
Ignore the talking
Looking back it's closer to 8 inches. So tbh it has a good chance of beating that lizard
Hopefully he gets eaten
Took him out and threw him at a large lizard
Nearly stood barefoot on this guy. 6 or more inches long ü§Æü§¢
üêí<------DPT
Went for a dip
Platter for making a large layered mirror
Magnets for a tool mount
Motor for messing around with
Bldc motor, magnets and platter
Yummy
Got a light snack
What were the exams on
it qouls be enough for a ender 3 or other simple lower speed printers
kinda, for the first week of my pair they hurt like hell, and they definitely apply pressure. after a while your teeth stop shifting and it stops hurting, but for a month or two you can feel it tugging
so it might be different
although ive had my braces off already
ive got no plastic nobs, but you can definitely feel it tugging
I've got a scan of my teeth which is neat
I'd hope he has /some/ dentist training
yeah its news, same way we get <#833394471457521694>  from following other big servers
no way to know
*over 28 days
yep
I can get those numbers again when I'm back at my computer, I'll be a hour or so roughly
Right???
The harder the artery the more stab proof it is
simple, quick and good for fidgeting
so much fun
Tbf it was probably the old PC giving it issues
I used to use better discord but it started giving me issues so I just left it off my new pc
EHEHEHEHEHE
and rn im thinking about your motors <@!448202437808095232>
its the thought that counts
Even after this crap ass solder
At least they offered to pay
just wanted to check, cause 15f would be pretty knarly
damn, lucky
15 c or f
My friends keep bringing me wires and plugs and bits to solder and crimp cause they don't have a soldering iron or a crimoer
Hehehehe
Now I'm trying to use the HDD as a ESC
And I held a ~3000 lumen light behind it And couldn't see it through the disk
I gave it a solid whack and it didn't break so I am confident it's not a glass disk
My pencil sharpener is broken, should I splurge for the 1tb model next time
Spinny mogus
Printing out the teeth as soon as I get home
It had one weird artifact which they didn't clean up unfortunately but otherwise it even picked up the tiny chip in my front tooth
The scan super good
Also got the 3d scan of my mouth
Got a new mouth retainer and noticed the layer lines were really visible
Can I have one
<:sheesh:927939329060388894>

At least you'll get better internet speed with that 5g chip eh     /s
I've got all my games on a 2tb barracuda 7200rpm HDD from a PC on the side of the road
Does fancy storage matter that much
thats fhesse97  i think
and the plot just thickens
found a better comparison
just looked at google images tbh
the vez photo is from his ''hi im vez'' livestream
vez just gona reply with a ''<:mildpanic:906671521647448124> ''
got anything you wanna tell us
hmmmmmmm
especially with school starting again
but im taking it slow
so hopefully ill have that setup and maybe a test then
heater arrives tmrw
hotend is all built, just not mounted yet since im waiting for a heater cartdrige
but itll work
less cool than magnets
i see, potentially a circle with a lump on it would work
yeah i guess optical would be the only option, im trying to stick with recycled options, anything else?
hey anyone know how i could have a endstop but have the motor be able to spin past it
i need to be able to trigger but move past it
just a spinning motor
i first tried a flag connected via magnets but they arent strong enough
they let me hit the endstop and keep spinning but they couldnt trigger it
or a way to make it not retract during homing
anyone know of a way to telll klipper that a stepper is homed even if it isnt
bruh moment
thanks, both of you
kinematic is irrelevant here i think
anyone know if you can specify just one stepper in klipper
next youll tell me drilling holes through my cpu for better ventilation was a bad idea
what a crazy world we live in eh
TIL
but no clue how to spec them
i might be able to use a capcitor tho
bruh
i lost my buck converter
i prefer .6-1.2mm nozzles
yike
my first big print was a biggie vase with a 1.2mm nozzle
not bad
oh no
idiot
heh
they ended up selling it for a fiver
pretty weird right
yup
with a ripping 70mm/s
poor naive me
watch this and read some comments
hard
and they pulled
it was glued down
and they responded an hour later with this
i told them to flip the glass over and try the smooth side
wasnt me but a friend
lemme find a classic post
i do understand tho, i pitty anyone who had to help me in my first year of pritning
why
and steams
but now it bubbles
i was told to put my filament somewhere airtight so i put it under water so no air touches it
shall i update marlin to 2.0.0
i unplugged a stepper while it was on and some smoke came out the motherboard
''can someone point out the extruder, i cant find it''
Sometimes I'm just not bothered enough to argue with someone when they're so so wrong
Gotta attract cats somehow

Needs some more sugru (I thinkt thats what the white shizz is)
the funnies
google iphone wide angle lens and those work pretty well
<:sheesh:927939329060388894>
changing the focus is best for doing uo close or further away work
nope, it comes preset from factory to work at a average desk-------> person distance
itll be great
and 1.8ghz
48v
next ill overclock
<@!692094950548176957>
one of these
it comes factory tuned for a desk------>person distance focus, theres a ring you spin for getter focus, while your at it check out wide angle lenses
did the same with my abs warp tests, used a spatula to pry them off and in the process i bent them up in the corners
in which case i can drill through a m5 bolt t make a nozzle. but if i need a special conical hole im SOL
so maybe it bends there
the heatsink its fed into is heated but also has a cooling fan. but again its the only conical place
it seems simple but the nozzle isnt flareed out at the back so where does it start bending
does anyone have experience with pull-struding plastic bottles to filament or mind looking at a design, im struggling to get my head sround how it works
glue them into a huuuge stick then glue it to his desk
Damn. Guess you'll need to buy new stepper drivers to huh
really depressing news
oh no, thats just heart wrenching
soon youll be limted by the x axis
now time to fling that bed at 500mm/s
woo hoo
check that too
no physical difference in coil a and b. so if b consistently connects to a and vice versa its ok
iirc that will be fine as long as the coils are connected
continuity test
also try probing
not sure, if it makes grinding noises when you try power it up and move then yes
downright offensive if you ask me
really quite horrid that they delivered the steppers during a stress free period where you have tons of free time
well now thats egregious
darn, its a shame your printer really *forced* you to buy those new steppers huh
np, we're all here because we love the same thing
feel free to ping anyone
pretty cool
and enclosure material
but cooling and z is what im stuck at
probably e3ds

read bottom up
a short story in two parts
<@!754413030359695461>
ill see if i can find the board but it may be in the bin
ive got too but you never know
all im saying is i dont want to be the chump whogets the ''rip <@!579620337692442637>  died in a tragic mosfet explosion''
ive got a few glass panes i use
im not dying via mosfet
thankfully im no idiot so wheever i test new electronics i set up a little blast shield
scorched a little too
second explosion was when i shorted the 24v line to the 3.3v on a skr 1.4 and the mcu cracked and a few components broke and let out smoke
thankfully didnt test it connected to a pi sinc i was dubious of my soldering skill
took a high power buck converter and directly shorted the output and made a big bang
Mine sparked and exploded and lodged a chunk of stuff in the wall
Ive broken my fair share of boards
looks open since theres no connector to the hotend from the sensor
those are all the 3d jake deals i thought were worth it (very subjective )
yeha same, i thought it would be ~30
so if you were gonna buy it, nows the time
cht is also 2 quid off
dogs
<:wesmart:890660011531989072>
Gotta get yo self a reference cube
24v tho
also final question: send config maybe its something in there
perhaps its frame
does input shaper tuning look normal
also if you unplug the steppers does the machine move without bumps or resistance no matter the speed
do they maybe need relubing
and have you checked the bearings by hand, theyre smooth
but the way the motors 'hum' is it consisten at those speeds
what steppers and are they consistent in pitch/vibration during the funky moves
that is funky
mb i missed that
what length screws did you use for the block
usually
just go slow at the start of the turn and at the very end go fast af and its all good
also once you nail the technique itll catch everytime
other than a slight chncae of it not catching but a little bit mof due dilligence will fix that
yup, it wont be as easy as the snaz ones but no reason against it
no vchance of bottoming out
m3x8 is best imo
too long and they could bottom out before holding stuff together
are the bolts the correct size on the linear rails
especially anything that holds linear rails
make sure every bolt is solidly in
it looks so rendered and way too smooth
spot is awsome
silly zuck-bot bbq sauce is for eating
r/technicallythetruth
idm if not
ive got my choice of cells i just dont want to choose the wrong electronics
hey <@!330112131120889866>  do you feel like helping me choose a BMS and whatnot that i would need for a powerwall or powerbank
You can figure out what their attitude is towards the rest of 3d printing and engineering and robotics
It has linear rods
My schools 3d printer sits neglected in a word working shop
Same here, I'm trying to find a part time job but no one's hiring
Jesse k is also our age
Ayyy same
How old are you?
Yeah they didn't have very good tolerance and weren't fantastic
or just sub par
no, no, not broken but slightly wonky. like a shoe has bad stitching or a hot block has some blemishes
huh
would they not just sell it at a lowered price behind a different storefront
That too, i imagine its like some 'clones' are from the same manufacturer except one is the low quality materials and items that fail QC
one company probably buys the lower quality ones that failed the other companys QC and sells those at a low price
although it doesnt stay flat when it zooms around
it teleports around so quick
yup
finally found it
and was mostly for pick and place
and had 8 wires attachment points
it was steel wire iirc
cant find the video but ill @you if i find it
lemme see if i can find it
also the minimal frame is very nice
and they can be very fast
^
i think both need to be copper for it to matter although im not too sure, heat conductivity gets my head all screwy
you want it between heatbreak and heatsink none between the block and break, and anything inside the block e.g heater, thermistor should have
they use it all over iirc
thats what boron nitride is, slice uses it
to help it have low backlash around the rod
a tight fit around the bearing
hm, i dont see it, which way does it wobble
i recall hearing they work best when strapped in but im not 100% sure
and theres play when they are screwed in tightlyt
what holds them in, how are they mounted?
pretty cool
could use a berd air system directly blowing air over the mosfets and chip
mostly considering whether its worth it currently , ill let you know if i go through with it
do you have a video guide for that
i think
xtar vc4
yup
individual
here we go
alright, i can fully charge all of them but theyll be different capacities since theyre from a recycled e bike
and would it be viable to try line some of my backpack with those cells and use fr4 as protection or would i be better off with a hard box
all recycled
i found a guy 3hrs away selling batterys for 25p per cell
what tools do i need, also how dangerous is it to build one
does anyone have experience with making 18650 battery packs
potential slip is the only downside i see (smaller contact patch)
is that a m5 nut in a 2020 extrusion thats had the sides grinded down
thomas sanladerer has dond this iirc
Potentially. Those arms are fairly heavy though. And not sure about accuracy but with enough effort you could do anythinf
Hydralic pistons direct driving?
In what way?  Which parts
but in the shade its bright enough to look well lit and not shady
no shadows under the car
Thankfully, his house, his problem
I found that out when a friend told me hot grapes are good, just microwave them
Cool cool, overnight?
Dry or with water?
Duh
Same for testing motors plug it into the wall
I know i know, you have to stick them in a wall socket first
Thanks, ive also found a friend who'll help me repair/teardown and sell whatever cant be fixed in exchange for parts. So assuming i can collect it everytbhing is going swimmingly
I slam the keys hard (force of habit) so holding down a key just bruises my finger
Ive gotton into the habit of using it for capitals at the start of sentences and words
Sorry for caps lock, left it on by accident
MY PARENTS ARE LOOKING AT GOING ON A DAY TRIP IN THAT DIRECTION ANYWAYS SO IF ITS CHEAP I MAY ASWELL TRY FIX IT OR EVENTUALLY SCRAP IT FOR SPARE BITS
It sells for 600 refurbished so i may spend the currently 0.99 (it'll proabably go up but if it stays bellow 15 GBP ill get it)
Collection only, i can suck up the drive
Time is no constraint
Oh no
Weird ive never noticed any smell
What printer has 20mx20m
Check the annex engineering discord, a few of them know that tyope of stuff
Ah cool, no problem then
Upload then?
Try it yourself. Set high microstepping native and move the gantry against a spring or against your hand. Redo with 1x
That's not right. I run 64x native stepping and the motors can support the entire printers weight
Losses are minimal
Not particularly. Start a move at low speed and set a lower motor power then try again without interpolation
Yes. That's what it does
Interpolation doesn't. St3althchop does. Two values. Similar impact on noise very different impact on torque at higher speeds
turn on interpolation
why?
compare it to a previous vid and its proper
so to a computer analysing the audio its identical
thats cause its the same song/ beat
Ah man I gotta make thst sometime
Alright ill try cad up something goodif i put the tip on a sealed box and a fan that exuahsts air from the box will that work
Eh, ill find a fan
Nah i think its water boiling, too much of it, reduced it and got thicker fog, and less bubbling
Had too much water before
Also added my glycerin and much more smoke
Bruh the battery cant hold a charge i got one short puff of smoke then low battery
No fan yet, trying to get a duct up, in the meanstime what can i do, the popping is fine it does it every time it powers up
Very little smoke comes out. Although I think I put too little glycol and too much water
Also its a smok rpm m80 pro
It pops when I press the button tho
<@324285377533968394>. I got another vape. Ive filled it with the glycol stuff and a bit of water. I'm using a rgc pod iirc and 40W with a full charge and .17 ohm coil
Good thing prints never go wrong
*oh no*
Oh no
And i do need the pod right
Oh phew
Any reccomendations
That should be the ez part
Alright, ill go ask for a pod, so i just get a duct for a fan that connect to the pod outlet and get a power connector that just skips the battery
Otherwise i have all the tools i should need to get this worling
Although if iu dont need the fan it would be nice
Yup, ive got the fan and i know how im powering the vape too ( fan port)
If I need a pod I can get one, and it doesn't need to be safe enough to directly inhale, this is just for cool effects
Sorry ots so late. Got really sidetracked
Lemme send some photos of what ive got
<@!324285377533968394>  are you able to help?
Alright, ill look around the internet, but it sounds like the pod is what i need, ill send a few pics later, boutta do vr with a friend
In dummy terms for someone whos never held a vape, which part do i want to open to make smoke with
Ive got glycerin
I just want to try this out as a fun side project while i wait for some ali stuff to arrive, are these not easy to open up
I have a juul and vype epod
Never had one and im starting to think the coil/heater is in the pod not the case
Making a smooke machine  from a broken vape <@!265629116106145793>
Does anyone own/mod vapes, i need a wuick bit of help
Not sure how that will affect it
Theres a section of direct filament contact
I would do different ports or use a external mosfet
Cant remeber the name for it, but you know what janitors use the retractable spool thing
He used no gearing and  a key holder thingy to hold the gantry up
You could use like jo0shmurrah and have a super low hold current (or none)
Im a bit slow today, counted my used slots as 0, 1, 2, 3
My bad
Unless you dont want auto tramming in whichcase 3
Then youll have 2 spare
Ive got 3 spare slots and im on one z, 2 motion, 1 extruder
Yup
Grinding disl instead of cutting disk
Lol same
Its a beginner kit for schools that I got so its meant to be low temp
The one I have melts around 230 ish
I guess a high temp one wont
Won't solder melt at that temp
You could use boron nitride to get it to stick together
Not too shabby
Ah shang chi is gonna be awsome
Ah no problem i have pleenty of home work, id be glad to redirect it to you, you can re-experience the joys of surds and creative writing
Good thing I understand that completely. I think I was learning about that last week in high school science /s
Oh man I can't wait to see this
Is it for a vzbot
Its so chunky
Hahahahahahahahahahahahah
Before you do that just take a peice of string and a weight and try counterweight, I added one and it worked fairly well
Real pro would just build second z to carry it. 2 lead screws on the side and a wood beam to support it. Bur assuming the blocks are fine you could use a counterweight to make it sag less and let you print parts
For side mount take a look at some hevorts, some are on the side
Oh yeah
Correct me if I'm wrong but aren't watts kinds pulled through the system unlike voltage which is pushed through wether the electronics want it or not

eauro car parts sells white lithium grease for 6 quid for a can
dry ptfe or normal grease
he didnt have a good time
<@402169283167256589> tried it out ages ago
cling film inside a carrier bag?
double layer shopping bags?
i used a plastic bag
im using some white lithium grease, 500g tub from eurocar parts for ¬£5
anything that needs grease gets a glob from the tin, ive had it about a year now and have barely made a dent
And have a peruse
Put that in the search bar
from:douglasdcds#9326  ceramic
It was <@402169283167256589>
But their account has been dead for a while
One of the admins tried it out (I think it was in this server) but they had worse or same results
I think that's the guy polishing the blocks tracks
Someone made a flow splitter for volcano, that and a cht is bound to be insane
It's close but magnum plus still beats it out
Yup
Lower than?
A little better than magnum but not close to magnum plus
They ain for industry level printers tho. Fat ass 1.8mm nozzle printer mainly
theyre the highest flow hotends currently availbe
but superlube, machine lube or dry ptfe spray are all fine for high speed
i wanted a long lasting lube for medium speed so i got white lithium (good deal at uero car parts, 5 quid for 500g)
unless its super nice rails and super nice ceram your better off with well lubed chromed
thats ceram right, dont bother
dont worry about ceramic bearings they dont add much as far as ive seen
not terrible
misumi arrive with one missing
shouldnt have a full rack
designed to have 1 missing
if theres no visual or physical difference then its probably fine for a 3d printer
the biggest factor is the machining and molding on the end caps and inner races
the emplty space wont have a huge impact other than load capacity
you want 1 ball empty minimum
phew
although wd40 specialist dry ptfe lube is fine
DO NOT USE WD40 ON THE RAILS
also the uk has very little in terms of hobby thats made on the island
if you dont mind the wait then usongshine is where its at
h, assumed you bought more rails for the heck of having more rails
lucky bugger
hm, weird
weird, did the internal look smooth or where there steps in the machining
if not you did fully drain the pre applied oil and get out any metal scraps
damn thats rough, did you try aliexpress dispute, they usually sort stuff pretty well
damn, how much were those for the full set
ive got some sleeping to attend to so ill reply in the morning, ciao
but not two rails for one block
you can have two block on one rail
that is incredibly unadvisable , i wouldnt feel good telling you to buy the required rails
do you mean aligning 2 rails
havent gpt any but i hear usongshine is really good
make sure it actually on the bearings
i would get the block half off and spray in the grease
also check the frame is fully square
best you can do is reassemble and grease well
damn mine was 26 for the full set of 3 and was similar
mine had the same pattern
a lot of people get 3 varying conditions of rail when they buy cheap
one perfect, one a bit loose and another chunky one?
<@!733481355840716910>
it took me a while but i did a full set of 3 on my first try
are they thouroughly cleaned and did you trty reasemble
Yeah as long as it's smooth I wouldn't worry
maybe, depends what ypur using, sometimes it takes some use to get the grease well in there
but make sure theres no play on the carriage
lowest resistance is best
yes
could also check the used market
i hear usongshine on aliexpress is pretty good, not sure about shipping though
Chrome steel is the best (at lower prices)
Should do assuming diameter is right
Shouldn't do. Just make sure theres at least one gap
You should talk to douglasdcds about them. He currently (I think) hss them installed
You can also try the usongshine from ali
Degrease----->wipe rail with thin oil (machine oil or shredder oil or anything thin works maybe dry ptfe but not sure)---->spray ptfe into block and move bearings and spray again
Ipa, gasoline and acetone have all been tried, ipa is the safest since some blocks have rubber parts and the last two will dissolve those
If you have oil just dab in on a rag and wipe down the bare rail and spray some dry ptfe into the blcok
*in
The ball bearings on the block
After stupidly adding back some used aceton to the bottle it leaves a thin film of plastic on everything so. Yeah. Dont do that if you use it
Yup for my mgn12, not sure about mgn9 tho
Should be nice for a high temp setup
Siick
You could always wipe a thin layer of oil on the rail and ptfe on the block
if my rail is very poorly machined will i get artifacts from switching to a dry lube
Cheers
Ah cool, do thr usongshine blocks run well on all rails or just their rails
well, they are lighter, so
definitely
if they were 'premium' i would say hell nah and return them but if theyre cheap then its worth it
never mind then
inductance?
fair enough
or rectangle
wait, why not a 10x10 cf tube
oopsie
i assume its becuase the ptfe is teeny tiny whereas this is small but not that small chunks of graphite
oh cool, ptfe it is
very nice, seems like they can be rounder but no faster unless you have a enclosure
but i would reccomend removing any plastic and afaik the metal should be fine
well, i left mine out for months after a good clean in acetone
Thank you
<@402169283167256589>
Dang. So its worse overall, I assume thats from them being undersized and introducing play
nice, my best idea in z is to keep the entire bed fully constrained and have the plate held down by springs under the screw cap, when the bed warps it just raises freely but it cant move in the xy. and have the brass nut free to move in xy but not rotationally or in z, the bed would shake with the leadscrew it would only move up or down
im no pro at z, i think whatevers most rigid and constrains the bed
best way it to align with rails so theyre on the same plan or just reduce the distance between your nozzle and block and keep the center of gravity on the rail
What's noise like and how do you control it?
you can also add air pockets for even more insulation
yup. meant to write ''rtv'' not ''rtd'', sorry
could always get rtd silicone stuff and make your own/repair what you have
yup, from the photos i thought it was headsized or something close, not palm size
whos gonna mount this on the printer
Under 30
Very low power
if you can have it mimic the 5015 and control it via hotend port then youll be set with a ''off_below:''
could lik them and have rcss have a minimum power so whenevr the 5015 is above that it kicks in
honestly not sure how you would do that
whats the end goal?
for getting a binary on or off that would be fairly useless for a part cooling fan
setting in slicer a maximum of 50% will mean the gcode will request a max of 0.5 and in firmware you define 1.0
so you get 0.5(slicer) x 0.5(firmware limit) = 0.25
if yopu want a max power of 50% then when the slicer commands 50% youll reall get 25% power
max_power: 0.5
the smell is nasty tho, gotta use it outside
ah lol,i got mine with a really thin wedge tip, the deeper it goes the wider the cut and if you rotate it you get a even wider cut
same, i use it occasionally for cutting thin plastic shells
same, but a good iron makes it much more enjoyable
still get a new one though, but while you wait sanding it may be useful
consider sanding it lightly
probably the paper towel
they shipped my flip knife as metal wrench so im sure theyll send leaded solder as something innocuous
this is all i could find
'Under the Water Fittings Regulations and Byelaws, the use of lead solder for jointing copper pipes is prohibited in plumbing systems which supply water for drinking, cooking or bathing. Solder containing lead can only be used on water installations not used for drinking, such as closed circuit central heating systems.'
lemme google
one of us is wrong
i dunno
it is?
someone feel free to correct me im not too experienced in this
thats lead free it looks like, i think common opinion is unless theres a specific aversion to lead its better to use a lead solder
do you have a photo of the solder?
üò≥  when you've been using silver pla to solder for the past yearüò≥      /s
i think the paper might be the issue, get a Damp sponge and try soldering a few wires
pinecil is also quite nice, quite cheap too
sheeeeesh
I have one tip for cutting plastic that's grim and one for soldering that's a little less grim because I don't use it properly
coincidentlly i also had mine bhreak there
ah fair enough
where'd it break?
yup, clicked on it for some backround nosie when ep1 came out and now im hooked
Carbon fiber tube is used on the hevort afaik
it usually exits the vent
wdym where dies it come out
if you feel like waiting ~3-4 weeks i can have elliot ship to me to give to family to take to US to ship to you üòÜ
If it's at full speed all the time then maybe a step down converter
<:soon:906671622612742185>
what spec fans?
just a thought
have you tried using rtv sealant around the leaky connections, some release on one side and rtv on the other to make a gasket
Flush cutters to the rescue
The inlet is covered
Even cheap paste is usaully better
I would avoid thos epads though
Im also looking at water cooling, so far decide that cooling a heatpipe soldered to the motor will be easiest and safest for me
Found this too
Ill see if i can find it
There are a few mufflers that exist
Weird, i guess the guy got lucky. I really though that was gonna be the end all be all of silencers
Slap a good intake on there and boom
Oh damn, much better than any other thing ive seen
would a slit be better than holes or is there no real difference
Higher rpm=more airflow
Sunon is quieter and delta is max noise max performance
Sunon or delta fans are good
Distilled water
Ah. Could try sealing it post print with a thicc abs slurry or friction weld
What slicer
Yeah like <:this:844139463419887618>
Mayaswell add some for the sake of it
I thought ots to get rid of tubulence and straighten flow which would really get a blower fan too
Yup or at the exit]
Not sure what its called
The grid stuff
add vanes while you're in cad
itll lean enough to not melt for a while
just put a spacer on the right side of the fan
Thanks for the link
I kept finding the teeny baby ones
Like if i wanted to buy it of ali what would i search
Oh boy, down the rabbit hold of water cooling
And iirc the fan showdown guy had succes with a 3d printed rad
And tubing
Ive got a pump and a couple heatsinks
Pics
Looks really pretty
Nice
Less ringing since theyre softer any vibrations can be absorbed a bit
Yup, it was definetly surprising
Could you send a link? Or file
Is the strobe controllable
Lol i made some crap rgb versions of those today
Oh this is too perfect
Wait a minute, i could control my smoke generator with a hotend output/ssr (ill probably do hotend output but a ssr is less effort) then at the end of a print i can make smoke so when i open the enclosure my leds can go red and smoke pours out
Lmao, thats gonna be awsome to see, you may need to supplement smoke at the end of the pipe tho, it dissipates when aggravated , also please light it well
Pog
==
Smoke generator + vape juice
Probably, but i imagine smoke generators are just beefy vapes
Nice, time to go ask around if anyone has a broken one
Would a vape work
But a bank/stack would give more pressure
At that point you could just stack a ton of 120mm noctuas
Damn, thats pretty poor
Ah, was just looking at a cool hoverboat thingy that used one and thought why not
Why not use a edf for cooling
I wonder if different brands perform differently if the same size
Nice, guess it makes fan choices ez
Seems like all the wide opening have angles and the smallee ones have a straight outputs
Lol. Pretty cool to see, would side lighting in a dark room make the smoke easier to see
So the empty gap where air wasnt coming out is now non existant so in simply terms this 'is beter' but only kinda
You need more space in front of it than a blower
Im 15 in september
Yes, clearly
If you can, could you video it accelerating and decellerating
Oh?
Ask @4swe  in annex to try do a cfd test
Ooo, theres a guy who could do cfm testing for free
Could use a mesh and straws to make a laminar flow
But at the opening all the air is turbulent so you need to make it laminar then use vanes at the end of the duct
I thought vanes should go all the ways through
Abs+
I have some really nice prints on it, just add some more cooling
Yes, abs plus works great with some cooling at 215+
Also I was considering taking a old fridge from a tip and making it a enclosure
I remember seeing a vid of h3vacs at full blast working with a speedbenchy so in terms of warping ymmv?
Does it have those vane thingies?
We can cut bits and bobs from theres or improve it but do majority OC
both work, shenanigans are less effort overall (depending on how its all mounted)
or just not put it on the side with rods
have duct that expands around the thingies
either
true, but its better with a duct
But you do need a pipe to build pressure so a curled spiral around the 2 fans would build that pressure and then vent it down to the printer
I'm thinking a coiled pipe that splits down from the top into modular fittings to vent the air in
Yay
Berd air or hevacs is next design. Just wanna clarify before I start modifying the hevacd
just find a 24v version then?
my bad, i can run 2 on 2 buck converters then
but i culod put 2 outside and use the air to cool my whole printer
dang it 12v, ill either have to run it at 50% max or get a buck converter
assuming its legit
cheap fans
lol i bought a bulk pack of 4020 for 12v and run them at 24, ocasionally they die but its cheap sooo
but i do wonder if that or cpap would be enough to provide some electronics cooling on a cr10 and part+ electronics on a corexy
im sure my skr will handle it, those things are notoriously hard to break and have wonderful mosfets /s
might buy one of those to cool both my printers
hows that long duct working, is it any good
Well theres a 5: 20 benchy with dual 5015 iirc
Yeah. I think
Try a 5015 at the very top to aid flow if you choke the fans
i sure hope you dont keep a duck on the printhead
problem is, its gotta be longe nough but not too long
i thing a wider tube connecting to a thine one would be best with a 5015 at the top to aid pressure
Yeah. It should be fine but thats a very long tube
Yeah that's good
Whats the number
You do need some built up pressure but choked means no air
If its already choked, no difference. If it isn't then you'll hear
You can hear the difference, try it with a small fan, its fairly clear
if it sounds like its speeding up when the duct it connected then its being choked otherwise its all good
damn, beefy
You can calculate static pressure with a flow simulation i think and if the ducts pressure is higher then it wont work
What static pressure are they
As long as it doesnt choke the fan it should be fone
Also. Sick render
That cooling looks pretty cool, does it work and whats it calles
check out teaching tech for aguide of cfd
yeah you can upload any duct/part for mechanical analysis
welp then its unreasonably loud
dang it, 241 cfm is much more impressive
well if you can live with 65db then these are great 
alright, alright
quick question: roughly when would you want to start making the duct
Best you can do is use a fluid dynamics simulation (ive got a good online one I use) to test your duct, amd since you have a model of the printer it should be easy to test
I'm happy to help with whatever I can, I'm not a professional but did look at making my own duct and came to the conclusion I'm not good at CAD
A quick turn makes you slow down whereas a gentle turn lets you go full speed
Im no pro but a immediate duct is like a sharp turn versus taking a very long and gentle turn
Need q tube or else you'll lose a lot of performance
Nope
True axial take more room in this case
Also the negative pressure allows you to use one large axial to cool a ton of stuff. But it wont work if you use blowers
For their smaller size? How big are these fans
Also why 2 blowers instead of 2 axial
Static pressure is just the force behind the air. Your fan ducts static pressure needs to be lower than your fans or else the fsn will slow down and barely work
And a high static pressure fan allows you to get really good suction
Use negative pressure to cool the board and stuff and push air into the part
I wonder if mounting them over the electronics would be good
Have you seen the delta fans, very noisy but 250cfm
This is the project btw
He reached out to me by DM too, he wanted to forward my project to GitHub education for their newsletter as they sponsor the charity
This is from the CEO of a charity called hack club
In the first paragraph, they mention example projects, the first one is mine!
Hey guys, wanted to share a win with you all
guest house ü§® üòè ?
wowowowow it looks so nice
CEO of vez3d üéâüéâüéâ
That's awesome
WOOOO congratulations man
haha i meant to reply somewhere else but yes- asking if he was attending boeing employee trainign would suit
Boeing?
Dang that looks so cool
hey <@210780931303276544>  we could sell in the USA and UK fairly easily, my brother would probably be cool with sending out parcels and i/jay can do UK
No more glasses?
Ayyy nice
Tuesday is polyurethane day and then Wednesday I'll glue the granite
Tomorrow I'll finish sanding the frame down
Tonight I'm doing the filler and gluing the wood accents
I'm building a table from entirely reclaimed materials
Half done üòé
Haha from a distance that looks like it says dick shield
That's so cool!
Yeah I'm hoping some of my issues are with low tip temps (hardened steel) that a sock would fix and overhangs being heated by the hotend
Thanks pb, I'll order a provok then, I've been holding off on putting my sock back on since the wires might break when I move the temp sensor
Cool, I saw that and a provok3d one mentioned a lot
The wire insulation has broken at the base, I'm hoping the actual wire doesn't break yet
mines showing signs of wear
what brand does the best m3 pt1000
gonnna be famous
oooh sick
awesome! good luck ü§û
that sounds awful, hoping you get well soon
congrats!
ah see what i mean, night time fever work is never good
I'm going to wait for the morning. Trying it late at night with a fever doesn't seem too wise üòÇ
Not sure I'm doing it right, 30hz is crazy low
Still no clue why I can't get a quality print over 250mm/s üò≠
Cool all good there then
Oh yeah the Freq thing
The other thing, what do you run a LDO extruder motor ay
I've got no way to check it rn because no adxl but when I get ill check
Are there any other bits and bobs I should do
Yeah will do
Got this error tho üò≠
I'll recreate it while I'm watching the printer
Oh gotcha yeh they all rotate
Not rn
what would point to awd not working
no heatsinking other thhan the frame, and yeah i think AWD is working
they usually just get super hot but not skip
theyre getting 2A, skipped maybe 20m into a print. 100C bed but open doors
How hot are your guys steppers getting
Whyy
Bruh it skipped steps at 250mm/s 20k acceleration
not intentionally, just noticed it was half un done when i heated the hotend so screwed it in
just in case
yup, hot tightened
only way to get a good sheen on the print is print 290c but it completely cooks the filament, i still have underextrusion
im really lost on this
it still doesnt work right
how else can i check it other than room temp
but my rotaion distance is odd, i have to cook my filament to get it to work. its all very odd
im really not sure where the issue is
its a pt1000, plugged into the right port and reads room temp correctly, so it seems fine
no unfortunately not
i would put the sock back on but the thermistor wires insulations already split and im worried about breaking it
but those numbers are so wrong üò≠
so 290 looks better than 230
its not a matte PLA either
yeah
they were 230
that was 290c
2
Very rounded
With my calculated value it now looks not crap
okay,im gonna test print with my calculated value and then the same print but with 
Gear_ratio: 50:10
rotation_distance: 22 
since i know that doing it without the gear ratio didnt work
#VZHextrudort LDO 20mm
#rotation_distance: 4.71
thats all in i need in the config yes?
doing a manual calibration ive got 3.6 rotation distance twice in a row
I'm not sure, would you send your config
its currently 4.41 in the config. gonna change to 3.5721 and re calculate
also wtf did a rot distance check, requested 50mm and got 40.5 üíÄ
its not a PID isue, zoom into the second pic, the slicer is setting some really weird temp targets
Extra cooling didn't help. I'm going to try some even hotter temps
the temp targets
i dont think SS generated it correctly
but anyways
ive probably got it set up wrong in config, ive just done the multi pin and fan thing
yup
mine seems to only run at 100% or nothing, which ill sort out once i figure out the extrusion
cpap only
ill try again
cool
checked the gcode, it stays at 50 the whole time
50%
gonna try the rotation distance tune in a bit, just doing some other work
used superslicers generator
<@451709396280410132> I'm completely out of ideas
Ah okay so no sock plus hardened steel I'll be adding 30 üòÇ
no still on the default, i can do tho. i assumed itd be flow id want to change and not rotation distance
<@451709396280410132>
This looks a lot like I'm extruding cold
I am currently running sock-less is that a big issue? Could the nozzle be a lot cooler than the rest of the hotend
Printed at the same time to ensure there were no issues with layer time slowing it down. Followed all the above advice
Gotcha, I'll drop the Accel too
It's what IS recommended
46k default
Don't think so, I've tried 2 holders both with long reverse tubes
Ac I'll go slice a couple annex cubes, 220c 300 and 400 mm/s. PA 0, anything else I should change to make it fair
Fair, that won't fix the under extrusion tho will it?
Gcode for the print, 150mm/s default speed using vez's super slicer profile
The first layer is too squished but that's cause I haven't adjusted the offset yet
Dryed some unopened UZY Pla for 6 hours at 40c, printed at 220c
Will do, have you printed with any filament from UZY, my options are slim for quality filament
my temp graphs are rock solid
is it almost 100% going to be a hotend issue
what can i do to figure out why?
rn im maxing out around 30mm/s^3 my top surfaces look terrible at this
also, the twirled gears did spin my TPU. it was interesting
welp i can at least get some parts done in the morning but after school ill work on getting it working at speed
that was frustrating to work with
much better
on a USB now
onto a USB it goes
thank god i had cloned the sd card yesterday
agh this stuff is frustrating
nope never mind its still incredibly slow
now it works
it seems to change on a whim. befoer it couldnt acess the mcu, next it cant connect by internet, next it can connect but its slow
i dont understand this little computer at all. its now working
wired ethernet
what error could happen so spontaneously
is my storage failing or something?
it took 10m to pull up the interface for kiuah via Putty
i had it working last night and now tonight its just incredibly slow
im stuck again with this printer, ive been trying for a few hours now to connect
I'll check the pantry but I don't think so üòú
PLA üòì
What tool should I use for that, i don't want to scratch it up in there
Ugh this is frustrating
I'm not sure if that under extrusion is from the leak or from a different issue in the extrusion path
I really don't know what to do
Tightened up at 300c
New nozzle, same issue with leaking
üòé
He hooked me up with a free nozzle
Met up with jof in central London today
Awesome
Also can I copy paste my microsd to a usb and have everything boot just like that
Is it better to go over 5.1?
Maybe similar issue, I can boot with the cartographer installed but not the screen, running off a buck converter
üòÇ
35 years old?
yeah, we can remove <#1023699467918114848> and leave a link to the docs site in <#832505050441711666>
<#1023699467918114848> too
almost all of this is outdated
we say theres no kit available
with <#832505050441711666> being a big issue
hey reading through the <#832505050441711666> and <#946930214452199524> both are pretty out of date
Hopefully we'll meet up again in 2024
I wouldnt have my last year any other way
Happy new year's everyone!!
wow looks lovely, where is that?
If everyone doesn't decide to use resolve, I have free access
Feel free to use my school account
is that adobe
wow your son looks just like you, thats a beautiful pic
haha id bring my dad probs
I feel like it's going to be awkward as hell
Should I have a pint with BTT
And the fact she was followed the two youngest VzBot members üíÄ
It was hard to talk to her
She was barely intelligible
my cr10 üíÄ
oh dear
sorry im so late
hey ill be on in a sec
Lemme sign up
Ooh
Can a edu licence join those?
Haha that reminds me I need good ear plugs
Will do, I've got my pc safety goggles üòÅü•Ω
The only things these engrave is my retina üòé
üòé
The new one is certainly better at range and has a larger hot spot
Though idk how that compares for actual light output
Should be a 5x increase in power
Left is the new UV, right is my old UV
I have a tutor then
Could it be one hour later
he tested flow in stealthchop mode
the extruder has less features and is apparently the min viable product since no tension adjustment
the smaller motor has less torque and power but its "okay"
god is he dense
no need to rub it in tom
haha its fun tho
my eyes hurt
got the high power UV light assembled
<@276016956245540864> final haul of free stuff
üòÆ‚Äçüí®
seems to be that way everywhere nowadays
ah thats fair
wont pretend to be a doc, but that looks passable i suppose. my first aid training just says if its arterial then tourniquet and ER
that cut looked gnarly
me personally, id stop by and ask someone to have a look just in case
you sure? its not just blood clotting outside the wound?
doc
If it's going to your heart beating that really sounds like an artery cut which probably won't heal too easily
Go to a doc
Realised I could probably get jlcpcb to do it
Ah rip
I'd be on the floor in the fetal position
üò≠ alcohol
i read online that parabolic reflectors are better than using a lense for this type of bulb but idk how true that is, so someday id like to make a large reflector based thrower
but if i find a rear projection tv in my area im gonna get multiple lamps (no reflector) and stick them behind the fresnel
im putting the bulb behind a 400mm fresnel
dead-lad üíÄ
a mercury arc lamp ballast, aliexpress.com/item/1005001869866072.html
but after that itll never be touched
i need to poke it with my multimeter while its on to check everythings outputting the right voltage
that too
oh actually enough of the solder pad sticks out
theyre pretty well hidden and untouchable, should i make them more exposed?
i havent finished my RS order yet should i inlcude a fused outlet
nah but the cable im using is
still terrifying
so that helps
but ive got a 1Mohm resistor in parallel to the massive capacitor to help discharge it
the 325v dc supply scares me
yippee
<@451709396280410132>  odds i die?
üòé
power supply for the searchlight
its 51.2mm
the diameter on the central hole, 0.1mm each side. i can go over size but not under
is 0.1mm tolerance okay
also would you be able to do a second part thats like a retaining ring
hey <@276016956245540864> what tolerances should i use
just realised i should print it and test fit
hey <@276016956245540864>  you havent machined it yet have you?
okay <@276016956245540864>  i think this is what i need, one hole to slot the bulb into where ill glue it in, 4 screw holes around it
so imma use thermal compound to glue it to the alum
i need to mount a really hot bulb that doesnt have any mounting points on it üíÄ
awesome
idk how to design for cnc, is it okay if i make a model of the final part or does it need certain features?
thats okay üëç, lemme get a cad made
hey would someone with a CNC do me a favour, i need a 2mm thick (or whatever thickness sheet you have) sheet of metal (any metal)with a 48mm hole and 4 mounting points, i can pay for it too but if someone would machine that and bring it to smrff
looks fire üî•
im sharing a room with her üíÄ
yeah
if the shipping is quicker, im in london and can carry them up
id love a black goliath one please
That's wonderful, nowhere better than surrounded by your friends and family
thats so cool <@509772297289072653> honestly sounds unreal
Thanks for the kind words
Thank you üôè
And there's me looking uncomfortable in a suit
Received my Arkwright scholarship today üòé
Yes ‚ù§Ô∏è
if every 2 minutes, could it display exact number instead of xx.xxK
man thats wild
that all sounds so fucking cool
im in the US pretty oon iirc
ive got a gf anyways, no sleeping around for me
ahh true im too used to talking with flashlight peeps
does the word "torch" mean something different to you guys
hang on
could be worse
but 1 is a collector item, ones titanium another is brass, ones a high lumen flooder and the other two are smol flooders
ive picked up 7 in 5 weeks
and you all will be subjected to a small showing at smrff
the torch collection has grown üòé
I can remove them from there too
Do we want contributors on <#835879360250118164>
Same I'm pumped to go to my first rrf and meet everyone
Happy birthday <@276016956245540864>
You talk well and have a great accent, where's the downside
That's dope
Yeah him!
I can't remember his name
His intro has the breadboard with the leds
Is it the German electric engineer guy
Is it dale doing the electronics
Where else did you get inspo for the extruder
Ohhh
This is such a amazing opportunity
If I'm right on that
Hevort project!
The grading scheme goes from 1-3 fail, 4-6 average, 7-9 very good
Scraped some decent grades in English, Latin and religion
I've done a bang up job
Woke up at 3 am to get my final grades for secondary school
But
Off topic
It's funny he asks that 
That sounds like a dream come true, this is massive if it works out. I hope to see you in a history book someday
I can't do proper work hours and I don't expect pay tbh but if there's any way I can contribute or be involved
I don't know if you could find anything for me to do, but I'd love to be involved, but don't feel pressured to say yes
That's an incredible opportunity
Dude pay yourself well
Holy shit
I can't offer much, but if I can help in any way I'm down
I will definitely be going back every morning
Got up at 5am for a sunrise walk
Hilton head Island is beautiful
True, I just hope there's no VzBot-voron bad blood in his mind
üòÇ
like the corner brackets arent mentioned as being in the box (i bought some üíÄ )
is there a way i can add to the docs, theres a couple locations and stuffs for items that are missing
ah cool
how many corners can i fit a corner bracket into, docs say 6?
It's tough to see, but they don't touch
theres a few mm of space between them
maybe all are like this, but even when fully tightened, the 460mm 2020 doesnt make full contact with the 2040
okay, my frame is very un-square curently - so if i loosen everything and install the printed brackets should that help square it
ill un-assemble again
that makes sense
dang it
ah ive already rotated mine anyways
thats my bad if so - didnt realise it could work
huh, does the connector even fit?
A lot of small things are wrong with my kit, idk how it got past QC, the motors are installed facing the wrong direction
i think its still workable without those tho
It's like that on both
Only a 5mm hole straight through
Nopüòî
Cool
Ah okay
There should be a 10mm hole there for the head shouldn't there
Idk man the whole frame moves
It's fully tightened
Is this much wobble okay
Cool, as long as I'm on a mattress
So if diemex and I go, do rooms have double beds?
They're excited for me to go üòÖ
Any chance I can squeeze in too
Max for my age is 35
37 hours this week
Although it's technically illegal for me to work these hours üíÄ
I'll just suck it up
Yeahh
Welp for next time ig
Ahh
This work stuff is so stressful
I'll talk to my manager then
Dang
9 hours, 1pm to 10pm
But itd mean I work 5 days in a row, with a 6 hour break between my regular shift and his shift
He asked me to cover a shift for him last night
Am I wrong here
Boys I need advice
Ayyy congrats
Yup
And buff asf
the first and last one look good
More muscle and then it'd be right üòé üëâüëâ
I'm a lifeguard üòé
At my first job
Finished my first Shadow shift
Those look sick üî•
Bruhhh
ugh tell me about it, i still have to visit florida all the time for my grandparents
im happy to drink a bit tho, just gotta be careful
ive got school stuff and a travel card, dont think i can get a drivers til im 17, so i might have something in time for the festival
gotta be 18 to get into clubs/bars
yeah
cause i got a bit of a babyface and no id, I might have to pass on that
just wanna check- where are you guys planning on drinking?
What's it weigh?
I see why it's called waterheater
OH ü§å
Oh I read it used a hotrunner too?
waterheater is the codename of their own hotend
oh the "waterheater" is a hotend i think similar to the goliath that trails, cbon and kmobs (and probably others) are working on/testing
I reckon its the drag force of the air on the nozzle
Tf is wrong with people - I feel bad having to bug sellers because they forgot to package half the product or when it arrives dead. And people have the audacity to show up doing this
Otherwise they get a LOT of free advertising for every website they got
Ask they only have one or two entry options
What's it do different?
Different story
But if I payed
Just needs some sanding here and there
I'd be okay with that if I spent a couple hours with a saw and drill
üòÖ  i guess im just built different- only need 25kg total üí™
eek
he pretty much says its hand made
cool, ill see if i can add them on a 2 week rotation
he chucks me around like a ragdoll sometimes  (im 5 inches taller and considerably heavier)
my friends back looks gnarly from bouldering, hes a teeny tank
are they worth it?
i do squats, press, extension, curls, calf raises and lunges
never tried thrusts or ab/adduction
ü•≥
He was here for the first month or four of vzbot
Aw feel bad for him tho
should we double check with vez
fair enough
Reason being we don't want to get reported by slice for infringing and lose community server status
Or drop links to the store referencing the hote d
Could he still advertise his new hotend like drop links just no images
<@323961338412138497> he ain't happy
Side note, when's the next batch of kits, I'll probably buy
But morally wrong
They're so cheap ü§§
Not me eyeing up those nozzles
wow that looks amazing, have a good time
shape wise
it is slightly different though isnt it
but this is exactly what will make slice look sane
cool its so cheap
idk how mellow sources his driver IC but if its idrect from TMC maybe he can try getting them to help you?
system clock
16
ah
yeah theres no rush, take the day off
Hey <@509772297289072653> did those driver settings make any difference in noise or speed
lemme know if those make any change to the steppers
and maybe driver_PWM_GRAD: 10
driver_HSTRT: -2
<@509772297289072653> try this as well
if it doesnt work try a value of 0
under [tmc5160 stepper ....]
driver_HSTRT: 1
driver_HEND: -3
<@509772297289072653> try these
tho the cs scaler warning gives me pause
i think everything is entered correctly
<@509772297289072653> what motherboard are you using?
top
are you using the top or bottom ones?
> In the context of stepper motor control, TOFF determines the duration of the off-time between two pulses of current applied to the winding. The off-time is used to reduce the magnetic field in the winding and allow the rotor to move to the next step. A longer TOFF value will result in a longer off-time and a slower motor speed, while a shorter TOFF value will result in a shorter off-time and a higher motor speed.
> 
> The value of TOFF is typically controlled by the stepper motor driver, and it can be adjusted to fine-tune the performance of the motor. For example, you may need to increase the value of TOFF to reduce the motor's speed, or decrease the value of TOFF to increase the motor's speed.
> 
> The specific method for adjusting TOFF will depend on the stepper motor driver you are using. Consult the datasheet for the driver you are using for more information.
although i think ive confused it, can you entirely disable slow decay and only use fast decay?
chatgpt just explained it to me, it seems simple enough
go on, ill try suffer through it
same üòé  BUT the calculator sheet seems simple to me *unless * im missing something
page 68 has some explanation of what the slow decay phase is
im seeing the word slow and im thinking, less slow --> moar good
and thats toff
`Sets the slow decay time (off time). This setting also
limits the maximum chopper frequency.
For operation with StealthChop, this parameter is not
used, but it is required to enable the motor. In case of
operation with StealthChop only, any setting is OK.
Setting this parameter to zero completely disables all
driver transistors and the motor can free-wheel`
so tbl is like a time delay for safety?? so setting it to 0is fine for us and just gets moar speed?
are you using their excel spreadsheet for driver tuning?
found that on page 69
sure
`Selects the comparator blank time. This time needs to
safely cover the switching event and the duration of the
ringing on the sense resistor. For most applications, a
setting of 1 or 2 is good. For highly capacitive loads,
e.g. when filter networks are used, a setting of 2 or 3
will be required`
datasheet says tbl is
are you using 5160s?
what steppers?
thats insanely high speed
holy sh!t
And you've said before you prefer this system over everything else
That belt question seems particularly useless, we're open to modding and you could probably copy paste someone elses belt drive onto the vzbot easily enough
he'll be a blue role and just be moderator
nop, he'll be separate to the vzbot team i think
all good to give him the moderation role
he can see <#835879360250118164> still as a moderator, so we can change that role to only view <#918640502096691200>
You can always ask for a small royalty
I'm not the one who chooses but I'd probably buy that
Should I reach out
Yeh me
I think he messaged me or vez first
It's Damian right?
Idk haven't seen him around much
we can say we dont condone it in announcements but people are free to express their opinions
Damn that's huge, weve got very little in terms of vegetation at our house
For "herbs"
Hahaha nice
see what damian makes maybe?
yeah, well see how he does i guess. your all happy with it?
what happened to vzbot.org
also
he wants it to add to his portfolio. seems fair ig
but vzbot
i assume like pc part picker
@damian wants to make a website for the vzbot with a build plan editor. <@509772297289072653>  ill let him know he can get started as long as your okay with it
üòé üòç
oh phew, thought i missed my chance to buy
thats cool
ohhh i see
Is that just someone on the vzbot team or a model sent over to the hevort group
Are we selling them already
I saw this vid from Wayne Dalton who's got one 
Who's got LSD prototypes so far
phishy betta
ew
if i wanted to make one id just try buying parts from alix
idk know how on earth we get all these things like CPU's into phones and even pcbs
but
i know people say theyd go back in time with a phone or alike and speed up technology
cool cool
no professional at all. but ive been told its cause the plasma never touches the walls as they use magnets to keep it moving and ts on a vacuum so its hard to move heat
the 500mb is certainly worth it, for now tho i dont know if its worth 100mb
funn banner
how do you get free nitro?
SpEd Up ObViOuSlY
Yeah I think that'd be the first we reject
what happened to <@346710360562335746> and <@402169283167256589> i havent seen them in ages
oopsie
one guy was asking for 90
good good
has 90 been taken yet?
Hasnt listened after ~3 warnings
I'd be okay with kicking them
Ah true
What about a 3 way split to increase melt capabilities and have the three paths intertwine for a "longer" path
Sure, he's done quite a bit
He's owner. We can't promote people to our own level
Yup
nop
Miht be discord. My friends were complaining about high ping in VC and crashes
ill see if one exists
Bruh moment
I think we've hit 3k but Ill check the exact number when I'm at my pc
Yeah same here til recently
i had a countdown]
look in <#832504857775702028>
so we stay just 2 or 3 away
and people keep leaving
cause weve been so so so close to 3k for 4 days
oh sorry, thats mb. ill keep them out
personally wouldnt know
or a black backround
do we want it to be a transparent emoji
reactions and emojis work just not the sticker
funky
cool, i guess its being censored
witha transparent bacjkround
and is larger
there should be one thats a sticker
did you send it
its like an emoji but bigger üòâ
try : vezhub :
but i can still see it
i get an error message
wait can you see the sticker i sent
can you see the sticker
and
but it works
or high res
or centered
it aint perfect
<:vzhub:943989139496386600>
renamedthe emoji to : hub :
also i beleive its the bot that posted it
i assume since you linked the yt account it shows on your pfp
your just sitting quietly fiddling with obs
hey <@!509772297289072653>  not sure if you're aware but the stream is on
whenever ur ready that is
awsome, send me his user and i can get it done
ez peasy
yup
Hehe pepe
Yea
Hello üëã
ah i see, ive got the malm iirc and some nice organisers ( not that i use them but when i have guests around i show them the organised drawers)
cool, ill add to announcements
someone sent a thingie that shows actual shipping times for vendors and reviews
no, check general
can we put that guys tracker in <#859133490041454592>
should work next time
np, its all finished now
its on private for a few minutes
dw
weird
the bot isnt working again
next time vez uploads we'll find out if its working
all fixed
was it me?
yeah, who added it
Cool üòé
Which channels does he view?
one has a infinite time all the others expire
do you think the spam users are from a inv someone made recently
kicked them too
all cleaned up i think
another spammer
Cause there's a few useful ones
Eek, can we block certain commands
Still scummy tho
I suppose those work for ht printers with a . metal x axis
true, i still suck at non verbal reasoning tho
Still interesting tho
The test was pretty much how do levers work and which way gears go.
morrisby test, career advice üòÑ
thank you so much <@!509772297289072653> . for the opportunities, the money and for the project
Do we reconsider their application or nah
That soy guys now a vendor with voron
thank you! i think ill invest it into trying to diy a hf nozzle
i dont think iamthesoy is soydude, unless they made a new acc, their message history is very friendly
i couldnt do better tho
well theyre very new, the website design reflects that
all of it, especially the naming
yup
does the pdf say signed by thrusday or am i illiterate
mayaswell sign it
cool
or has <@!509772297289072653>  already said
yeah shall i tell them we've opted to not add them
bruh chungus is the fat rabbit
yup
i might ask in annex what they think, noctus also applied there
the beta form doesnt mention cost
yeah
"thicc" and "big chungus"
you can almost guarantee the sit owner is gen z or a redditor
hm
this is noctus 3d, they wanna get added as a vendor
sure, one sec
i just need a foreign language and since half the test is in english and answered in english i figured it wuld be easier
ùò™ùòµ, ùò™ùòØ ùòßùò¢ùò§ùòµ ùò∏ùò¢ùò¥ *not*
im sure university will be this easy
we're just using them for bearings, the hardest subject is latin rn. math is pretty simple so far and science is a memeory game and common sense
its not too bad at m level
ohh the trigonometry
wait, the cool part?
<:kekw:906674564879233024>
thats just how they teach sin( cos( and tan(
sohacahtoa       or trigonometry
oh yeah üòé  learning about SOHCAHTOA, living the high life
cool, waiting for a response now, i think i missed them though, its been ~8hrs since they messaged me but i had cool people stuff to do
cheers
ü§¶  i forgot to do that
we just dont have mnay events to use it for
but otherwise i like the idea
nah just friends dicking around
dont mind the text but this is how the events work, you can also see whos interested
Yeah but do I need to ask any questions
What do I do with people who want to be vendors
GOTTA GET THAT MANUAL SPEED MEASURMENTS
<:wesmart:890660011531989072>
put your hand inside
<@!323961338412138497>  that bookmarker bot is pretty nifty. thanks for adding it
first plate printed
its an embed, try doing plain text for it and have the user type it
welp we have <@&909146406047068181>  <@&909149573677744138>  <@&909150169881255997>  if we ever need them
Nah we would hand it out to individuals, we can always ask in general if they want
+1 for electronics
we can hand out those roles after the ping
nah too many roles is confusing, rather we manually give them out
theres gona be alot of 'expert' roles so if you cover that one keep it non specific
sure thing, we have infinte roles i think
<@!795765716925546546>  do we @ the builders too or just owners
same difference
colour is subject to change
also heres the <@&909146406047068181>
how do we merge them, do we delete <#859133490041454592>  and move any important message to <#833394471457521694>  then rename <#833394471457521694>  to 'announcements'
sure thing then
im happy either way tho
sure, although i do like having a separeate page where every announcement gets collated and then a separate page for vzbot specifics
or 'engineering_expert'
lemme see how server profiles work, i have an idea. if not we just add roles for the clevers peoples e.g 'cnc_expert'
contributor is more for if something you designed gets integrated to the vzbot, i think we need a expert role
we can add a role labeled 'really wrinkly brained clever people' and give it to all the really clever people. or just a 'verified' role or alike that lets people know if theyve got a question those guys probably have the answer
damn thats big
whats that upgraded from
more smart people == more good
Thanks
just give me a heads up as far in advance as possible
ah shucks
Also did you see we now have scheduled events so if <@509772297289072653>  wants to we can make a scheduled event for when a new video drops. For hype and stuffs
Can I just add stuff to my cart and you get money or do I need to purchase it
tasty user data mmmm
yeah its hard to joke over text
no no, just didnt understand the statement on its own
agreed
wdym
I can't access that, mind copy ppasting the message
At least that's what I'm telling myself
For financial reasons
Then I'll comvert the cr10 to kipper
I need more stepper ports
I'm waiting for Gemini v2
sexy, maybe ill wait to build mine and order from one of you guys to get a full alu vzbot
Ah ok so with the same motor lgx is lighter
Also the vase i made is fairly watertight but I didn't optimise for water proof
Is it not heavier, 128 vs 110
and the flat faces mustnt have any obvious irregulartties, non flat, blobs or misaligned
image must use the harshest lighting possible for the flat faces
80% scale
the rose vase from thingiverse
ive got one in mind
it would only be valuable on power delivery except for ther fact that usbc is meant to be easily insertable and by extension removable
ah so its more faff than its worth
but while thats nice and all would it be sensible or is that chasing perfection where its not needed
that way nearly everything runs on one cable standard thats easy to buy
same for all the cooling
and for motors do the same, except its one cable with breakout wires
and the >250W power maximum to supply power
use the data delivery to control a huvud-esque board
if i wanted to reduce cable clutter, could i swap and other cables for a usbc
for the toolhead
is there any benefit to that
do you guys think its worth switching power delivery over to usbc and using the data transmission for a toolboard
Hey <@276016956245540864>  is there anyway to check the current highest serial via command or to manually assign a number
i dont think 48v heaters are a good idea, stick to whats standard and well used for heaters. but on the other hand i assume a higher voltage heater core would allow for more heat output. is there any safety concerns with 48v heaters
not sure how to link a comment
yt
yup
well well well, looks who's a bit of a tart
Although they are mass producing (kinda) the blocks vs nitrams make on demand
Low or high. I think that's quite low though
hehe got there in the end üò≤ üóø
C H O N K should also make printing easier
am i clap-backing right
I üëè  am üëè  the üëè  BBCüëè
or just not
also we could paste everyones face onto this paiting with adam (left) being the vzbot and god being vez and the surrounding being the mods
call me bbc for short
im the Broke Brexited Chap
i just gotta get around to learning cad and i can rank up
ah sick, also i like the title
i can potentially but gotta ask first, whens it 'due' by
ah cool
shall i ask hime to dm me his submission and ill post on his behalf
But should allow and image+text
I dont think pprint showcase should allow for text only
Yeah we gotta clean up the server, very cluttered, I can help do that later today
Should the print showcase be images only or allow text too
bruh, is it because you reached out to mellow and co about those motiuon kits
Cheers
oof they should not be sending full adress
agreed
I like the mustache
<@795765716925546546>  is that you in the pfp
But DW it was just my exact address, nothing important
Wdym that guy in the gif is way too old to be me
bruh i just doxxed myself
i wish i was rich enough to hire vez, olivier, albert and nitram, the admin team to build a super printer with a 10k budget
over 3k in discord alone
though that was $206 063
oh thank god
ah yeh thats scummy
which part, im not too well versed with printer beds
Is that bad?
if it goes high enough
or a tube from the top to reduce drag on the toolhead that blows air into a cylinder with a single inlet and a few holes on the other
CHUMPS
must be for
never heard of it
e.g
my friend sent a ton of vids, thats just one of them
nah just a render
Little do they know
Hehehe
Welp at least we got to see what it properly looks like
Cool, cool
<@509772297289072653>  is all that info still confidential or is it shareable
having a company want to fully produce high end kits for your project is pretty huge
wow thats insane, congrats
especially if its light and has large gears
i do have to amdit, that extruder looks veery smexy
all tidied up now
although bondtech may not mind
usually theyre quite strict about any leaks
are you sure you're meaqnt to be sharing that image
congrats to the both of you
holy shit thats awsome
üëã
Shall I lick the cap
<@451709396280410132>  this is pretty low power right
and one ink tube thing feels suspiciously light
this one is full of ink powder-y junk
i suppose that's why its soo heavy
ahh, there will be a lot of thick metal slabs inside
which parts are sheilding?
dw i got some nice thicc gloves and im avoiding any electronics until i can get a helping hand
<@451709396280410132>  look at this cool thing I found, I'm gonna cut it open and see what's inside
That would be pretty sick but nah just saw a local business tossing it out so I wheeled it down the hill to my houde
The touchscreen has a HDMI port. What are the chances it'll work with klipperscreen
Looksie what I got
hows this wording  'Which platform did you first hear about the VzBot from'
and for that
dont worry i wouldnt put that in anything official
shizzle
shall i send it
shhhh
yeah there it is
vzbot reasearch
or
vzbot feedback
title options?
one more, for asking where they heard about it or nah
alright ill send the form here first
<@&829874551084154911>  we happy wo make a google poll with these questions
alrigfht so we ask where they came from and why they chose the vzbot over others and which feature is their favourite (aesthetic or functional)
general with an @ owners and @ builders
shall i put one in announcements
and you can say that vzbot has manufacturers/resellers around the globe
also that spunds awsome
which company?
Oh yeah 225 will be good cause you can reuse ender 3 mods for it
and frame flexure
thats all i can think of
belt length, gantry weight, efficiency of money
got a lil worried for a sec
oh phew
Sus
nah must be some new thing
ü§®
Just one the user adds by reacting. I can set it up with Dyno or mee6
Could we get a young member role+channel
yeah in whi9ch case ill wait  abit
and they could always make more, unless this is a limited run in which  case ill buy now
they probably enter a random number there
You will be missed, but take your time. This server isn't going anywhere
lmao, the biggest flex
imagine being old enough to have those habits, cant legally relate
^
true, just slightly changed gearing and geometry
although everyone knows the others are from bondtech
dunno, he just has a good point, theyre all 'knockoffs' so to speak with only the hextrudort giving credit
@linmon raises a good point, their extruder lineup closely resembles bmg, bondtech smart QR and hextrudort extruders
lol i just put mine in a drill and used a dremel
16 tooth is more torque but lower top speed and 20 tooth is the opposite
and the toolchanger is pretty nifty
3k tho
its 13x heavier
and thats only the base
christ im 7% of that things weight
im afraid to ask for a banna scale, christ thats huge
like M4 or a different style
and get accepted
alright, once we apply we will announce it
ayyyyy, shall we put it in announcements or nah
but still a large lever, when it hits the bed its gonna crack in half
lever go brrr
ah
is weed legal over there?
ah lol, hes in netherlands iirc
yup
ah no worries, you can build and ill collect it and your wife never has to know   /s
hahahah, so smol but so C H O N K
was just gonna see if maze would forward it to albert since hes part way through reassembling the v0 last i checked
yup
ah, shame
looks pretty cool, is it v0 compatible or just same ff
or 4wd
making a cross xy?
Damn that's huge
Banana for scale?
315 people view the server each week
poggers
It'll be very cool, trust
Yes
Once I've got the printer I plan on pursuing a kat walk VR or alternative (VR treadmill) and haptic feedback gloves and then some base stations (for better tracking) and a VR ready pc
One of the most enjoyable parts of life
LoL, I guess it's time to go job hunting
I'm hoping to go 48v but I'll settle for 24
M8, I need this to be as durable as it gets
Ah cool. I can use most of the current build and get the bells and whistles on the new one
So all my XY rails will be used on z and so will the PSU and main board, but I'll still get a hv board
I plan on scraping the health hazard of a printer I've got in my room and reusing bits for the new one
Yup. Based of my minimum wage and a grueling 4 hr work week it'll take 28 weeks to fully finance the printer
Jeez. Would 600 cover a decent build with no abl otherwise similar spec to yours. I know there's no definitive answers but just a ballpark
How much was yours?
roughly how much is a good quality vzbot roughly
Well now, I'm no pro when it comes to electronics
He's a hackerman, destroyer of discord bots
yeah it is, text messages arent being deleted in <#832676300904464436>
i mean, i saw a guy using them as counterweights and using small flat plastic brackets to screw the top faces together. you could always make a giant counterweight
meaning i could print a fully working nozzle for PLA
lol, one of the filaments melts ata temp higher than what you print pla with
im of the opposite opinion as long as i can still see stuff i can afford flourish too. i wanna see the best of the best wizzing around a frame
Welp. Fair enough
weird
so theres no magic theyve put into that thing (other than r&d) thats making it cost so much?
nah youtube
hm, interesting
oh wait its already in there
looks good to me, just mention adding location info in the rules
does it mean, you could only use PETG on all trifurcated nozzles or only one material per nozzle
wont the coating make it slip out fairly easily
please make a vid of it working and of a cold pull if that woreks
oh sick,those look so weird
Also do the nozzles happen to be the 3 tracked/trifurcated nozzles
The veztruder
holy shit thats awsome, congrats man. with all this free stuff you could eventually build a  all sponsored vzbot
But once you get personal and emotional with the designs and product that idea doesn't work
More high quality budget printers drives price down and that's good for consumers
Everyone says more options=more good
if they rejoin just ban them
some nitro scam
just kicked @guolon and deleted his message
yikes, i do doubt that mellow would even care though
Ah no just remembered there was an announcement and couldn't see it so I checked the log to see if it was a bot
<@!509772297289072653>  was deleting all that on purpose or was that accidental
25CAD vs 2 GBP. jeez that conversion rate
two of them are mine and my nitro ran out yesterday, looks like we're gonna be one boost under lvl 1
Welcome back
enjoy
as long as theres no rubbing on those spacers which would melt them and wear them unevenly
is it just smoothed and prettied. been a while since ive seen the og design
sure
mhm
bruh
true, but assuming this turns out awful it just promotes odrive since theirs is quite good. on the other hand if its better then it may be a problem but it seems the kit is more expensive anyways
if odrive is cool with it could always send it to one of the admins üòâ  (for review)
/s for sarcasm, that shits nasty, no point drinking imo
/s
so youre saying i should have started drinking last year. dang it!
happy birthday!
ah cool
Just back from holiday. So I'm still catching up on everything, is there a tldr of the past 3 weeks
I can't do that on mobile
You gotta remove a webhook
I talked to the engineer guys
Didn't talk too much to Dan, my dad mostly talked businessness stuff with him
Dude slice engineering was super friendly. Even got a couple freebies. They had some very cool printers and we're mid designing something, couldn't tell what it was though
We have too many
Alright we gotta remove a certain announcement channel
I'll add them
üòä
About to visit slice engineering for a tour
Unless your psu is dropping during high speed and can ony supply one motor theres no reson to need or want to rotate to 45 on corexy, kinda the same for bedslingers unless you have separate x and y accel
I would think the pointy end would just redirect flow and the flat side would really get cooled better, not sure tho
Also congrats on 1k members
Have fun
Oof
Hopefully others will join with similar entries
Im back so ill try do a 'perfect' but slow print
Hey ill be on holiday for the next week. I might respond to a message or two but ill mostly be away
Guess ill be trying in this competition then
If the 2nd place has 2 printers maybe. If not perhaps its also for 1st place
sempetmer 1st or september 30th i think is good
winner has to be a not admin
yup
same, i just wanna enter for the fun of it
are admins allowed to enter the cube competition
Do we trust the server to be fine
Jinkies
sounds good to me
The second ones better. But yeah we gotta do a little self promos and shilling
the frame is a rotated x5sa
corexy mod for the ender 5
maze too, dont wanna put him on the spot but hes set  up a full motion kit on the zerog server
Haven't seen them in months
ooh that would be sick
so the second ones good imo
ah yeah thats good then, but i dont someone to win and the prize is meh because they dont need something from that store
depends how big the file is if we can send it if not i can toss it on a google drive and share through that
aliexpress coupons are more for large purchases, i think a item is better, but it should be a item of ¬£50 +-¬£5. imagine if we offered berd air as a prize and someone already had it. so winner can request a surprise or a set item near the winning amount of money. also for time length 3-5 weeks?
its iirc the smallest file type and like stl but good
most slicers do it
I think .12-.16   or .22-.26
Congrats
We made it past 700
Cool. Also I couldnt change the command thingy since its premium only
Also should I add the phrase 'saved one file' to the automod to be deleted
18 away from 600
Nice. Perhaps we could talk with voron amd do a mini promo there
Gn tho
Bold of you to assume I'm not just procrastinating
Alright in 8hrs ill get to it
<@451709396280410132>
Ah shiz. Is it urgent
Yup
By manually scrolling through
Im not manually scrubbing through the server again
Bruh
Dunno
<@!323961338412138497>
Theres every stl/cad file ever uploaded
No prob
And move printer showcase to a community content section
Ill go through the server tnght and find all the mods and post them here and we can decide whats a official mod and what's community
nice
ah hes already got it
or do you guys wanna? also which role am i offering
ill ask hime
contributor? or like voron the crew?
nah biggus brainus is perfect /s
we can call it 'big brainers' and they can be in pink
id say at least designer
sure, he designed the alum gantry right
Pog, then we gotta get community engagement up but the competition should dot hat. Should we set up a competition channel for any 3d printing related channels to be posted into
Especially without extensive tuning on klipper
Tbf, nitrams e3 was in around 18/16min but i dont think a cr10 would do it
Its just annoying, the guy is great, he makes clear guides and soydude isnt exactly doing better than him. Either way its his opinion so eh
Oh no beer is for watching the fire and sip on
Acetone or lighter fluid does the trick, even cheap beer
Silly billy, do it outside and around the corner so no one sees, and use ipa for more fun
Man you want the guy with a fire hazard in his bedroom watching young children. I mean, what could go wrong?
Ahh, just clicked
Huh? I mean im getting a summer job so i can buy stuffs
And its all with the power of child labour
Guess whos finaly gona be able to build a vzbot, custom board laser engraved panels, possibly water cooling and definetly berd air with rscs
If they would most enjoy a: lightweight carriage; high flow hotend or hevacs style cooling duct competition with the cash prize being 50 for first and 25 for second and 3rd
Ah well that too
If not we can link a google froms thing everywhere
Sounds good to me
We'll keep server fires to a minimum /s
Enjoy
Damn. 100 bucks, you sure about that. I was thinking if it was a hotend then we get mellow involved to machine it and send it to first and second place. Or if its a aesthetic thing they get a performance upgrade kit. If itd a cooling thing they get it printed out for them
Are we talking z options
Lol same
Eh im fairly chill, unless he starts tossing slurs or doing shady stuff its all good
Ah cool, all good then
Oh huh, ill go see how he was there, i dont want to do preventitive bans so i can issue him a warning then temp ban then full ban. I just dont like fully removing people
Although he was trash talking the vzbot and upping voron despite proof their printer isnt good for our application (wonderful for what its designed for)
If hes getting removed would we mind waiting til hes given me some pointers on the vape, otherwise dont mind him. Makes a lot of claims but no evidence yet (was discussisng his 60s potential benchy) but i dont think theres too much wrong with him. How come?
And a small plug in the next vid for community server, and we'll all have to decide on what competition to do to boost server engagement
Server settings ---> moderation---> 2fa for moderation
But nothing too soon, he can take his time for the next vid
Also we need a more active communtiy, and 49 more members
Just for us
And enable the 2fa thing
I dont mind doing it, just wanted to know if i should enable it
But alsoif my duct is twice as good as urs and fans scale linearly in output and sound, i could run my fan at half the volume as yours at the same output
Dang it I missed my chance to say, if <@509772297289072653> builds that cooling thingy, then a nozzle competition, make modular magnetic nozzles and users send the stl and he runs the exact same print and we hold a vote at the end on which has the best cooling
Oh yeah price to performance and weight thrn
And material
All sounds good to me. We would have to havr certain criteria for weight size and cost
That sounds reasonable, how would you test them though
Inly when you click on it is it squared
Hrmph
I had to go get my phone to msg
On my crappy pc it takes 10m to boot up
you suck
Click off the server and checl again
Its already a circle
Away it goes
Fair enough
May aswell have a questionarre though, wasnt my idea though
Nope
Oi, just saw that response
Either today has been a long day or thats just a collection of words with no meaning
Heres the quick sheet i made, lmk if its good bad or needs something added <@&829874551084154911>
Currently on mbile so maybe different but mines constantly animated
Weird
Try disable the gif one
I dont like automation anyways so i should be fine
Yeah in the event i get banned (should be unlikely) im just gonna rejoin and let you guys know its me, tbf if i forget to join a server its probably not important
Yup, color change mostly and the google translate option
<@!509772297289072653>
We can get a bot for that i think, or do it manually
Check out external announcements, anytime one of the mentioned channels makes a announcment it shows up here
On mobile it constantly rotated
Do you have minimise animations enabled
Also if anyone has any other good servers for me to add to external announcments just let me know
Yup, no black bars, try add it
Fairly certain, may aswell try it, but also yeah cropping
Should we make thw <#833394471457521694>. Into a actual announcements channel (different icon and allows servers to 'follow' updatea
Its currently good. But I dont want to add many more channels so if we do vendors I wanna try rearrange the server a bit
Finding ino here should be quick anf easy
Sure.but I dont want this discord to end up with hundreds of empty channels
Possibly. Iirc mellow sells it too
Well I can't promote him, I think only vez can, what's everyone else say?
True. Are we ablw to promote him
Perhaps mellow would like to
Im thinking of building a vzbot next and im happy to have it as a test rig, so i get it all pretty looking with acrylic panels and led lighting and all that noise and would be happy to throw anything on it and review it from the point of a average user with a limited knowledge base, obviously vez or whoever else mayy want to review things instead and either works for me, but if we could get a giveway that would awsome
Giveaway would skyrocket the amount of users, especially if they have to send a message in a channel
Whats the gold role?
Thankfully not, hardened steel tho so hopefully undamaged
cartographer went haywire!
i have some repairs to do üíÄ
onetwo3d.co.uk/product/double-sided-pei-steel-sheet-for-vzbot/
anyone have expirience with their sheets?
also which version of the beacon fits the toolhead
ah missed that, if you ever change your mind give me an @, just dm'ed you my nearest tube station
im running alu rn
hey <@230349339434811392>  do you want my cf beam
Ooh thanks
time for me to buy a new screwdriver, my old kit was 
But my chamber gets warm
I've been hitting mine with 90% CPAP and it's calm
Oh smart , I'll have a look
ooh i forgot to check that
i gotta chekc its not m3
its quite worrying cause i dont own any m2.5 hardware other than the pritner
i did look but couldnt find anything
what parts about the printer use that
looks to be m2.5
I don't know where it's from
Oh no
oh gotcha, ill try the same print at varying line widths then
why is that
really? i wouldve thought opposite since flow restrictions
0.16 Vs .3
Only difference is layer height
Same profile for both
Not a great example but you can see it doesn't happen here
It seems to happen on small objects only
Still not up to speed but decent quality
That's what I thought but I've been getting some fairly clean prints recently too
What causes this kind of artifacting
Dealing with a pesky spacer now, the motor spacer just refuses to stay in place
Finally unstuck
That did it
Same for the other side and it's stuck
On one side I loosen the three screws and the thumbsrew and it moves freely
I can't get it fully loose
Something is up with one of my tensioners
Which part of the docs shows the build
I think I've built one of my tensioners wrong
Awesome
I forgot I had some printed, how do they mount?
Thank you
Yeah hang on I'm taking a lunch break but I'll video it
Already done that too
So I've removed all tension and it won't go bacm
It got un squared when one belt came out mid print and the other belt pulled it skew
How do I adjust it
So if my gantry is really off square
Thank you
Nah I've got them disabled, I'll just go back and forth til I get them close
I'll be back
Hmm
Hm
Will tightening one change the other
ü´°
3 screws total?
Brb
ü§¶ü§¶
The ones up top of the plate, yeah
I've over tensioned one and turning the thumbscrew the other way just loosens it and doesn't move the motor
How do you loosen a belt
"Section 'gcode_shell_command delete_old_raw_data' is not a valid config section "
i started installing klippain and realised i only want shake&tune so started un installing and it did a terrible job of restoring everything. fixed a couple missing cfg's and now ive got this error which i dont now how to fix
cool
ah so mine arent that bad
How hot should my steppers be gettting
ill work more on getting it up to speed
no clue why PLA doesnt go nicely but at 270c and 250mm/s its good nough quality
also, ive been printing in ABS and getting some nice results
happens at most startups even if there were no previous errors ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
why would it happen at sartup tho and be fixed by a firmware restart
maybe not the most reliable
thank you, i think what i have rn is the free microcenter 128gb thumbdrive
could be, but it happens on startup too. im going to try using some actual good storage before trying that
i have a USB hdd but i imagine a hard shutdown wouldnt be good for it
ive had mine die twice now and im just gonna spend the money and do it right
hey <@451709396280410132> what do you reccomend for the best Pi storage
its died
shit its my usb i was booting from
Usb SSD is the best solution to that right?
Maybe it's a storage issue again
Ugh now the pi isn't booting
its on the mcu so presumably not the Pi
ive been getting them at startup but ignored it for the most part
dang it
got a timer too close error mid print
the kit ships with a 0.5mm nozzle right?
ah awesome, thank you Rac
My rscs mellow kit won't spin up below anything but 100% is that normal?
how do i create a construction line/dimension between these two parts, i need to place the two ends at points offset from the parts
fair
mb, meaant the internal 22mm length
hey <@163132418776236032>  before i go make a cutting jig, does the mellow kit come with the ptfe tube cut to length?
cheers
dang
even without the 35mm
does your fan holder wobble much, mines missing the slot so im not sure if i need to tighten it or if its because the slots not there
lovely üòé
reckon i could skip them?
ill have to order those off amazon
darn
i cant find any long enough
what length screws are used to connect the long golaith duct to the tool-head
odd how theres no slot tho
phewwww
Will button head work
I don't have any long ulp üò≠
nah theres no slot
Should there be a groove machined here, my m3x6 screws don't reach through the fan holder
ill prob do a spray dry ptfe through those lube ports
the rails dont slide at all now
ah, if i ever regrease ill go for a thinner lube anyways
ah well, i dont have a needle that small anyways
ah i see it
wait what
yup üòé  ive got two complete, just dont wanna fuck the cf tube
so im using a medicine syringe to shove it in via a screw hole on the rail
ive got some thiccc ep2 grease
im just following LDO advice ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
ah sick i got everything needed
i gotta lube them rails
is there any special way to disassemble and reassemble the cf x gantry
like this dawg
No cleaning makes my life significantly easier
I'll do like ldo recommends and shove it in via a screw hole to grease the carriage
Aight
ive got a dry ptfe lube i can spray?
do the ldo rails in the kit need greasing or are they okay as is
Ep2 white lithium
is white lithium grease suitable for all moving parts, the linear rails/rods and leadscrew?
Cheers
I guess I saw the previous version in photos
Ahh is only one side threaded
The only pic I could see was from a vz235 which had two sides of the thingy threaded
So I kinda guessed which way was right side up
I couldn't find a good pic of the assembly
Well I'm not sure
Time to get the grease
Mb
Ah yup just did that and fixed it
Oopsies, what's assembled wrong, it jitters when moving down
where do i find this in the 330 kit?
no way thats right
the bottom just hangs and slide freely
i think i built the oldham wrong?
i think im being slow again, but what do i do f my leadscrew is binding on one side only
It's been a long day (it's 10am)
The alignment tool goes on the front and the rods butt up to it
ü§¶
That might be my issue
Ah
They don't reach both rods
How do you use the z alignment bracket with the mellow CNC vz330 kit
But none have holes
I see 4 460mm extrusion
Am I blind or is the 460mm extrusion with two holes missing
if youre worried chuck down a brim and come check on it every hour or so
it only probes around the object im printing in a denser mesh
<@287357528780570625>  this is what i run for my start macro
even if you just run that macro independently
funky stuff
not always?
that gcode looks fine, whats your startup gcode set in superslicer
just means more kits for the rest of us üéâ
either way you can just let mellow know you arent interested anymore, but hes only messaging people from the form
or someone else filled it out in your name
you might have filled it out a while ago
therer was a form to fill out in <#864089371188002836>  to say if you wanted a kit, it should be in the pinned messages
My Cartesian is handling it with PA though i only go up to 100mm/s
i cant remeber exactly what causes that 2nd hump tho
only thing id bother about is the second lower peak on x, that might be a cable or smthing. if you wach the test around 100hz you might see it moving
it is heavier so the y axis will probably have a lower freq, the lighter toolhead will have a lower freq
The hurikan?
Ender 5 I guess but it's not corexy
Really eithers fine
But the 3a is acceptable for normal use
Vez was using 2.8 and that was plenty for 2500mm/s
If you can afford it I'd get the 6A for some safety headroom
i guess it defaults to lagrange then, yeah it goes in that section of the config
would fix it
i think interpolation: bicubic
change the interpolation method
nope you can go higher on klipper, i know the beacon probe does 100x100
Ick ü§¢, one off balance washing machine and a wire comes loose and now it's smoldering
Yeah ferrules are fantastic for heaters, and it's downright dangerous without
Once I get home I gotchu
Ferrule for sure, got a crimper and 500 for 15 on ebay
the role colours?
hm, i havent tried a volcomosq but if youve got enlarged sections in the filament, might be a gap somewhere?
try some cold pulls and see if it fixes itself?
hm
ah
1.8mm at 40mm/s is perfect on my machine
what retraction length?
and pla is the most prone to it
the v6 heatsink clogs rather easily
plus
nah i run mine fine enough, PLA is very runny though so retracting it in a volcano (long meltzone) is difficult
i cant remebr the difference now
i thought k1 was that sized
ah 400, not 40. i suppose it would still work
your rails would be huge next to the bed
mm?
yeh thats what holds it shut
No problem
usually just whenever one of the mods gets round to it, sorry i missed yours. ill get it now
did you set it to a calxulated number, or based off the filament test
when you say esteps calibrated
is your nozzle size set correctly in klipper?
and slicer doesnt show it?
hm
what line width, also i assume you rechecked flow/ esteps (if you tune per filamen)
eithers good with me
awesome, you wanna buy the label and send to me to keep your address private, or end my your address and ill buy it and you just paypal me the 1.50?
1.50 for the whole thing, royal mail 2nd class. or 2.70 for 1st class
ive got no good suggestion, but how come?
screws and washers did fine
yeah i found with a probe using the springs was unnesescary
use the bltouch to get an idea of the beds slant and use washers to adjust if its a solid mount?
worked for 3 months before i realised my lanyard holder already arrived and was put into my parts drawer üòÜ
otherwise a bandaid solution is string and a weight draped over a pulley
where are you in the uk, i can ship you one probably faster than ali. just pay cost+shipping?
as long as the wire is above it shouldnt matter, can always install one at the base/lower down and then run it over a pulley
id imagine it works at any angle (or two from opposit angles) so really anywhere you can anchor it. just use some string/rubber band to stop it rattling arund
with how cheap they are it doesnt matter, but with the speeds i pull i cant imagine it breaking
no exact tracking but its been just under a year of near daily use
they are called retractable lanyard holders, can be bought on ali for ~¬£0.2. ive had this on hear for well over 100 hours by now
got the idea after seeing joshmurrah and his vorons gantry suspended by a similar item
works at all heights, speeds and positions
<@426492927108186132> <@753687059331416106>
sure gimme a sec
but still suspended
so they can both move freely
i run mine through a retractable lanyard holder
cheers
or just more accel
is there a certain colur filament
how do i make it more pronounced
if ringing isnt pronounced enough for manual inout shapr tuning
Shouldn't make much difference afaik
Lower pitch right? So more turns per mm?
You can check its smooth on some my seeing how much weight it needs to drop when powered off
Also what printer
<@504027227718156288>  try a print unheated. Also whens the last time you lubed the leadscrew?
Also also check the hotend isn't wobbly. Just try pushing the nozzle
<@504027227718156288> do a probe repeatability test, also How'd the unheated test go
Iirc CNC kitchen covered it in a vid
Not accuracy but stability. If the bed is warping with the temp change and your temp is fluctuating by a degree or two then it might be lower and raising the print just enough to create z banding
checked bed PID tune?
wonderful for L shapes, U shapes etc.
yeah sorry, dont do it for squares
because i needed to remove one 2020
had to disassemble entire frame
yeah i have them installed
even the steel corner brackets on the utside are easier
but those larger angled brackets you can print are uch better
you coould add some to get it a little more ridgid
i spent too long suffering through those
NO
smooth idlers arent for use when the belt teeth willbe touching the idler
Yeah, they're pretty much the same but that twisted shape is best
Config file, DIY it but copy bits off other people. The flashigh klipper to the board, DIY but follow the docs as there's not much variation
Wdym?
perhaps we should have a thread in <#994309835216650321> called NoStupidQuestions thats just a permananet thread
we've all been noobs at some point
oh i see
Who's name? The catpirate guy?
Ah, that's makes sense
I go through 1 or two kilos a month
Bruh
does it have same/similar plugins to better discord
i use it for ÔΩîÔΩàÔΩÖ„ÄÄ“ì·¥è Ä·¥ç·¥Ä·¥õ·¥õ…™…¥…¢ oPtIoNs
np
with betterdiscord you can get themes to change the backround and colours
It's personal preference, if you don't get ringing with it then you can, but if there's too much for your liking then you can turn jt down
I don't have any numbers but it'll probably make some difference
The more the merrier
The printed brackets work fine, I'd recommend them
I have them in my frame. Took absolutely ages to add and didn't do much for stiffness, you can put them in a couple corners if you must but nearly any other bracket would be better
I would just check with something else you know is flat that the bed truely is flat and not a proper taco. I'd also look to see if a local makerspace has a proper flat surface
Probably, but I'd worry about breaking it. I know nero3d got his from a kitchen countertop company for really cheap since he asked for offcuts
Not sure if I'm thinking wrong but I think that's to minimize vibration. Suddenly stopping sends energy to the frame. Suddenly starting just adds energy to moving bits and won't make much vibrations . So klipper defaults to that for better quality but a lot of machines can live with the two being that same.    

I think ü§î
Most just leave them both at the same value
Accel is the start of the move. Accel to decel in the end of the move
A 40mm LSD might maybe be in your price range but it's not a combo and it won't be out super soon
It won't be fantastic but it will be cheap
If you don't need a combo then you could add a jacket to most hotends to water cool it
Its not fantastic, cause titan, but it's watercoolable
Titan aqua is the cheapest I know of
wait theres a beta?
the lightweight gantry is what makes it able to hit higher speeds
im 80% sure the heater is a custom made/bought heater
I'm fairly certain there's a calculator for it that'll tell you the step rate for a given speed
The thing to look at is step rate which klipper has benchmarks available for
Well. Kinda. I'm sure a zero w could handle 128 microsteps at 5mm/s
If you aren't pushing crazy speeds and you have a higher spec raspi and motherboard you can raise microstepping really high
Sometimes the entire vzbot feels like a extended Weiner joke
I just hope it's bare and not anodized üòâ
I just want the vez3d calendar. Photos of vez posing with his printer
Huh, looks like it won't work on 2209
When you tune the sensitivity you're gonna crash a lot. Unless you mean like the cr6 se which uses a strain guage
Possible. But not recommend
Works for me
Uses linear rials and the vzbot xy pieces?
Sounds fine for me
Got a rough render or CAD?
And if I can squint really hard and mistake jt for a vzbot then it's probably fine
If the XY gantry is close enough it's fine
cool
if you want i can make a small test peice
üëç
the whole part or a test peice?
thats from the solid top surface, id maybe look at perimeters on top layers, top layer flow and maybe outer perimters first  . try a model with two towers then a top layer half way up and all those settings changed
Same <:hehe:926257385285226546> <:hehe:926257385285226546>
But I'm all ears
I've no clue how to go about that
We can do that
grid it is, unfortanutelty cnckitchen didnt cover a bendin or twisting force
no no, like if you held a sheet and tried to flex it. i want it stronger in the sense it wont bow out under pressure
gyroid gives quite easily
trying to print a large gear like this with the infill exposed, what pattern would be least flexible
all added
any others?
superslicer, prusaslicer, ideamaker and cura
ill add
Woulda kinematic mount remove some of the expansion concerns
Have you thought of cooling the steppers
I meant the idler sorry and the motor mounts
<@503624863479627777> I recall seeing a all metal vz235 but I'm not sure if it was available for purchase or just a custom job. But I think with enough money it would definitely be possible
Ah well, it'll probably be good enough, plastic extrusoon isn't that precise anyways
here you go
lemme find the invite
oh my bad you might not be in the annex server
interesting data
oh that too
pi cam also needs that hdmi converter
Awesome üëç
Hot glue would probably be okay tbh but I think I saw a focus mod that allowed for a wide angle lens too
Oh yeah, do you have a photo of what the image looks like
I don't think undervoltijg Any fan is bad other than maglev (I think)
Also use RTD silicone if you have to mount it. What would the hole be for anyways?
Wattage is the important part
Clip it on and away you go
Consider a wide angle fisheye lens for iphones
possibly, i havent looked into it a ton but i know voron uses it on startup to change the lcd colours
delayed gcode might also work if thats a route you want to explore
What printer
Hm
So that the bed is on the hotend and vice versa
And maybe try swap the bed and hotend heater ports
Wiring is good?
funky, does it heat normally if you do it manually (post print) and does the gcode look normal
From top of cylinder to bottom
Motor length
ahhh, for a second i thought you meant the gantry. it probably shouldnt wobble but that may be from the leadscrews if the wobble is repeatable
bed? wobbling in the y axis direction?
if its rollers they can be adjusted
but generally wobble=bad especially if its a linear rail
my friends ender 3 did until he tightened the wheels
my cr10s pro doesnt but its got v slot rollers on two extrusions
which printer
No need to configure anything iirc and you can put it into either
But it can definitely go in the motherboard and screen
Not sure if it can go in the pi
The btt tft 3.5 has a USB port and you can print from it
You can stick a USB stick with gcode on it in and it'll work
And USB if your tft/Mobo supports it
Yup
Also, how'd it bend <@300142630216400896>
Be polite and just ask can they replace or advise
No reason to try bending before talking to slice
Contact slice
Lemme do some googling
If it's not much effort mayas well soak it for a couple hours
I think they put it on, I'm not sure tbh
Iirc you use water to dissolve boron nitride, might be worth trying
Did u put boron nitride on it
theres a certain wantai model thats good too but i cant find it
e3d whoppers are pretty good
np
<@!209767145582624768>
this one?
i wasa told spade crimp thingys were best but bare wire also works its just veeery sketchy
also those flat corner brackets are apparently quite good (havent tried them on my printer)
also (may be wrong) but ive been told to get steel brackets since theyre cheaper and better
go for something larger, the printed ones will probably be better than those
anything below is dubious for long term
but ive gone down to .4 to .8 safely
true
but in a pinch i just turn down the line width
yeah i always have to redesign parts cause i forgot nozzle size
and looks good
it all goes well
i use a .6mm defualt on my 410x410 bed. even tho my parts are usually very small. i just like the ability to print anywhere from 0.16mm to 3.2mm layers without any issues
and do it in a day
just buy a 1.2mm nozzle
for the beer or for the crate?
Took my a week to figure out where the dust was coming from
At least you didn't do flow testing in black filament so all the flakes are invisible inside the extruder and very apparent on the white carpet
lemme go play a song and upload a vid, while were on the topic may aswelll do a little flexing
ah cool, cuz that accuracy is considered god teir
do you play?
and challenge being nerar impossible
tech being those awkward to hit angles
thats a tech+challenge map
wanna see something really easy
and hes slated to be #1 late 2022
currently the #3  worlds best player is 12
surprisingly their more a acc player so they play ''slower'' songs and aim for getting a super high score
Got my hopes up for a second
<@265629116106145793>  you don't happen to play beatsaber do you?
ah then u could definitely push scv
but you can push scv
8 corner 420mm/s and 15k accel
usongshine is good from what ive heard
rsci.com/a10-timing-belting these belts
maybe just 100100
minimum 8080
24v super speed
or with enough effort you could get 14 total steppers for motion, plus 1-2 for extrusion
like tycho
i could figure it out but just pulling on bits of the belt around the frame will be quickest
np
just @you and the guy on the server
do you want a invite
theres a discord where you can message the guy
if its anything like prusaslicer theres machine limits, you can change those to be used only for estimation or to be ignored
which slicer?
heres the back idler with a motor on it
heres the 4 motor hevort
for the vzbot, not yet. for the hevort (and probably others that i dont know of) yes
the front idlers become motor mounts
gain troque and loose a bit of speed
yes, 4 motors instead of 2
ah meant crossxy. in annex engineering theyve built the k1/2/3 which features a crossed gantry which keeps weight low and belts short
for those sizes a cross zy will be better or a ender 5 style gantry
that is sadly true
well its got a face cam
try guess who the next one is
mid print plug it in and away i goes at ~120mm/s on every axis (or at least as fast as firmware allowed )
it was having a computer connected
guess what
i spent days troubleshooting why one specific print made the printer hoot to max z x and y and just start shooting out filament as fast as possible
this is my favourite
nah just things from the internet
theres more
drop
f3d website,  check out the pins in <#922245405293563924>
when you move the z theres no visible wobble? and the vslot rollers are concentric
ah fine, as long as theres one easily accessible
on
yes
fair enough, although having a backup is invaluable
wheres it going? but yeah start gcode is fine then
and then use the save to eeprom command
with pronterface
can you not send the command via gcode
and make sure to save those settings afterwards
15 max
reboot router maybe?
use angry ip
and chech the ip address hasnt changed
restart
on wifi or wired
ah if the group is under 50 it wont be shown
same for discord
wow the US is pretty high on the list, i thought theyd be much lower
yooo im a .6% percenter
i always default to x and y but that also messes with people
but i agree with rac the b variant you showed is easier
i think they thought you meant b type aluinum extrusions
whats the age like?
its one of those things that makes sense to the maker since they know what goes in but when you look at it fresh its a little confusing
linear rods and bearings for the things to the left and right of the leadscrew
brass nut
yup
purchase an extender and make life easier
i personally like fluidd msot but both are similar
install both with kiuah (kiuah installs with a few commands) and see which you prefer
if youve got fluidd, then other than for the first flashing (and maybe for other updates depending on wether your board supports USB FLASHING) you wont need acces
and tried to use coolstep which i never got working
just mentioned since i went down a rabbit hole of trying to implement jam detection with stallguard
youll be able to home faster with slighlty less wear
if its already there you mayaswell use the stops
quick mention: its only for x and y, not z and e
but you set a certain threshold that doesnt trigger during moves and when the stepper hits the edge it knows and does the same as hitting an endstop
but i know theres a formula you can follow or just trial and error
gonna be honest, i cant tell you the in and outs of sensorless homing
i love it, saves wiring
hopefully this makes it clearer
dw im finding a good guide
what board are you using
uart allows you to use sensorless if you want it
it goes both ways
alright ypu may have to remove the diag pin, im not too clear on NOT using tbh
skr pro v1.2
yup, and make sure your driver has the physical pins for sensorless homing
yeah it took me so long to find that out
yes you want it, uart gives you all the smart features
nope, those go to the board
input shaper allows for higher speed and reduces vibrations
a accelerometer to tune input shaper
yup, im not sure how adxl connects though
may as well try it out, if you've got the know how and its got the right I/O
assuming thats cheaper than a pi
if youre able to pick up a old office computer and install linux and do some computer wizardry you can run it on that
ah cool
what country?
ah cool, all the listing i saw were listing  a retail of over 100 usd, figured you had to get it from something inustrial for free
rms is (0.707x2.8)x0.8=1.58 which is within the 2209s capability
with cooling*
where'd you get these from?
this isnt the exact model but its the closest i could get
lemme search those up
when i say amps are irrelevant its only in finding the correct pulley size, the driver is 2amp RMS and is that 2.8A the max current or RMS current
so rather using the external mount for nema23 you can buy a kit of pulleys and test them by gearing down with a x teeth:20 teeth
but since the vzbot is designed around the 20t pulley if you go bigger or smaller then itll throw the belt alignment off
its all a balancing act
if you need speed and have high torque motors then a 20+ tooth pulley is great but if you want minimal vfa and need the most torque on the belt then a 16 tooth pulley is good
well amps are a little irrelevant (kinda), you can assume theyre high torque and assuming your driver has good microstepping accuracy is mostly a moot point since extrusion adds the most variation
Or buy a clone BMG and gut it
Yup
i think its a split between the two
have you seen some of the later sneek peaks?
natively ive tried up to 64 microsteps, but interpolation ups it significantly, i remember annex engineering discussing about the best practices for stepper settings- ill find it later- but i think they reccomended against stealthchop (which isnt interpolation)
full explanation- it does as you suggest and takes a set of 16 microsteps and does some processing and estimates 256 microsteps
you always natively run more micro steps if you feel like it (up to 128)
not sure how but it does
interpolation magic ups more microsteps
whatcha trying to make
tinkercad to cut one hole straight through the part
assuming you can drill new holes or just cut your own holes in cad
if you notice artifacting, upgrade. otherwise is fine
depends o budget, e3d/gates ones are meant to be nice but an amzon pack of 7 will still work
tldr just buy some gt2 belts from mellow and get some nice pulleys. gt3 is fairly similar
GT3 belt has a virtually identical performance as the GT2.
or overhang settings
gonna have to use a settings modifier for the one ayer
set to 90 degree aligned lines
very tragic
do you have a link to it
make sure voltage is 5.1-5.2v if you use the sd card
Sorry forgot the /s in there
That sucks
Aw shucks not new steppers
check the wires are securely plugged and that the wire isnt failing, otherwise new motor
Not much we can do
It is what it is
Yeah vez takes one down and two more arrive
raspi3b or zero 2 are good choices depending on what you need
so tmc2130 or drv8825 are probbaly best but im not sure
2130 can do 46 max
2209 does lower voltage
this is the cheapest 35v i kinow of but thats not at the 48v that i can near guaramtee working
nah sorry
probably need 48v and a ras pi with a supernova or something similar
not gonna cut it unfortanutely
could just reorient a k3 or vzbots xy
and how big is your x y
how heavy is your gantry
made from a ender 3
alright, so iirc <@!448202437808095232>  built something similar
alright, that makes sense, and do you want it to be corexy or corexz
theres 2 way to do this
and how much custom cad-ing can you do
how much moddding do you want to do
They're external right
so with a gearing of 1:1
unless you do it all non dd
swapping will be humongously painful
<:kekw:906674564879233024>
when you finish it
youll have to tell us
<:wesmart:890660011531989072>
half the fun is losing the braincells
nop
you could probably gear them 1:1.5 or 1:2
they might not be the fastest tho with their high rotor inertia
depending on their torque you could gear them down for higher speed
that could work
not 100% sure for klipper
yup
but again, keep 400mm/s for travels and increase accel at lower speeds for actual parts. high top speed isnt the most useful unless you print squares
yeah thats solid
also consider when would you use 300mm/s, you might be better off at 250 or 200 and higher acceleration
hows it now
ah overtightened
sounds about right for testing
<@!323437724965273601> how're you testing and are you prioriting max speed or accel
ah cool, and it sounds better now
did it fix itself?
and maybe try 32 mcroste[s
try 1.40A
1.78 is over the max limit by a teensy bit tho
no, heats the only damaging part to running high amps (within reason)
im taking a look now
yup
ah, hm, mid linking the config
you might have your config wrong unless that was a mistype
sounds right to me
That's probably the best option, some u channel cuts at 4 or so points
Also what steppers are you using
Are you calculating RMS correctly
Loose. The belts and win by hand and feel for am irregularities
If it's a clicking or scraping I would check the bearings
good luck
maybe try 40
but its not a great fan
i run 70%
it may need a bit more
ah whats cooling like?
or possibly a wider line thickness in the bottom layer
ah consider a bed adhesive
where it touches the bed?
yup, wheres the warping?
same side profile with top and bottom
mind getting  a sharper photo of that left corner
i got that one too, prints beatifully
ah is it seaparating there?
the boogers are at infill desnity changes and overhangs mostly, makes sense since the abs+ is meant to be a little melty and doesnt cool well
doesnt look bad, thats the tree green right
im on a volcano, all metal. but most reccomend a nf crazy mosquito
somoenes fallen asleep at the keeb
oopsie
depending on your country theres a few people
those are macros to add to ur config
no problem, if you have any further questions feel free to ask here
for pricing its just different reccomended parts
vzbot has less documentation whereas vorons is very in depth
the vzbot (if 48v) will have 2 psu instead of one like voron
the amount of options can be overwhelming though whereas voron has simple sets of combinations
the vzbot frame should align easier and the z assembly shuld be easier to build
well it depends, some aspects are easier but some are harder
yup, some people have higher speeed sas their base outer speed, if built right and tuned properly you should be able to get good quality at that speed
maybe a super cheap drop in upgrade for a hf ender being a microswiss knockoff and cheap volcano block
you could but i see no reason to
and can always be reused for sherpa
and the bmg is a ok to use
mosquito is better
yes, the vzbot is corexy
probably a eva backplate except a corexy edition then a lgx lite or sherpa and a dragon hf/v6/rapido/quick change v6
may i ask why mgn12 for the x
or overextrusion
too close on the first layer
did it jest bend when you removed it
which part, the bead pattern or the massie warp
you can change the min/max on the endstop and also invert the dir pin
lulzbot is cartesian, so wouldnt be switched xy i dont think
you might have the endstop direction wrong
in <#841383576398200892>  you react to a message there
would you like me to remove it
i beleive you gave it to yourself with the react thingy, i cant remeber how we give them out
Buy some steel corner plates and do it right
I did something similar and it's not worth it, huge pain to assemble with and they don't add much rigidity
<:this:906674932509978624>
BUT quality will vary and depending on what tools you have and the overall cost building a frame diy may be smarter
I'll mention you can buy returned tronxys from the source heavily discounted
Otherwise, no
Thicker walls means heavier tube
worth it
really really
same, that sounds
Ask here, most of us have been through the ringer and can help
Klipper and personaling the confid
and skipping
yup
best way it to run a speed test and slowly ramp up scv by 5
an inbetween
IM ON 25RN
yeah but rule of thumb is m3x8
but my rails were pretty awful
i used m3x12 and they were mostly fine apart from one spot where it hit the frame
those are m3x12 iirc
drag chain for z or strain relief i think but not sure
we only have wood screws here and only one shitty brand
also i dont think me parents would be all too happy carting me off to europe to aupair
And other than small business or online that's the only diy seller
Hahahahah, b&q (home Depot equiv) has fuck all in terms of useful equipment that isn't for gardening
Oh bruh. Your kids speak more languages than me
ah shucks
near florida?
do your kids speak english?
which country you in, if you dont mind me asking
xy is very very subjective in quality and any issue would impact it, e.g belt teeth or slight ringing
in which case i wouldnt trust their results
i think they mean on xy
yep, fully stress tests the motion
if your board accepts separate input for bed then you could use a step down before the inlet for the bed or a 12v supply
sounds like i need to transfer school, why'd they give it to you
sorry
beats me
a spectrometer on your phone to measure and i think the tightener is on the toolhead
eyyyyyy
also, why not
community deserves it, all my knowledge comes from here and a couple other servers
yup, i rarely spend so nows the time to do it, first thing im doing is buying some stuffs for a giveaway here and a couple other places then a printer for me
and ive got plenty saved now
but thats over the course of a year or two
i plan on buying maybe 1 or 2 big ticket items (triple digit) and 3 double digit items
i dont spend much money otherwise and ill only be 15 once
yeah, ive got nothing else to spend it on and i mayaswell
im still 15 so i can funnel all my money into printers and im gettinfg a job specifically for buying ]3d printer stuff
*xy 2 pro
nah nvm pro is ender 3 style
im not sure
x5sa is the usual one but is the pro also compatible?
which of these are vzbot compatible
fr4 is like metal in the sense it doesnt ignite
nah dont worry, same way wood can and PLA can
g10 is able to ignite if heated or exposed to a flame, whereas fr4 wont
could use larger brackets that attach further from the corner i think, howre the extrusions currently attached
the picture didnt attach, mind resending it
much cheaper than a voron iirc, not sure of the set price though
In case you dont dont know PA is nylon
I suppose with a smallish syringe and a drill bit you could avoid most of the effort
inside the hotend would make a liquid filament barrier which smooths out everything
between the hotend would maybe mess with extrusion but not retractions
nah that would only mess with flex filament
yeah temp tower then
welp nvm, is the heatsink staying cold
its stupid but check the bowden tube
also is that a all metal hotend
Use that
Bore 5mm With Teeth
Cool
Those idlers arent fully useless though. You can make belted z try resell on voron
Yup, or make some really custom parts
Uh oh
What height are  the idlers
All gaps are the same height as the og models then?
And do they match the og parts in dimensions
Are those parts custom height
or wire wrap
corrugated tubing
yay
I wouldnt hold your breath, im a student so money im gonna get a job but only after the summer
I think at some point a guide will be made, or at least when I get to make mine ill record it but for now the cad and community support will be enough
no problem lmk how it all goes
i think just add that and try
[gcode_arcs]
theres some code to add, ill link it
just rotate it so the front part is different and its still easily printable
but not too old, if it were proper ancient or super low quality but tomtom seems alright
also did you try rotating and moving the object a bit and comparing gcode size to check its not cura being weird
yup, grasping at straw with that one but maybe its a old one not rated for high speeds
and what board and what cable
ill read that through in a sec, see if theres anything weird
weird, share your config
octoprint?
ive moved over to klipper but compare your results and if theres no issues mayaswell leave it always on
ah cool, my bad
no no, thats the fix, arc welder takes small segments and converts it to one g2/g3
Its barely visible, also assuming you have arcs enabled go to the plugins tab and get arc welder or manually install it
Someone more knowledgeable in marlin should step in
Think so
Gotta increase steps per mm i think
Ah, the 1.4t should be able to handle it, try 32x and interpolation (if thats in klipper)
Yep, try a higher microstepping for less noise potentially smoother prints BUT make sure your board can handle the extra work, not sure if marlin alllows you to enable interpolation/microplyer but thats 256x microsteps handled on the driver not the board
On low microstepping it might be 'musical' but at 16x or more its pretty good
Yeah its just low speed where its whiny
Then enable spreadcycle for sure, if you have it near you or at 60mm/s or so then stealthchop but seems like noise is no concern so go for spreadcycle
Not sure how but you could probably enable stealthchop during certain prints using gcode (for both fw)
Ah stick to spreadcycle for now
Whats the top speed you run
Ah my bad, mispelt. Spreadcycle is the one
Nah both have it, iirc marlin defaults to it
Stealthchop is great at low speed but swapping between the two choppers/modes will give a grinding noise and skipped steps, i can see if i can find a short clip later
Ah, i would choose spreadcycle then. If its hard for you to manually change the config and you use high speed then stick to spreadcycle
Marlin or klipper?
Usually*
Spreadcycle gets really quiet at higher speeds compared to stealthchop but at low speed stealthchop is king
Then try at spreadcycle
Stealthchop is perfect but only to a certain speed, and switching chopper isnt great. So if you run stealthchop try a set move at your standard accel and ramp up speed until its noisy or skipping
Different choppers, each have their limitation. If noise bothers you i would use stealthchop on e and z and use interpolation on all axis (assuming you need speed) otherwise stealthchop is the clear choice
Ah the cooler thing to read is the trinamic website+ docs for your chosen driver
Afaik no, i would test it out and if youve got troubles start reading docs
Assuming it is, i was told if it aint broken dont fiddle with it
Thats the sense resistor right
Of course you mean the ones on the gear shaft. Not the ones inside of the gear
Those are needle bearings right
Hm. Start manual tuning then once its close pid tune again I guess
And the thermistor is accurate?
And the hevort ones were unsuccesful or not the same size ballscrew
Hm
Is ther much temp fluctutations
It has space to escape to, less overall error in etrusiom. 5mg extra per wall results in 15mg in 3 perim but in more its 15+ and maybe theres just enough gap for 15mg to go but anymore sticks to the nozzle and ruins it
Try flow first, it may bhe that
Try flow 2-4% lower or check your lin advance
Lets see
Thank you, im good most of the time its just the exams man, they get to you. But ya know it is what it is
Its just very stressful
Oh for sure. I just have to worry about social, school and my 3d printer not catching fire
But I'm not salty
And it wad a month earlier becausw we had a 'drop down week' full of 'fun activities'
Lol my end of years was 3 a day for a week
Im noy great at the belt path stuff
Ah crap. My bad
Yeah, visual difference is hbot has 2 belt ends to secure and is very long, corexy is shorter belts and 4 ends
And voron. Like maze said is corexy
Hbot is a very different belt path with many issues unless you have a near perfect frame
Hbot ks a belt path and voron uses corexy
Dude if you disabled retraction you could (prbobably) beat his record
Disable retraction
You ddint
Wait
But community opinion so far is dd is goodest
Nothing wrong with trying and inovating
Nitrams bowden is reinforced and is almost directly straight down and is barely long enough to work and the fittings allow no wobble or movement
With a short straight rigid bowden*
Yes
In certain cases
And only on weaker steppers
To a certain threshold sure
Depends
Im gonna be trying to find a barbed fitting like nitrams
Im just testing whatever i have on hand
But the higher you mount the extruder, to an extent, the shorter the tube
Im gonna try a bowden like his soon so i can tell ya how it goes
Its a PET wire mesh and heatshrink tubing possibly with metal mesh and more heatshrin
Infinite, you just need more torque and better tolerances and more speed
What bed and printer is that?
no problem
ah well, you can talk directly to vez if you @ him in <#832673308645654588> . you can also validate and iterate your design using simscale.com using the guide from TeachingTech
what would you like to discuss, if its design youll need to aqsk Vez, if you wanna talk about why its needed then a few of our users will be able to asnwer that
Wait lemme get a guide
same
neither is better than the other the real difference is the ui
also i beleive its either klipperscreen (mounted on the printer and is a touchscreen) or fluid or mainsail. to test fluid and mainsail i reccomend kiauh or just installing both and trying them out
which simon
No clue how to, I tried mine and coukdnt get supports off. The petsfang is much nicer or even bullseye imo
Then I would go for the high torque or 2 motors. I dont think you need a whopper but if the price increase isn't massive I would go for it. But this is really a game of balancing torque and speed
Well what speed do you print usually
Yup those or the wantai or the ldo reccomended for voron or e3d whopper/ high torque is a good choice. Wichever is best for your use case is good
Pure tragedy
What a shame
Oopsie. Your hand is forced
Buy a nice fancy motor
I guess you'll just have to
Not a broken motor
Uh oh
Yes. If the board isnt easily accessible then this seems good enough
If it's the motor you probably just have to get another
If it persists its your socket or fw
If its drivers I would say check for physical damage then swapsies and test
Swappable drivers
Good
What board is this
If it is its probably fixable with some questionable soldering or fw
If it persists its the driver if not itd the stepper
Pog? Now to find a spare or easily accesible motor and test it
Same here. Talk later
Have yoy unmounted thw stepper and tried that same gcode
Alright nothing jumps out as wrong
Try removing it. Also try send a vid from a perpendicular view of the printwr when its making that noise
wait send a photo of the printers y axs from the front and from the side, also try the paper thing, you can see vibrations very easily
and try running it forward and back with a peice of paper taped on the left/right of the bed and front/back and watch how much it shakes
alright, and the leveling knobs are fairly tight
and vslot wheels are tight
mine shakes and makes a rattleing noise
and check it isnt the leadscrew wobbling
re tighten the z axis extrusions
<@!202189639593754624>
wait
try the stepper mount for vibrations
but for best results buy 2 sets and send the second to me
i hear hiwin are the only way
wantai are pretty good, do you have any spare steppers or a second printer
my stock creality steppers are fairly good
but i very much doubt its the stepper
it could be a funky mishap in the stepper driver or wiring, or it could be a flimsy frame with a wide range of resonant frequencys
nope sorry your right its not belts and bearings, my next guess would be flimsy mounts or driver
this will tell you wether its the driver and motor or belts and bearings
try remove the motor and move the y
also keep in mind the noise might not happen at all speeds, szo start slow and slowly ramp up
but if you unplug it make sure the printer is off
and mine are fine
well i backdrive motors all the time
consider having all the rails upside down and mounting the x rail directly on top of the y, you gain rigidity and possibly reduce chances of racking, but theres nothing wrong with the design as far as i can see
although the y gantry doesnt weigh much so its well within their weightend load, you would just perform better if they were upside down or right side up
Good. Cylindrical tubes would habe been more expensive and had more flaws
Cylinder or cuboid
but check out his vid, its much better explained
then check your blocks and gantry were screwed on correctly
and check out gantry racking, neo3dp (think thats his name) has a vid on it
is belt tension equal
but strongly advsed against
theoretically its doomed to fail but its user experience in this case
some for hours before they ripped
some have had them for years
although some people have used them just fine its best not to take that chance and destroy a printer
but dont use a small pulley for those
Check out simscale and teaching techs guide
ah then thats probably the best bet
check ebay
expensive but the tool looks fine
<@202189639593754624> check out trianglelabs hardened nozzles, I couldn't cut it with a saw so its sturdy
nice
it also means you can re sell this driver later on
well its reversible and allows for you to just plug the pin into a endstop pin eventually
id reccomend heating the solder and yoinking them up
i think it is, its near the bottom of the configs ifaik
perhaps they need hardware pwm, do they run off a 9v battery?
then perhaps firmware or try with only 1 fan
manual boost
give them a flick
but they might not be set as always opn fans
and give them a boost
try spin them by hand
is tinning better than bare wires, and how about 2 fans in parralel
heres a cheap set and be very careful with shorting anything 
no pro but ive been told not to do that, i think someone more qualified shouold answer that
trust me do it now, make sets and make sure they arent intertwide, it will make re wiring if needed much easier
also it looks like you have 2 wires coming out of 1 terminal, whats with that
also bundle up sets of wires and zip tie them and untangle them
looking good, if no leds go on immediately power down and unplug your endstops and try again
or use fiingers
i used flush cutters as tweezers but tweesers are best
it should stay on for a sec then fully off and the buttons will drain any leftover power
for safety just turn it off with the psu then unplug then press some buttons
nice, glad too help, i have mine running at 90% of maximum at 40c so if you need more power just slowly increase until you have just enough power
nah, just got it the wrong way round and theres no directions on how to install it, so pop goes the board
yep
i plugged mine in and the board caught fire and stopped working
just avoid the tft cable and use the exp1 and 2 cables
ah, well im better at the physical part
and make sure the jumper for the power isnt on usb power
and send a photo of the board, top down preferably
do you have a tft cable plugged in
yes
and stay 15 degrees below max
get the temp way down, the actual package can be anywhere from 60 to 80 degrees
jinkys, get a fan and get cooling
yeah max rms is 2.1A i think
and too much for the driver too
Quick explanation of current setting on TMC drivers. the value you put in should be the RMS value. not peak value that is written on the stepper.
The calculation of RMS from peak current is this:
Motor_Peak_Current x 0.707

Since we don't want to push the motors with 100% we'll do:
Motor_Peak_Current x 0.707 x 0.80

That will give us a 20% safety margin.
On a stock Ender 3 motor that is 0.84A peak 
0.84x0.707x0.8 = 0.47A

So you input 0.47 in run_current of your TMC stepper. 

A normal 1.4A stepper is:
1.4x0.707x0.8 = 0.79A

so you put 0.79 in run_current of your tmc stepper. 

the Hold current there is no "rule" about. i like to do Run_Current - 0.2
This will depend on the use case.
i think maze may be right, you did what i did and didnt find the rms value
yikes
yep
try running some stress tests
thats normal
then max and min temp
then sensor type
[temp_sensor peepeepoopoo]
just remember the heatsink temp isnt representative of the driver temp, it will be anywhere from 5 to 10 degrees cooler
make sure it is actually a temp problem
wack a desk fan in front of it and run the same gcode
alright so thats normal looking, hows the heatsink installed
Could be but I think its more likely your x motor is just moving more, but recheck the config for a spelling error
Try taping a thernistor to the heatsink wnd aim for sub 40 temps. Add a fan it you need to
Fill thin walls or something like that maybe
i got smooth ones so i couldnt care less
i got mine at 20 pence each
they clip through a tonne which sucks cause i dont want nudity, just cool clothes
im having issues with some clothing mods and custom bodys
hello
The mod was privated
Yeah I couldn't find it, tried way back machine and searching for a reupload
hey any update on that
It's such a shame they privated the mod
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
"clean my settlement" btw
if anyone has it downloaded or knows where i can get it id greatly appreciate it
it pales in comparison to some of yall but 10hrs is almost the 2nd most ive played any game
nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/45544?tab=files
im tryna download this, i cant use the redux as im already quite invested in this playthrough
No worries, whenever you get a chance, there's no rush
Afaik my options are to run my own DIY cable with no shielding, buy a new cable and wait for it to arrive, somehow fix this one?
I've narrowed the issues down to the cable this time, it's the ground it just isn't connected across the cable
My cartographer crapped out again
Hey maze could I get some advice
ah thats cool, i was thinking any league playing at 300fps has gotta be hardcore asf üòÖ . ive tried shooting once and its really tough
huh, okay, do you know where to install it. i did some googling and can only see a single doc mentioning it via kiuah but dont see it via kiuah anywhere
hey maze have you seen this error before "Section 'gcode_shell_command delete_old_raw_data' is not a valid config section"
ooh very nice, one of my classmates got one so ive had a few bits and bobs from their printer. its all very nice quality
now to figure out why it wont print nicely at speed üò¢ 
sorry for all this bother
shouldve listened to you when you reccomended it a week ago üòÖ
i ended up following raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#raspberry-pi-2b-3a-3b-cm3-cm3-zero-2-w
since i have a 3b not a 3b+. but its working much better
I should be able to just clone the micro SD to a USB and it will work
Eh I spoke too soon, I'm working on getting it to boot from USB now
hm no web interface works but it cant connect to the mcu. sorry to keep messaging with all this, but if you dont mind, what should i be looking for in the log files?
not the web interface tho, üôÑ , im going to reinstall mainsail and moonraker viah kiuah
no clue why it wasnt working. its decided to work on the same IP now
That makes more sense
Ah true so it might not be the right IP and the web interface would show anyways?
I'll double check with angry IP scanner after dinner
That's what I thought but it still shows the initial web interface but loads indefinitely
I tried to since I figured reinstalling moonraker would help but it times out üòÄ
if you get a chance, let me know if you have any ideas why it wont connect
and i cant get good quality out of it over 150mm/s
it worked last night, but now i cant connect via a computer. if the web interace loads it says moonraker issue or it just loadds indefinitely
but ive got 2 new issues
hey maze. did that acetone soak and tighten, it doesnt seem to be leaking anymore which is good
I'll try tomorrow
I can't get it to connect to a phone or computer üò§
So disassemble?
I'm worried about the acetone fumes messing with the printed tool head parts
Hey man, just getting around to trying that acetone soak on the hotend, any way to do it without disassembly
Cool cool
I'm leaning towards 0.6, since i don't mind thicker layers thh and a large layer height is faster
Jofs got some spares, but only 0.4 or 0.6. which would you go for
thats crazy
oh wow really
Oh definitely not, last time it was a single shot pistol for "hunting"
Yup üòÇ, although I'm 99% sure one of them is asking for knuckle dusters
And I've got at least 5 people messaging me to get parts printed for them
The printer looks great, my whole family have oohed and aaahed
Good good üòÇ
At first I thought you were just saying it was nice to meet her üòÇ
Hahahaha that's alright
also need a bit of design advice üòÖ
hey maze, im working on some CAD for a project, any chance i could get you to look over them and give me a bit of feedback
pshhh posh grandparents
ive eaten steaks more expensive!
i think so, shipping is only ¬£37!!
and now im having jay build my printer üòÖ
it was great all around
absolutely, im so glad i went. apart from going to smrrf, i loved meeting everyone and staying at the house
i wonder who the newer faster machines belong too hehe
ah thats rough, good for us though üòÖ
everyone was so friendly and respectful and our booth really was a hit üòÑ
i had a great time, i really cant wait for the next time. thank you for the memories ü´∂
Awesome that's perfect for me
6 more left to charge üòé
Gotta get my flashlights ready
In a lighter tone, I've got 7 batteries charging rn üòé
Oh man that sucks, get well soon man
but thats fair
if you dont mind me asking, rehab from what?
plus see some youtubers
im looking forwardm to smrff, itll be nice to catch up with everyone and properly meet the team
haha thanks
awesome, the gf is much happier üòÖ
Might knock it into alignment
It doesn't deserve a roof spot, well strap it to the bumper
I can bring my abomination that is no way affiliated to ZeroG kinda
Oh gotcha üòÇ
eyyy who else is going from zero g
Alright yeah, we should be able meet you there at 1 ish
ill talk to my parents tonight and let you know
ill leave straight from school hopefully
should be
It's a solid stop
Yeah there's plenty places to eat
Cool, we can decide to pick up on the day or not
Yeah, home might work, but I don't know if my mum's comfortable with that. You guys might have to wait a couple minutes there since I finish school at 12 50 I think
Since my mum wanted to meet everyone, I figure we'll meet you inside and have a cursory hello and then I'll leave with you
its not much but ive got a bit spare üí∞  and i want to say thanks for all you've done for me
hey do you have a "buy me a coffee" page
cool
are you in germany?
I'll get it all, if there's any unforseable costs I'll cover them
Hi maze, could I get a package sent to your house that you forward to me, I'll buy the shipping label and send it over, you'd just have to hold the package. Its a flashlight, but the seller only ships to the European union. Im not 100% sure if I want to buy it so it's just a maybe
its only a hand pull so consistency is üëé  but im gonna try a longer pull using the auto spooler next
I MADE FILAMENT
hey, guess what
Now for the exhilarating part, firmware üòî
So now it's firmware time
I can cut the bottles
I was too lazy to fix those bearings, but a different design came out yesterday that uses some bearings I have so I tried it and it worked
Hey guess what
When I've got the Dremel and bearing I'll send you a photo of how I'm cutting, it's hard to angle any way to avoid metal in the bearing
They go everywhere. I'm using a carbide cutter thing and it has a knack for throwing metal into my hands and onto the bearings
Yeh, once they're done you'll see
The cut goes a little deeper than the sheild so it ends up getting in the way
Although redesigning all those bits will probably have a knock on eefect on every other part
That's not too bad, also forgot to mention, if I can't fix the bearings then I've got a backup plan. I bought 15 bearings from a friend for 1.50 that will work in a cutter so I've got a total of 8 attempts until I'm out of bearings to mutilate
What needed changing
LoL, how's the printer going
Probably should have used tensioned steel wire for rigidity
Yeah, did you see his printers a little under designed imo
Well that maze guy seems pretty good, but of a newb but he's got a good attitude
And fixing it is no fun
But now I'm future me
I saw it coming and just figured it's a problem for future me
Yup
And the cut requires the sheilds removed
The little metal bits fell into the bearing and clogged it, and the size is 6023zz but with the sheilds removed (cheaper to buy with than without)
The bearings are C R U N C H Y so I've got to repack them or try to clean them
Kinda, it's a 30 degree cut on the outer edge
Hit some fairly major road blocks, but everything is in place and I've just got to get round to grinding some bearings
agh, good luck
hows life going for you?
looks like dc motors from what i can see a lot of gear boxes, ive mostly split it into chunks but not opened fully yet, im sure ill need a little help once its open identifying everything
unfortunately it had 1 single stepper in the entire machine, still cool though
mostly, cant use the shed for a couple weeks so ive had to pause
true, true but shiny metal ü•∫
im thinking of live streaming it all and make the first fully documented build on yt but im lazy so i dunno
ill re use a few bits but a lot will be new
i dont have one yet, so this will be all scratch
yeah im gonna settle for keeping motion as is after building but the z, electronics and most everthing else i enjoy changing
this build is gonna be less of a death trap, gonna have a nice panel for all the io cables with quick connect. planning on keeping the build simple but expandable when i get more moneys
yup, if not ill buy it anyways
although the chances of getting it early/free are low
i might see if i can get those sheet metal x bits from vez and preorder or beta test for mellow the non meoving metal
not that i could afford the fancy hot filaments but i like the alu look
thinking about building a mostly metal vzbot
pretty good, got some exams coming up
and the serials i gotta zip again
plate bottom is the mount
Steppers only since theyre in the chamber , potentially drivers but only with long heatpipes soldered to the heatsinks
I have spare tubing and a water pump lying around (dunno what voltage the pump is tho so that'll be fun) im gonna test it by running a pancake stepper at 1.2rms and use a melzi board to monitor temp and control the pump
I just finiahed flattening some copper plates that im gonna stick a heatsink too and use to run water over
Remeber last time, its like that but worse cause all my sticky tape fell off and im part way through testing water cooling
Cnc'ed parts are gonna take a while, i would make it from u profile, also you get to have the unique machine. Every prosumer of vzbot will have cnc but not u profile gantry
Idk, my cable management is already gOd TiEr
The joy of not upgrading now because youll upgrade later but not upgrading later cause you'll just make it obsolete again
Ahh
If you have cardboard big enough cut it and try fit it and adjust from there then using it as a cutting guide
Unlike certain designs *ender 3 belt tensioners* its fairly unnoticeable
Nice, clean print and its not very bulky
The orage parts?
It works
Thank you for all the help, good luck
Yup
Cool, usual delet then reinstall with kiuah

looks good to me
Whats the file for that again
Sorry for late reply (went to watch football) Ah. Tried that but got an error (ill send a screencwp in a sec) and port 82 wont connect (that's dwc2)
Forgot to ask you, how do acces dwc2 and fluidd (already installed them)
Might wanna clear that up in the vzbot server tho
No problem
Or just block
Ah its fine, just tell him im fired and block him
Literally yesterday
Over vc, ive messaged him at least once a day if you wanna see that
He was spamming me for admin, and was spamming nsfw stuff in some other 3d printer discords a while back
Hes athiest
Oh ffs, its a friend
Sorry, misclicked, was trying to view your roles
iNtErEsTiNg
Well
Well
Well
Just thought i'd let you know, but also i wont tell anyone if anything ÔΩâÔΩéÔΩîÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩÖÔΩìÔΩîÔΩâÔΩéÔΩá pops up
I wanted googl translate built in and reverse image searching and new themes so i got plugins and i misclicked and got one that lets me see hidden channels
Nope, plugins for dicord, side effcect is that i can see hidden channels, i also have  é ûun…ü text
I can see all the hidden channels
T·¥á·¥á ú·¥á·¥á
hey wanna see something cool
Looks pretty clean
Looks too safe, im sure a paperclip would do the same job just as well /s
thanks
Well I saw a good point that not everything will pull the same amount of power so different ports with different power fuses would be useful for some cases
Damn that looks safe and very clean, are the outputs fused
If the stuff I found is actually going to a bin then ill get free insulation and 10 small windows and some ikea boxes if theyre big enough and if i need it a radiator
Guess who just hit the motherload
thanks for the tip, im also looking into selling on etsy and slowly climbing to reselling on amazon
lucky bugger
no problem
tone doesnt translate well over text
my bad i thought the cut the cynisicm thing was a 'im in on the joke too' kinda thing
could you send me yours so i can port it over to mine
turns out i had my config very wrong for temp controlled fans
you could always add one later
damn thats looking fine
guess i know what my 3rd printer is
ooooooooh
dang that sucks
no
no
oh no

i dont think you reslly need the heater, lemme check my config
damn, thats a lot of thermistors. mine doesnt have the heater but still turns on and off at the right temp- i think
so not enough
im not seeing any ryzen 5 5600xs'
nice, planning on any cooling based off of temps
The drastic dip on the driver temp is when I introduced a fan to test the heatsink effectivety. Everything is working and all I need to do is fix my wiring, thanks for the help
yeah, much better than marlin, it actually tells you whats wrong with the config
also the board works and i have a ton of fan and thermistor ports to use for cooling
thank you so much
heck yah
Hmm, ill try again
I cant get one that opens out to the fan and doesnt pull air from around the tube instead of inside
Would someone mind cadding up a duct for me, to go from a tube(12.05mm) To a 4010 axial fan that has the fan pulling air from the tube, or using a blower fan have the air pulled though but waft out a tube (use the fan like a vacuum pump but not push air through it)
If not is that for all steppers it drives or per stepper
Damn. Sure beats 256, or is it just measured differently
Possibly loud ones but I'm not sure
External beefier higher voltage drivers
Nvm
No
Wait
Gravity does it for you
In what direction on which part
but none of the 5 linear movement actuators needed can be the same
then for a 1mm step the bed does 0.5mm and the frame does 0.5mm
i mean a standard e5 but the bed is fixed at the z=0 postion then you life the entire frame independent of the bed (wich also moves up and down)
lemme draw it
nah nah
i need to see a printer that does that
wait
consider having the bed fized down and raise the entire frame with linear actuators
i hear my calling
No problem
Lol
How much?
Fix
I see. So you do just have to beef it up theres no clever fox
Then why not a open channel for the dowels
So. If I understand correctly, the balls and the dowels are pulled down by the magnet
Oh you mean in the z. Slap some glue on it and call it a day or redesign and print it
Ahh, theres not much plastic next to it
Which walls. That looks fairly solid to me
Ballscrew??
Thumbscrew maybe
Gooderest
Gooderer
Much gooder
Oops sorry. Solidworks. There's a separate program you can use but I have no expireince with it

Yup
Totaly
Suuure
Oh yeah
Rich coming from you
Shut it
Gormet shiz
I'm having this and ice cream
Lmao. Hoem alone means I choose my own lunch
worst ive had is grommets in my ears
yeesh, for heavy items you constantly use or left you could add a counterweight with some pulleys
pjs are for after school and weekends
no no no, if im out with friends its after school so ill be in a blazer and trousers
i usually wear pajamas and a plain t shirt, but only because i outgrew my trousers and i cant find good ones
nope
i mostly play beatsaber (singleplayer or custom lobbies with friends) or pavlov (easy to meet online friends but hard to keep them)
i havent signed in to my xbox for months
same, the only gaming i do nowadays is vr
ah then that game is completely  out your alley
and you can simulate inflation in game
ever tried slime rancher, theres no time cap to anything, no need to play regularly and its sound design is mwah, also very relaxing game
and gaming consoles are great but not for my use case, also my pc freezes when launching discord and runs cs go at 80fps on 480p
stadia flopped, big time, bigger than my hopes to make a speed benchy
bleugh, stadia
r5 outperformed the r7 in quite a few games on zen3 so it may not be a bad choice going forward
ah, so i just gotta buy some stuff and make a fancy page and make some money, ill see if i can get that setup and start with 3d prints then move on to re selling
oh yeah. im getting a ryzen 7 5th gen and a 4060 if its out or a 3070
as in bulk buy and resell on my own webstore?
but im waiting til 2022-2023 for pc parts to be available
my parents said theyll pay for my pc but its gota last me through college or else im funding it, thabk god
lucky, my neighbourhood is all built up so no grass to mow and i havent checked supermarkets (i will look into that) but yeah my area is fairly dead
technically yes but my school is a whiles away so no can do, i gotta be on the bus at 7
age, stupid child protection laws stopping me from being exploited, ugh
that and a job, but im not allowed
thanks, i really got to get more tools
make a 'sidecar' for the chair for the cat, or put a pillow on the seat whenever you arent sat down
F
i got things to do
its 8:45]
it was 50p for 50 screws and free shipping
mine are all cheap screws from ali
Unfortunately London isn't great for yard sales but I can keep a eye out
Cheers. Print failed and I went to bed so I can reslice with smaller holes
m5 screw also 5.1mm
cool
so fairly tight but nothing plasric cracking
its holding leaner rails on my y axis
to thread into?
what size hole should i use for m3 screws
couldnt get the screw head to show up clearly
<@!141593844788494336>  send help. i legitametly dont know who or how it got there, the ends have brackets covering them and are glued in place, so how did it get there
I dont think I can do that shape on tinkercad
Mine was a straight hole
Oh
Dang I gotta check shops more
My linear rails cost that much
Costly
Where
Lucky bugger
But I think threading plastic will be good enough for now
Hahahahahah. Vice. Imagine. I cant afford one of those
And the ends are capped
It got in and wont get out
one of mine is 1.5mm off center
the holes need to be im=n the right spot
hole location
i could use plastic threads
no can do, too much money
not accurate enough and i suck at using them
just wait
bruh its not
alright, lemme send you a photo of the problem, also how do i make recessed nuts
so reccesed nuts
no wood
Either precisely placed heated inserts (no bueno) or nuts (dunno how to do)
I need a way to attach a linear rail to a print
Its cause he cant handle THE HEAT
<@141593844788494336>. Ya know burns dont work if you dont check ya messages
That's why when I get mod imma ban you from this channel
Yeah
Lol
suuuure
mhm, ok
From HEVORT in case anyone missed it
Gonna catch flak for pinging everyone - but kinda a big one as we venture into AWD (4 motor corexy) territory. The latest klipper packages include what is needed now to add your x1 and y1 motors without issue (like you do with z1 and z2 for Z), BUT, you will need to configure your endstop in for those motors as well. Just a heads up. (Mine is sensorless homing, so copy whatever you are using for x and y over to x1 and y1)
If you're using FLY/Mellow 5160 HV drivers: STOP! 

There are stepper drivers (as far as I know) where a specific condensator  blows up

Mellow has also made a comment on this issue:

------------Mercury One.1 Beta------------
The Mercury One project is currently transitioning to onshape.
Due to this, we are able to release a view only version of the cad while Mercury One.1 is in beta.
This will not allow downloads due to our release standards.
Feel free to have a look and play around with it.

Please note that the BOM in onshape is incomplete and may contain errors so it is not recommended to use this.

how'd you find it
Or is it just overall better wheras a 3d printer both are comparable
Is that because varibale forces arent good on steppers and the servo runs best with lots of time to react
Yup
Could you pinch the belt onto the pulley with some bearings
Saw that too, i assume its either fake or a bulk buy or ones that didnt pass qc for some bigger company
Ah cool, different beast than steppers then?
I agree that if it can rotate faster then it gets 'shifted' but i dont see how a higher voltasge would make it spin faster
And usually you want a 8:1 ratio of aupply voltage to coil voltage
You may know better, but i though it wasnt higher speed but rather higher aceleration cause less back emf so higher effective power in the coil
General advantage that you can only gain by losing or harming something that is considered less important. Testing at the expense of my wallet
'for the greater good'
Although they may have the same benefits anyway if its rated for it
I would think its not a 1:1 need for hv. Steppers on their own need it for good acel but maybe these dont, idk
These are 24v only too so no dangerous high voltage
Cheap, amazon and good
If these wrk well put it in announcements
These are the 200k acell right
And higher resolution
Smaller pulley = more torque output. Lower rpm tho
Other way round isnt it
Everyones wanted to go fast for a while, its just all of a sudden the technology available has sky rocketed and everyones starting to realise how ez it is
Awful or *awsome*
Motor be like^
Hehehe the wirring noise and shaking
Perhaps if you get the smaller ones you could try drill out the rotor or replace it with a c.f. pipe (assuming rotor inertia is a problem)
I would get the right size then try weird mods after, and if they send you the correct motord and let you keep this one then go crazy and try changing it for a cf shaft, but exercise caution, and no safety squints
Have you looked at the trinamic bldcs and steppers, also they list 60v version sof the 5160 in integrated circuits
So smol
Ah, well i suppose higher power is nice but you shouldnt have been sent the completely wrong motor
I assume you ordered the 6//8mm version with 400W, thats kinda crappy
Uh oh, printed adapter while you wait for parts or drill out what you have, or lathe time
Every other speedboater rn <:mildpanic:749949034088759386>
Pog
Or have the tube enter the enclosure from a higher point and have a fairly straight path for the tube
It reduces lifespan and effectivity while making noise
The bearings rattle, same as how maglev iirc work terribly when flat
What happened with that custom block
Psh just run 1x microstep durrr
Hhahahahahahaha, 20A
Beauty eh
I think robotdigg is good, usongshine too and a few others
Ah cool
Yeh
I wonder if a higher stiffness would remove the oscillations
I suppose during active printing it wouldnt matter on a Cartesian but if you use a corexy a lack of stiffness would ruin the mechanics
It will skip much more easily, also will that servo need a reduction, it should have minimal cogging right#
Why jot use twisted cables
Wdym, you could crimp your own if needed
Sure, it would be a great resource and as long as it doesnt impede you i wouldnt mind watching
Holy moly. So these re much more powerful
Whats the average stepper wattage (generic high torque ones)
Could always zip tie it but yeah its a lot of effort, and it may really just be a higher quality better board fixed it
If it's a daisy chain of grounds why not undo the first one and unground it for one test print
Could a system like automatic transmisions for for your printer and allow foir super high speeds and low speeds or does the way it work not compatible with 3d printers
<@!509772297289072653>  ^
That looks like 36 or more
Can it be second hand?
Betcha I could go lower
Ah, my bad
39 bucks
I think a gearbox with auto transmission would be awesome. Slow prints can utilise a 4 or more to 1 ratio (it would be hard to implement but worth it) and fast prints can use 1 to 1
For quality yes. Without it cogging is really bad iirc
1:2 gear tho
eek
ah so this is a massive downgrade
whats the current max rate
poggers, im gonna watch the shit out of that, even though i cant afford a single odrive/servo
if you mean one motor yanking the other one out of position, thats what holding torque is for (odrive implements this by backdriving a motor afaik since dc motors dont tend to have a holding torque)
if i understand what you mean, then no this is how corexy works, one belt can move the carriage at a perfect 45 degree angle and 2 in conjuction can move on the x and different combinations will move differnt ways
i was worried you meant like pvc insulation for a second
ah thats a question for vez
do you mean with the large tubes at the edge (i believe theyre called ferules), cause every sane person would make sure their wires arent just bare silicon/copper
oh you mean is it 'intelligent' in the sense it knows what its doing, i dont think so since it just recives a signal and executes it on motor one or 2
corexy is doable with odrive and is fully functional, when you say independently do you meam can it decode co ordinates and convert that into 2 motors on corexy
do you mean a move on x and y on a corexy or a 4 motor setup
i see
right so its rated up to 50A but doesnt always pull 50A
unless you mean rated up to
well wheres the other 80A#
where do the power come from?
daaang
sick, i gotta get another psu and a step down for my bed and motor power
vez's new motors leaked?
did you just use the autotune of the servos and not manually tune them
tbf servos have less positional accuracy so that may have an impact, i wonder if theres a way to smooth out the input
<@!451709396280410132>
You just solder in new capacitors rated for 60v and you're off to the races
It can
yeah, whichevers best would get a lot more revenue from every high speed printer builder
i wonder if trinamic would give them to vez
i wonder if its worth it
dayum .6 is tiny
on skr pro you just need new capacitors
you could get a 60v psu and use a step down converter
skr pro is 26 bucks
just use thermal pads
well it would be nice to run a print that slowly gets faster and faster and be able to see how much it skipped steps
Nice
Damn. Best I can get is 125k on steppers on long straight moves on one motor. Imagine what 2 clearpaths could do
<@!509772297289072653>  for squezing some performance out of steppers check out this thread and tuning driver pwm
holy moly
no moves it just spits out as much as it can all at oncce
it just spits out a ton of plastic at one location, its meant for tpu but works well to save time
why not spagheti infill on cura
please upgrade and record the difference
damn
yeah definetly cooling or a lack there of
could be a shaky nozzle or a bad cooler
cooling or get a better mount
trianglelabs v6 has given me nothing but beatiful and easy prints, my retracts are 1.5mm on a e5 stock bowden
i saw a bigbox on ebay for 35, they had a skrv1.4 and tmc2209s with it for free a a few clone hotends, but it was too far away for me to pick up
if you get it off aliexpress like me (i got mine at ¬£3 total) then its roughly 48x less
Because of levers? A longer heatbreak and pins would help, but centering the heaviest part on the linear rail would also help
i suppose anything for a large scale printer will be good at high speed
but will aliexpress clone it for me
holy moma
i need
but thats a straight move on one motor
psh i get can get a max of 125k at 350mm/s
i dont understand gears all to much or gearing, but yes i think so
but you could always try a 36t to 20t to 40t
20 to 40 would be a 1:2 ratio
that would work, and can easily be hotswapped for different gearings on the fly
yep
<@662317232491331591> it's too late now but ABS+ (at least esun) softens and partially dissolves so it might've done it
Kinda yeh
nf crazy is great, you can always extend it with a copper nut and use a cht nozzle/ cht extender. the volcomosq and subsequent knockoffs are also pretty good
You might want to add some air pockets against the edge of the block for insulation
sine the heater groove and hozzle thread
the walls are 0.5mm there
theres likely cracks in the walls

<@210804576897597442> would a slot cut into the heater core that allows for a copper plate to be inserted infringe on the patent. If it's marketed as a different feature or something but coincidentally be used as a flow splitter does that infringe
as long as theres 0.5mm left on the z you can print one layer at a time and glue it together
It can be dissolved in water
<@775555384093311006>  the safest bet is boron nitride which is a mold release iirc and sets solid
Yup
like boron nitride
u tried some thermal paste
oh wait no that was a stupid question.nvm
absolutely any chance you set a max extruder speed somewhere
is the diffference within margin of error
Yeah that'll probably do it
How do you sign up that?
with m+ and cht and lgx lite thats beleivable
nop
its still going
and while the ball is rolling slowly
which is why id like to make it
its gonna leak, still fun to try, itll just probably leak
No need for screws
Thank you for the ted talk
No Visual degredation/=no off gassing
Especially since it's heavier than air if you have small animals on the ground they'll notice is sooner than you
At all
Not worth risking it
'not a problem' birds drop dead near Dupont plants
its all ptfe
not really
mmmm
for safety get a all metal
the fumes from ptfe are a nuerotoxin
stay under 230 as rule of thumb
Unfortunately most people only have their OG printers board as a spare so you'll probably be limited to 2 thermistors but they'll suffice
A thermistor on the heartbreak, hotblock and water block should let you know if it's working well
But it should be fine, so if you've got the equipment and are bothered you may as well mount it off printer with a spare board and see if it works
The biggest concern would be what the water route is internally
I think theres a e3d hotend that's similar, either way the base hotend bits should be really good since trianglelabs has some really nice e3d clones (have one of their v6s that hasn't clogged yet)
iirc vez got one
which i think is gross but whatever
unfortanutely my DT department told me to get lost when i asked to borrow their drill press
already got 3 on there, and after the initial drilling ill have a good guide
I'll be using a center drill first which should stop the deflection
First plan is talking to my dt department
I've got the right size star shape bit but now I need to buy the drill bit and find a m6 nut as the one I thouh i had isn't actually m6
The premelty bit will have a star shape pressed into it for more melt
I'm trying on a volcano nozzle so the filament can get a little soft before being shoved through a metal grate
Yup, got one in my blazer for tomorrow
Cool alright, so I should get the kit of multiple bits and a .7mm center drill
I can always put more solder around the wire to fill the hole
Hey <@265629116106145793>  what's a good minimum size for drilling with a drill press
Indeed, I just gotta figure out making it
ive got dinner but ill be back with more
thank you for the tip, i was also planning on using a center drill to start it and possibly trying to press a torx bit into the back of the hotend for a star shape for more surface area
what if i pre drill a slightly lareger hole in a m6 bolt to get less movement
hand drill?
amazon.co.uk/QLOUNI-0-4mm-3-2mm-Drilling-Helicoidal-Precision/dp/B07D9J3XSR . Havent yet decided which
whats a better alternative?
im getting a pack of ten for a reason
but with a volcano nozzle
then ill build my oen
im tryimg to get access to a drill press and half mm drill bit
can always cancl
Also starting to agree with you. Perhaps a shade darker would look even better
Dang that looks good
the kind that cost 600+ for 1kg
pek and peek i would assume, and ultem and pei. those kind of materials
is it something akin to those?
unicorn horn essence
ah well, trade secret i suppose
i would ask nitram for his secret sauce on his silicone sock
go figure, the 'perfect' machine isnt so
and the first person to report it was sponsored by them
same with the e3d v7
yeah, once someone has it in hand we can judge a little better
volcano with funky shape and a few support tubes
*Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) heaters are self-regulating heaters that run open-loop without any external diagnostic controls
also, i cant find the image again but they said something about a ptc heater ( i think) that reduces energy output the higher the temp. so being able to swap cold and having a hardware thermal runaway control will make this quite enticing for primary schools/public printers
but i dont think this is targeted towards the majority of this server. a large fam that needs to swap a lot of nozzles quickly and safely would benfit
ill wait for a full test before imparting much judgement
it does talk about being super light, and that round heater and long meltzone is quite nice
at the end of the day, i couldnt do better and a step forward for ease of use is nice for an average user or a school
the nozzle is the heatbreak is it not
looks liek you can leave the heater in
i hope its super duper light or something magic
ah darn this is all at tct3sixty. i shouldve gone this year but managed to talk myself out of it
didnt even know they had one coming anyways
wtf, its still a structural heatbreak
Hello
Perhaps
huh
marlin does it
you need high conductivity with ease of machining and a high specififc thermal mass (iirc thats how you say)
yeah otherwise you do a quick extrude asnd temps plummet
and ocasionally nickel plated copper or brass
i would just avoid abrasives alll toggether
ah cool
will thast heat break be a structural part
oh hey congrats on becoming a admin ( i think, i dont recall your name being red a few days ago)
also which hotend are you modifying/ what did you design
theres drawbakcs to all those (like melty plastic) but wouldnt t be cheaper
could you prototype with cheap wood or remelted and cast plastic, just to get tolerance and fitment right
makes sense if you dont wanna get ripped off by other companies
overpriced and extortionist prices yada yada
psh i knew that, obviously
Big Horse Power, maybe ?
I wonder if doing that on a stepper would gain you some speed or accel but it wouldnt be worth using until we get down to half second advancements
oops, didnt see that, thanks <@!202189639593754624>  for that warning, guess boron nitride might be the best option
so copper has a higher thermal conductivity than kryonought and boron nitride is also higher, so you really want a thin a layer to fill and dents or micro gaps and keep the thermistor i n place
cool, you may need to try re applying a few times since that stuff dries fairly quickly and benefits from a thin layer
ah cool, thats good, im looking at getting it since my blocks tolerances are probably +-5cm but it was cheap, the paste seems pretty thick so be careful in application and its not electrically conductive so dont worry about it shorting stuff
no problem, i would rather not have your household get gassed mid print because i made a bad reccomendation, now i would still be cautious using the thermal grizzly directly on the heater but ill read a bit more and @you if it looks unsafe
gelid seems to be anywhere from 110-213c nothing in these ranges are gonna be usable on a printer so avoid the gelid like the plague
looks like thermal grizzy does up to 350, keep within that range and avoid toxic fumes, otherwise go for it anywhere you like (not inside the nozzle though)
what temp is it rated up to
Modify a bmg or modify the shaft
Nice
Just use a chopped up nozzle as a spacer and a nut to cover any exposed nozzle
pogchamp- now no offense to vlad but i really want a tl nova mashed with a dragon. obviously lower quality and all that but very cheap
Magum +
Not too shabby. That's barely an increase
Pog
you gotta use it on odrive, just to show what speeds are possible, even with trerrible surface quality
ooooooooooh, cant wait to see that run
ah good
actually 3, will the 5:1 make high speed printing harder
and whys the version with a hotend included only $2 more
if your cooling is sub par the gears will melt the filament
looks good, only 2 concerns
true but it means worser retractions
sharper heatzone to heatbreak is best and least transfew upwards is best
regular metal
Yeah I was getting a separate psu and mosfet anyways. Just wanted to avoid mains
And if I do my wiring wrong then theres a chance the entire houses breaker flips and anyone working gets screwed
Not so much
House fires give you time to respond, grabbing live wires
Ive got fire alarms and extinguishers and those balls that explode and put out fires
True but I can deal with fire but not ac voltage
for someone whos thorough and builds reliable stuff i would say go ahead but i'd rather avoid anything to do with mains
i dont like mains voltage
ah true, welp a skr pro allows for a speperate input for the bed power so you could buy a 24v psu and use the potentiometer to turn it down to 15v
well this is also applicable for heaterbeds
but a stepd down converter would let you change a 12v heater running on 24v to 13-16v for higher wattage
misread that
my bad
that guy doubled the voltage
but running a 15/30W heater at 28/34v should give you reasonable voltage
just grab the block and put it back
psh
i dont see why not, just use a lower duty cycle
90w
I think a 60 watt heater at 36v is equivalent to 125 watt
why not supply a higher voltage to the heater and use a 30w heater, you would get more performance for less, just use a lower duty cycle
and you are one lucky, lucky man
jesus christ, took a peruse through their website
so, slice engineering is in florida, which i visit often (family so that looks like a good summer job)
so what email would i use, i guess it doesnt matter really, i suppose i send my request along with a portfolio of work ive done
thank you for all the help man
ah fair enough
ah, through sheer luck, do you know of any registry of companys or a way to find companys
Although I can volunteer and they can give me rejects as a favour
lol
how did you come across it
im 1 and a half yeras away from working (also 16)
i have shit loads of free time and i cant get a job so spending time on repairs is better than spending money
holy moly, how much would it cost for you to mail me a joblot of rejects
whadda mean what gets thrown away
wait
oo boy, if i can come home arms ful of rejected parts, i could save soo much money
oh noooo, high end stuff, woe is me becoming a apprentice/free labourer for rejects from the production line
guess i know where im applying for apprenticships in the summer
really
wait
and i have no clue how to find it, i think e3d is uk based so their at least in my country
lucky af, i cant find anything 3d printer related near me
lpt: remove anything after the .html in the link
they are all a little loose until tightened, and oh my god are the blocks from tl gorgeous
materials are fairly cheap, especially when 3d printing cosmetic items, most cost is wear and tear + my interaqction and labour
and a ruler for measuremeants
psh, real pros use a hacksaw and sand paper
it better be for 500
No flow control or retraction
Imagine if it functions as well as 3 stacked volcanoes
I cant wait to trianglelab to clone one of these high performance hotends
Some tormak is wizzing around and doing it
They aren't machining by hand
Bruh. You wot
Completely reasonable
Psh that's silly, ill just plug a heater straight into the wall
Well a small bed heater duct taped around the hotend, right? But I do think you could make one, they exist for beds and use a ssr so why not hotend
It should be. But you can always upgrade later on to a ac heater
Let us know when it arrives
Oooo
but less fricion
yes
nice
thank you, are they expensive ones or cheap ali ones
or lube
thank you, can you compare without any grease
nice, tell me how it goes, also i wonder if it would help on idlers too
what in, and where
I dont think it matters for this but i think on the idlers and on the block you would reduce a lot of friction so possibly higher speeds
but it would need to be high temp, or else you're gonna gas a lot of unsuspecting customers
<@!825681531448197131>  if you make a supernova, what about a vanta black painted hotend called blackhole
one to get it melted and one to keep it hot but not too hot so that small details arent terrible
yep, top block hotter, bottom block cooler
and use 2 heaters in series or parallel powered by relay of sorts or mosfet (dunno which is best)
but this monster is only for occasions
my printer needs to be as cheap as possible and go speedy quick
yup
now i just need to stop the heatbreak from snapping
i think imma use 2 volcano blocks connected by a hacked apart nozzle
cheers
and what discord is that
what are the dimensions of his hotend, or do you not know
welp, i guess ill be buying some aluminum and making hot swap cables for crap but fast prints and normal, but good prints
i guess it gets better flow than volcano
i gotta do that, so its a chunk of volcano nozzle inside a aluminum block plus heatbreak and nozzle
is his custom or just a expensive commercial one
Yes but slice is mass manufacturing with small or no lead times
Alright fair enough, thats a good design
Also, share away. You're trying to sell something so I would love to hear about your product
Your hotend still uses groove mount right. And requires pliers to change the nozzle
Honestly it sounds like hes saying had he been in your shoes he would have gone with a superior design, but idk
Ffs he didn't quote you. He said HE though if the nova hotend had the option it would have used the more modern design
ThAt bar wont be moving
2020
Just use 202
well the magnum+ is a phat block of copper, versus a normal hunk of metal, so i'd say maybe 2x heavier or more
nice, thats gonne look pretty snazzy
seriosuly tho i dont expect any freebies
ya know i can help cleanup a bit too
and ocasionaly something high end, so if i get sent a high end part ill say its great but explain alternatives and then ill go duct tape a printer together for views
but the yt channel is to share the most budget solutions and builds possible, e.g my hotend cost 3 quid brand new. the channel will be me building bang for the buck
yep
yep, thats why i want to start one
im sure you could use your hands to move it fast enough
oh vez has some lying around, ill take one too huh
lucky son of a biscuit
nah he got given it for free
Do I need to join to export parts from the file
Nevrr hear of it. Ill try it out
Hahaha I still use tinkercad since my pc would rather die than try run fusion360
Hey I can take it off ypur hands for a firm handshake
What a steal
Shipping too
Oh gotcha, its not purposefully hidden, just don't have the time
How come we don't release the vzhextrudort plus CAD?
If I'm ever in your area we should definitely get lunch of you're up for it
Awesome!
so excited for you!
AWESOME!!
Figuring out the config still
Fixed it and replaced with a hextrudort plus
I'm not sure tbh, but seeing how it jammed I don't think so
The section at the extruder got ground up
It got stuck inside the hotend and jammed
Wtf
Had a massive jam
I've been using some of that filament from Uzy (from smrrf)
impressive
damnnn
Can also get EL sheets
Autoclave the size of my house
FUCKING HUGE
Spindle the size of me
5x3x2 metres!
Saw the mills
And today I'm headed to the composite factory
They run it all 24/5
I haven't had the full tour but they have multiple EDM machines (only 3 or so since the finish isn't good enough) and they're revamping the shop since stuff is getting old
The machine shop is crazier
The wind tunnel is fucking huge
Because it's a controlled env
They have filament storage in the wind tunnel area
It was awesome
One of the technicians had a 2kg square of printed ultem 1010 on his desk ü§Ø
They gave me a couple samples, one is a polyjet print with dynamic hardnesses, it's got a crazy silicone like texture. The others a pa6 CF sls model car
And 2 polyjets
They've got 9 or so neo stereolithography printers with custom resins
And they do full print volume prints occasionally in ultem
Massive machine
Saw it yesterday, it's a stratasys f900 ü§Ø
They've got some neat proprietary stuff
I'll be with RP in a couple days
I'm not sure but I think it's a massive stratasys
Just saw a printed ultem part about a meter tall ü§Øü§Ø
They showed me all the company secrets
The elevator passes their car collection too
Went through a white tile tunnel, into a dark glass elevator and came onto a catwalk to the reception
Massive portal vibes on the way in
Y'all ever see McLaren technology centre
I'm glad for Hamilton
Ah it was a good race
Oooh, I'll see what I can do
Do they let us onto the track after the race?
Haha I'm hoping it's McLaren so they'll be in a good mood for my work experience next week
You?
I'm rooting for lando
Eeek
Fingers crossed we stay dry
Agreed, and Perez starting on the pits will be interesting
The weather's gotten nice, I wish it stayed like this, I'd kick back with a blood orange cider and enjoy
I've never watched Motorsport before today üòÇ
Oh yeah I loved their race
Oh I see, I'm not cool enough for grand stand üòÇ
Not sure, it's a 3 day general admission I think
Got soaked in the rain today üòÇ so I'm drying out on the grass
Oh yeah üòé
We managed to get into the grandstands ü§≠
Got free tickets from McLaren racing üòéüòé
Wooo
Awesome üòé
Hey guys, I haven't had much headspace this year for 3d printing, my VzBot is still riddled with issues and doesn't print consistently, I was hoping I could bring it down this smrrf and have the professionals take a look?
well have to loop it at the booth this year
Oh man that's so exciting
Awesome
I assume you got the annex guys on that then
Awesome!!
Oh wow that's awesome
Hahahahaha that's a great screenshot üòÇ
Bambu refers to a dart geometry, it's got raised ridges and a thinner middle section for a good seal and less friction. They have a rubber tip and foam body
i used to play with the diy metal washer ones but only under 100fps
you using the bambu half darts or home cooked?
that fps target seems more reasonable then lol
you play in any leagues?
dang thats gonna sting
what fps are you aiming for?
ooooh thats awesome, the caliburn is such a nice blaster
oh sick
jupp ü§£
im sure ill have it good by then
ill think ill be able to drive up, otherwise train with the vzbot will be interesting
it better be working üò≠ , at least visually its awesome since jay did it
I've done the drive with a printer once, it's not that awful üòÇ
Yeah Manchester this year eh?
ill sort it with him tomorrow üòé
jup
thankfully, jay has a spare so i can get his for the fast shipping
Just to update, prints alright at 150mm/s but not 300 and is almost Def leaking
Was there a batch of faulty Goliath?
I hope that's it, otherwise it's gonna look really silly if it's a error on my side
Maybe it's just some leftover bits, gonna run a longer print tomorrow
At least the vase looks alright
Leeak
Acetone soaked and cleaned, replaced PTFE with some spare Capricorn cut slightly long just in case, hot tightened
Arghhh
Ooznest or Amazon it is then üòÄ
Ah dang, I've got a week off school this week
How fast would they get here, I'm basically broke rn so options are spend the last bits on a nozzle from ooznest or play the waiting game
Both threads are about half the length of a normal v6
Which one
Both thread into a V6 block, onss hardened steel and 0.8mm j think and the other is really crappy brass
I have two spares to hand üíÄ
already installed üôÇ , what other modules are good to have. ive got gab3d
heatbreak would be alarming ü§£
nozzle
brb
ü´§  ive been on volcanos for so long not sure if i have any v6's around. i rememeber having a hardened steel somewhere
maybe its because im using a crap CHT knockoff?
im worried if i push harder itll snap, but the leak is definitely between the nozzle and hotend as i can see it dripping out of there
now to solve the leaky hotend
üòê
y offset 21, mesh min 20
thanks pb
ohhh duh i thought that was z
would you guys lend me a hand
and i get a move out of range error whenever trying to mesh calibrate
ugh, even after hot tightening at 300c my goliath is leaking
I'll do my best üòÅ
Jay included a cartographer too
Jup, pretty much everything is finished, hasn't pushed plastic but it's moved and config is done üòéüòé
Almost couldn't fit it in the car üòÇ
It looks fantastic
All my family are oohing and aaahing
5hr drive home with this fella
Printer acquired üòéüòé
What do the comments say
otherwise its gonna be a long day of waiting
is there any way to automative it?
ah gotcha, human run test
how do you know when the test has ended
the relay would be stationary and magnets on the toolhead no?
I'm finally making decent joints
I've used it for a couple reflows and all my daily soldering
It's great
Hey <@451709396280410132> I got the pinecil now!
so a DIY swap to 0.075 sense improves perf, thats a easy mod to remove some VFA
sweeet
depending on jays availability i could snipe that 330
does the high temp cause the grease to soften and leak out? or is it just cheap components being cheap
That's awesome
thats a large section of waste material, could it be used for different brackets
kind of a side thing, but would adding parts to the center add cost
could always message mellow and ask for a discount since youre on ‚ú® the team ‚ú®

i know that message is a bit of a mess but tldr - even keeping it for just a year is enough money to completely change your life for the better. having a sahm spouse and retiring early is a dream
my dad did something similar for a while - i think the longest he went was 3 weeks at one time - the work he put in there put us in the position to move towards central london (hes always dreamt of living here). if your girlfriend can take the added stress i definitely think its worth it. especially since the extra money you earn can be put into investing for your son's and your own future
happy birthday <@509772297289072653> , its been a wonderful few years in this team and im so glad you gave me the opportunity to be here
What brand would be good
Can I get a medium
Count me in
Awesome
hey is it too late for me to grab one too
maybe aluminium sls
What about manually homing it for speed runs
Ohh yeah
also a bit silly, but use sensorless homing and ditch all the fasteners for the endstop
i seem to remember you having a lathe?

Do you know if it's a long term project or a 6 month program kinda thing
How's your gf feel about it
Dude this sounds so insane
Omg
We'll just buy them

Pro tip
can you see the machining marks?
DAMN THE UN ANODIZED LOOKS SEXY ASF
enclosure or no? during the summer my unenclosed cr10 clogs on PLA
ah im about halfway through my build, and ive got a biiig backlog of PLA to print through before i move to ASA
is the kit a goliath air?
Ah fair enough, if they're tough then I'll do like you with some nuts, do you have a pic of that
Would you be able to do the motor mount spacers in Alum too
Just one then for me
Ah cool, so they're optional
Surely two, since the tube screws in through it
I'd buy one
Nah, I prefer that to be more minimal
what else have you custom cnc'ed for your printer? have you thought of making the motor spacers in aluminium?
im in for everything, i think i need: 2 endstop on gantry, 1 Endstop holder printhead, 4 Belt Clip, 4 bed knob. for a total 31 euro + worldwide shipping (unless UK falls into the Europe category)
Also do you still have any of the other CNC parts, I've finally got a job and a lot of spare money
How much would you part with them for?
next time my family asks where im spending all my money, im showing them that video
<:chefkiss:890007032965521448>
the lighting and the smoke is so dramatic
this goes hard
holy shit
One of those lense that clips onto a iPhone, but chuck it on a picam or whatnot
Nah nah
Just get a iPhone clip on fisheye lense
time to beg my school then
ahhh
otherwise imma need mellow expedited shipping
i think ill have to get into school and ask to usr their drill press
but the 10mm fits into the channel and gets stuck
5mm hole was okay
okay
Pencil marks then üòé
Sick
Cool cool, my calipers aren't scratching it tho, how precise does this need to be
How do I mark out the 10mm on the aluminium extrusion
Cool
Ohhh
cool
larger or smaller than the hole diamter
5mm?
for a 5mm drill bit, what size centre punch do i need
thank you so much
not too bad
okay so parts to buy, if mellow doesnt want to do quick shipping, 5mm drill bit, 10mm drill bit, 5mm center punch
cool im ready
Oh crap, gimme 5m
im also just not sure what tools id need
if ive got a jig then ill be fine to do it, whats a good design to print?
ill print a jig for sure. drill bit wise - it doesnt ssay the screw size in the docs but its m5 right? so a 5mm drill bit, m5 tap? and a counterbore bit?
are you sure, i dont have any of the tools to cut those holes, im not even sure what id need to buy
also is it reasnable to ask he does expedited shipping on these drilled extrusions?
should i do both?
i treid discord first
üòÖ
but im still paying back my parents for the printer
next paycheck i can get myself decked out with tools
Would mellow do extra speedy shipping
I've waited 2 months, time to wait one more üòê
Hey <@509772297289072653> sorry to bug you, but some of my extrusions are missing the holes
I gotta figure out what screws go with this anyways
Yeah can't skip those out
üòî best I've got is imperial drill bits on a power drill
Fuck me, I've got none of the tools to fix it
Ughhhhh
Rotated between photos
These are 460mm
Not here
üíÄ
Through the center?
Man I'm bad at this building stuff
First step of building the frame, following the docs website
330
Im just seeing solid extrusions
But there's nothing close to that with holes
Docs say 460, but maybe they're 470?
Did they forget to drill them?
Where's the 460mm extrusion with 2 holes
I feel like an idiot but I'm stuck at the first build step
assuming im starting with nothing spare
but what exactly is needed that the kit doesnt have
sorry to pester
I don't pay tax üòé
I'm below threshold
Ohhh
I forgot about that, is it deducted automatically? Do I pay that manually
The paycheck wasn't that big
Hang on
Or what wiring stuff to get
I don't have any wiring stuff though, so that's what I'm mostly concerned about, idk what else needs buying
I've got a 3b ready to go
I've got my first paycheck, so today is budgeting day, gotta figure out what didn't ship with the 330 kit, what I need for some side projects and what I have left
THIS GUY üí™üí™üí™
And is on summer break
Swole ass biceps
Who's got two thumbs
Bros
The job is even worse
brutal little dudes
üòÖ  ive babysat my younger cousins who are like that. i saw one jump off a windowsill and deliver a flying kick to the stomach once
Also would you chip in for the commute
Can I use the child labour to build my 330
I get 30 quid to sit and look pretty
Pools closed til 5 30
I show up at 4
Start at 4 15 til 7
Got offered double wage to work today
but you cant blame the guy for savouring that printer
cause i have to wait
and then put it right back in the box
i spent two hours looking at my vz330
this is sick
im so pumped
Ooh sick giveaway
Then harden them after cutting
Whoever supply's him with rails should send them unhardened
Meant to add
Huh the message sent 3 times but not the other messages
I wonder if they'd ship those rails unhardened
I wonder if they'd ship those rails unhardened
I wonder if they'd ship those rails unhardened
Ah so pre hardening is the right timr
Would keeping or cold or keeping it hot reduce the warping
im gonna make sure i have a couple spare parts onhand, cause once those youtube videos go live, its gonna be a while until everything is back in stock
thats all the best youtubers, i cant wait to see their videos, and hopefully having so many youtubers will give mellow  a boost
i cant remember the name for it. but its like *the * thing everyone compares to
i think its become a reference point for a good hotend
yeah i had that in lockdown, left for 4 months and came back loving it
yeah im getting sick of my office, all this studying is killing me. if i could build my kit in the backyard i would
if we tried pressure washing our fence, wed get a lovely window into the neighbours yard. the poor fence is barely standing
üî•
cold
Careful man, you're gonna give me a beachfront property
üíÄ
Two in series?
Oh dang
Houston we have liftoff
And most of GCSE isn't even correct
Bleugh
I've looked at a couple a levels
<:sadge:1004524978240229386>
man im looking forward to university
so some arent exactly dificult
tbf i finish the pjhysics axam 45 minutes into a 105 minute exam
your test have to be harder then
Though they change every year
Geography 58
Whereas physics is around 68%
RE is disgusting tho, around 90+ percent for a top mark
I'm just thankful some grade boundaries are so damn low
Yep üò≠
2-3 per subject
It's how GCSEs go ü§∑
My first exam is tomorrow, 23 total this month then it's VzBot building time üòéüòé
Vz150 at smrrf?ü§®
Almost wishing I could sell my current printer for a 150 aswell
Ayy very nice
is it mostly the dc or AC side
dang i gotta catch up on what needs ordering
just to clarify, every wire needed (but loose) or just most
i was just about to ask ü§£  mine arrives tuesday, yours?
yup
for when you dont want rscs
as a alternative
i thought  a single flap across the whole body would be better no?
thats so fuckin cool, added functionality to an already established system üòª
would it be wrong to register myself at vz200 even if my build isnt 100% complete
(it was a hour long cross country thing)
bunkec our last lesson
NOPE üòé
I will *never* have to learn latin, religion or English again üòé
I'm only keeping physics and maths next year
Had my last ever chemistry lesson today (I'm the guy on the left with glasses)
hey I have some ideas for the table, just wanted to see what you guys were thinking of displaying
dm it looks like
i dont like pinging everyone
is that okay?
üôè thank you, I'm so excited to build the vzbot I've been jittery all day ü§£
I've been meaning to print a Mando helmet for a while
It's big boy toy time. Vzbot AWD 330 üòéüòé
the sex appeal will be insane
just imagine, all metal printers + watercooling loops
also nice idea for the table, setup a hard tube water cooling loop thats free standing. so we have steppers, hotend, pi?, drivers all connected to a pump and reservoir  using some coloured coolant and add a bubbler in there so people can see the flow
what a flex
fuck yeah
if i make a nice build, i could potentially bring it to smrrf?
üéâ
MY PARENTS HAVE AGREED TO LET ME GET A KIT
BOYS
Damn that's a sexy PI
gah dayum

<@276016956245540864> the request a serial id message should probably be revised, i changed a couple parts above^
this is the original (2 years and 3 days old):

Vez and I made some discussion on what we think makes a unique VzBot.
Because a printer is not made by one special property, we decided you need a few things to fit into the VzBot Printers.


1 - you need to use the same gantry style that comes with the VzBot and a frame that closely resembles the original design 
2 - You need a similar printhead. Because the orignal VzBot uses the Goliath hotend, which is not affordable for everyone, we will also accept other hotends. 
3 - Your printer should have a clean overall picture. It should not looks messy or just be thrown together. 
4 - Your printer must be able to print. For this video evidence is mandatory. **Please upload this video to YouTube, imgur or a similar platform**, and share the link via discord.
<@509772297289072653>  just flip this switch
Then you've got 2 powerful lights, one practical the other crazy bright
If you're interested in buying I'd recommend getting a ns14 instead from taobao and get a Jin Heng light too
Nightwatch ns59v2
Had 3 security guards follow me for a bit before stopping me to ask about the lights
Just had a flashlight enthusiast rite of passage üòÇ
And I'm 16
üò≠
We weigh the same
And I hit 32.5
They hit 85kg on bench
Benching with a friend üò≠
VzKnife with speed stripes for my uk lads ??
hahaha, its just a smart lightswtich
jlcpcb is one sponsor i dont mind watching in videos, you can always shoehorn it into a watercooling vid for example. make a breakout board for free and get sponsored
Not to sound greedy, but is there a team discount for mellow product (the kit)
ü•µ
oh nvm, just got the message request today!!!
Hey <@509772297289072653> wanted to check if I'd be able to snag a kit this release, if not I can wait til next time, I've just got 3 months off this summer which is perfect for a build
wont be able to drink tho üòÖ
its only a couple hours away by tube
if i can convince a friend to go ill see if i can make the dates work
is it this summer or next summer?
im currently gaslighting myself into thinking i enjoy the gym
max pr was 3x 30
i started a couple weeks ago
damn 90kg???
Time to shake my poor cr10 to peices
added oled and rgb lighting on the screen: 12m/s
330 preferably üôèüôè
i finally got the parents onboard and got enough money
hey vez if you wouldnt mind- could you put a word in with ming about me getting a kit
You Vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
I'll wait for the DM from Ming before asking then ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Is there any discounts for mellow that I can use?
I guess if I manage to snag a vzbot kit I'll buy a beacon
I was thinking i should message ming to make sure there's no cutoff date for the form
Are you also getting a kit
Feeling the hype üéâüéâ
Filled out the form a couple days ago to get a kit
<:dab:931268940217339905>
Cause screen share you should have 1080p 5/30fps
Camera quality or screen share?
How'd it go?
Only with OBS or other manual recordings
otherwise normal old vc works
they can request to speak and you can bring them on stage
if you want to stream wirthout other people talking use the stage
awh man the first night 2 weeks i cant stick around for it
They should add a 4inch LCD üòé
damn, you're too kind to us üôè
That's all we need really
What's the dimensions of a benchy
Mgw03 and a teeny weeny CF tube
New X axis?
Hmm
ah yeah, later today ill run it again
not to pester, but did the driver settings help
oh well, still impressive eh
but on one monitor its a bit of a struggle
i love watching either discord chats or youtube while working
i really want a discord/word/youtube monitor
üéâ
18th of this month
off topic, but is there plans for another round of kits? i know the first were beta but are there concrete plans to go again
I think I've got most parts on hand already
I'm thinking of building one and wanted to hear your impressions
The v0 inspired mod specifically
Have you guys seen the rook
+300g
*they * mount it to the toolhead
we mount steel metal serial plates to the frame, but thats boring, a static fixture
Whole thing at 48v and some metal contacts
Ehh?
Electrified frame
How about
Holds it at any position
Ez pz
Retractable lanyard holder at the center
ahh thats a while away
im right near london, where are you headed?
promotion?
ah nice
whats the occasion?
so for a couple pissing contests its good, otherwise no need to get thermal paste
i reckon with some good thermal paste you could crank a lot more current into the motors, tho i dont know if that would make it go any faster overall?
thats currently doing it dry right? so with better contact you could get cooler
would a little thermal paste help at all, one time install and just stick some paste on 2 large contact points
is that an apples to apples comparison?
damm, so ~30c difference on one motor
idk if they'd do it but 3djake is one of my favourite online UK stores
sharp bend
sorry, for clarity sake, should i remove the f3d support role then?
he coping so hard rn
on stream?
nah thats perfectly reasonable, id agree with that
Personally he's free to send me a test kit üòâüòâ
He also wants to do a vz150 kit
ty ty
the qaulity is slightly worse than midjourney but ive got some really great results
i gotta eat but if you want i can walk you through it later
local install will save you a lot of money then, stable diffusion is very easy to set up
also i think its parti or scribe from google that does better text rendering. the ai model for stable diffusion is 900 million parameters total which isnt very much so its not focused on words or letters being correct, easiest way around that is just manually running small img2img passes
what pc do you have?
nor as easily
just not at such a high quality
you can!
Or was that pure txt2img
I didn't know they let you do img2img
How'd you make them
Dang those are sick
see ----> <@509772297289072653>  thats edited in after i sent
yeah editing in a @ doesnt work
you gotta @ people otherwise no push notification
All around good news
Plus a couple had their houses searched and police found a ton of phones
And just got news that a large group of 15+ got arrested for mugging people, carrying a knife, assault and battery
Off topic, but 4 more people from my school got mugged by likely the same people that mugged me
i dont know if ill be much help but my summers got a couple gaps, id be happy to stop by
how'd your injure it the first time <@570580651569446912>  <@509772297289072653>
Nichrome is pretty impossible to solder to cause the oxide layer, is that the same reason it doesn't short
Finally back on after almost a decade
Saw the meridian laser today
*(hes going to compete)*
what?????
broo
I thought you were around my age
Wait how old are you
i wouldnt make anyone buy a printer for someone else
gotta be the youtuber
true true, wanna have it perfect before shipping to the mass
hey vez have you seen if any of the big yt guys would want to build vzbot. Nero would prolly build
its gonna collide with the z frame üò¢ , not gonna fit
Gonna need a lot of changes tho
I'm thinking of rebuilding my cr10 to use the vztool head
3 of one colour, 18 of the other i thought?
i think there were only 3 to start, two of the silver have sold tho
hey <@509772297289072653> might wanna @ builders/owners for the handles, in case people miss it
i can go check with mine while its idle
is it in use?
hey vez if you feel like another live event, we can try discords "stage" feature thatll allow you to stream and might drive some more discord traffic. tho if its too much hassle stick to youtube
hey vez i dont have anthing to mount to now but could i snag one later (~5-6 months)
you were right about that for sure, people already drooling over them
yeah
so i can upggrade phone and torch
i get more money than i put in originally
or trades
since most of my items were second hand or really good deals
mugging is net positive
lil update
at least police showed up ~5 minutes after we got off the phone with non-emergency services
got some insane deals for used +aliexpress specials
yeah, just looking now, i think insurance will pay almost double what i did for all my items
ive been itching for an upgrade anyways eh
its factory reset so no worries there, plus it sells for 50 quid used. the torch is likey the most expensive
they gut bugger all off me
ü§£
nah 35 cents
yeh they got a whopping 35p in cash off me (plus phone and all that)
im all fine tho
got mugged
boys i cant catch a break
cant find mine either üòÖ
which now that i think of it
hes saying hes missing the confirmation email saying his is on the way
sorry i dont know what it should look like, but are the corners meant to be cut off? and should there be a small square of alu?
just watched a guy beat his extruder on a table
facebooks a whole other beast
bruh whats the issue in that pic
lo siento no hablo espa√±ol
Idk South Africa's got a lot of issues too tho
Man that's messed up. No nine year old deserves that
Yeah, i can't say I know what it was like before, had a four guys my age trying to start shit when I was out with my little brother in the snow
Well. To use the headset, had to, otherwise its a very nice paperweight
Just can't get excited for flatscreen anymore
It's the best, I got pcvr 4 months ago and already got 100 hours
I had to make one a couple years ago for üòé VR GAMING üòé
Matt Weinberger
i may as well while we're at it
damm, looks similar ig. that extruder still tiny tho
gah damn, even in non studio conditions that looks beautiful. and tiny, is that keyboard from the logitech keyboard+mouse bundle
oh damn, how come. ill have to buy asap then
how'd you get for free
nop
ah cool
oh sick, how do you know beforehand?
or are they full factories dedicated to hotrunner hotends
will lots of clones will be rejects or spares of actual hotrunners with modified parts?
¬£25 ?!
i can work at my local leisure center, less than a minute from my school. tho the pay is abysmal ¬£9 an hour. but at my age, money is money ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
when the secod half of my class passes we're going out to celebrate
ty ty
im certified üòé
ive passed my lifeguarding exam
boys
im getting beaten by a 11yo üíÄ
if ive got a vzbot i can bring it with me
split the shipping
might get someone too buy one with me
such a good deal
Thats the noctus 3d one
That's unfortunate, they made it sound so good
Deez what üò≥üò≥üò≥
What's catbutt sorry?
The brushed metal silk looks great. But glossy tpu has a knack for looking awful
The overhang on the block is fine. Just not perfect. But I couldn't do any better
Yeah just the light then
But you can't see it without zooming in and looking for it
If I'm pedantic I'd say the overhangs on the block look funky in a couple spots and the tpu just always look like that
And you can't just upgrade that
Same, my 3060ti just doesn't have the vram I need
was it free?
ü•µ drip
ah most my wardrobe is random cybersecurity companies tshirts
when we say "free stuff", we talking hotends/steppers etc? or shirts and merch etc
ooh good luck
what exams do you have coming up
üíÄ same (at least should be)
very nice, whats everyone else spent their weekend doing?
fun bird fact: birds go wee wooo wee
then did it
especilly if they changed their name to vez
it would be a shame if someone said that in general
mhm
then whip out the /tts
so we do a lil @ here and get everyone to look
it only soudns for anyone with the channel open
gosh! <@323961338412138497> did you know /tts is on üò± , its a good thing no one would abuse that to say funny things in general so everyone with discord open hears it
who added all those rude emojis üò°
/s
<@323961338412138497> so crass, jeeez
ill be honest, dont know much about that. but that sounds like a good thing no? that their government invests in them
that doesnt sit right with me
"big companies living high on government "
arent they a uni incubator company
"holier than thou" is what comes to mind when i read that
and i wonder how little money that is to them
i wonder which hotend theyre talking about
> we are donating $600 (5x the price of a certain hotend) to the Sanjay Mortimer Foundation to show our support for the 3D printing community
> don‚Äôt feed the exploiters....They are big companies living high on government subsidies ......They drain the life of true innovators and cheat and steal at every opportunity
`The end result is bad faith infringement threats and licensing demands that require companies to spend a significant amount of money to settle these claims without any addition to the public good`
seems *they * cant read the dictionary
> A patent troll is a derogatory term used to describe a company that uses patent infringement claims to win court judgments for profit or to stifle competition.
link says
> If you are a hater that likes to accuse us of being patent trolls, please use a dictionary before you hurl pejoratives. A patent troll is a person or company that buys up patents in a fire sale with the sole intent of exploiting companies with commercially available products for profit.
from the "hahahha its ceramic" id assume ceramic
oooh, nice!
*may be repurposed for other uses
spacer +plastic card == hotend stand for ez assembly üòâ
bit of a sily idea, but double ended screws with a nut on the middle?
how come?
reprap.org/wiki/Budaschnozzle 

wait thats wht the patents for right
a/b are certainly standoffs in compression
A B K, all  from reprap forum from 2014
10k üò±
ah so may as well get started on the opposing the new patent
ill be able to get a job soon, ive go no bills to pay. this is as good a use as any
how much?
also basic mk8 hotend (i think) uses spacers in compression
or does it need to be a sold item
thatd be easy enough no? the old reprap forums are full of similar designs with standoffs
almost looking like klippers "perfect graph" example
Only in China?
did you ask if mellow knows them?
I have some money saved, it's not much but I can donate it to get a lawyer
Maybe we kick/quarantine them
Also are there any slice accounts in the discord
Goliathe? And they sell generic ceramic spacers for "creality hotend" that happen to be compatible
more like kicking the bees in the balls
i feel like ill be outclassed pretty easily
how about we all submit samples. best gets the kit?
if images suffice, i might maybe be able
tempting. but alas, no skill üò¢
its either poorly executed genz humour or just he didnt understand the imlplications of the song
its so funny, probably opened trending on tiktok and copy pasted a song
ah yeah, people arent too happy
how come
<@210780931303276544> ill be your best bud and make your gf happy, just send all of that to my adress
so that cpap will be delayed
just a heads up, mellow is stuck in lockdown for at least 6 days
ooh nice
oh my poor wallet
can you truly put a price on quality control?
old funky parts? new stuff? strange experimental electronics? im in
i volunteer for anything
already broke rule one ü§£
wow nice, its crazy to think, it makes sense for you to visit china. for business. thats just crazy
hm, idk if we all get free beta unit but i suppose i can just sell the one in the kit if i buy
does it have hotend included?
Oh well. I'm sure I'll be able to snag one either way
Idk the page showed a 235 I thought
cant decide between 235 and 330, ill do awd just unsure of the rest
<@509772297289072653> do you know what parts will be included in the full kit, im thinking of buying one
either im missing the point or youve he the stepper drive gear where the filament gear goes?]
Hey wait a minute ü§®
I kinda get both points. If you overtorque a nozzle what's that do?
they get ~170g/h i think, what can we get out of the vzbot +lsd
ü•µ
cant say ill do much with it bud itd be cool to look at, game@matthewweinberger.com
You sure? Coulda sworn he was my age
Hahahaha they're doing damage control on their own shitshow about our printer
kek
as i see it. we arent the server telling our members to behave, they are
bbro waiting for someone to respond to his message ''your a idiot''
thyere talking about lsd.  i think they dont mind the goliath
personally, not a woman. cant comment on that
true true, just some people seem to see it as hostile to women
hm, the lsd naming seems a little....ùò§ùò∞ùòØùòµùò≥ùò∞ùò∑ùò¶ùò≥ùò¥ùò™ùò¢ùò≠
watcha doing with the left overs?
more rotor inertia? i cant remember if that impacts accel
pheew, at least its back. youtube is always a little janky
are you big enough yet to have a direct contact with youtube, i swear they have community managers that you can talk to
ü•µü•µ
we're around the 300g is weight right
hes too funny. he knows its a stupid big amount of weight and hes just poking fun
ohhh hahaha
what time?
its not a fantastic edit but something like that maybe?
and inside was foam and the light
it was a nice smooth premium feeling cardboard sleeve
lemme try find my favourite packaging
ASD might be better. Adequately Sized Dong. similar vein for naming but not a drug
border control also remebers that name
Happy birthday!!! <@509772297289072653>
ü§î
we make the nozzle hole long
what if
spray some good ol wd40 in there
if you dont want it at the end/if it doesnt work etc id be honoured to use it on my printer
woah thats sick, so it flows through the pipe
i was hopiing the brown stain was chocolate
and a 150 sanitation fee since i sat on his couch and wiped it down
and 107 for emotional harm
9.99 unprecedented covid fee
2.8 convenience fee
plus 34 processing fee
20 quid refund
idk but i kinda want a refund
expected more as a guest tbh
very stuttery
didnt say it was streaming well <:sadge:1004524978240229386>
and streaming....4k üò±
im using your wifi
look at your couch devin
too late
did you buy them to fix a problem or just for the heck of owning
let us know how they are
you EU guys can have
ah rip
depends what country, but if the other two cant, ill have
Caulk?
Depending on which direction the fins go you could print a case and run water across it pretty easily
full control?
well thats sick
ill even boil it
¬£10 and ill make you a reeeally nice grilled cheese
I'll pay maze to fly over and build it
For me üëâüëà
Honestly at that price, you might find print on demand services to be cheaper
I know times a big factor but you could probably fit the vzbot onto two 300mm plates
Yeah no harm in selling, just funny pricing.
do we have anyone in other countries
how far into the video are people watching? you could always aim for a couple minutes less than the average watch time? i think? im not too sure how this youtube business works
i liked the long form, i dont know if itd be too much work, but a highlight reel in the first 10 and then normal vid would be awsome
And I don't think I'd have the same attitude towards learning as I do today without you guys (especially maze )
You've all been so welcoming and helpful
I think I can honestly say, everything I achieve in life will be thanks to you guys
No complaints from me, you guys are all awesome, I always close this server in awe
Guy on discord üòéüòé
I think, I haven't watched to that part yet
I'm internet famous üòéüòé, thanks man
I wonder how the cables look under uv
Looks sick tho
Cables spell out Bob ü§£
well damians certainly confident
oh well
look in <#857878337703247872>
fair enough, the instability is quite annoying tho
ÔΩÉÔΩèÔΩèÔΩå„ÄÄÔΩÜÔΩèÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩîÔΩîÔΩâÔΩéÔΩá„ÄÄÔΩîÔΩàÔΩè
ah those are the less ethical uses
mainly for the formatting, role colours in vc and a translate option built in
how come, i quite like better discord
i see, i think the plugin got discontinued anyways. soon itll be outdated thankfully
why's it called that?
would you mind talking to him, this stuff all goes over my head, its 0xDamian#2418
is that all fine ?
i am trying to get into rc airplanes though, which has been challenging
no change so far, still saving up, im hoping to build it in 5 months (ill have ~4 months off school) but i applied to this scholarship thingy where they give you 600 quid to put towards any project
dont worry, you can be second worst. im on tinkercad üòé
which is why u thin it first
bend it around a printed jig
then bend?
cut between the fins to thin it
lemme get a photo
for the stepper heatsink, could a diy one be made buy cutting along the fins and just bending them
cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1003833877384675418.webp?size=48&quality=lossless
<:wesmart:890660011531989072>
ohhhhhhh
how will you run the water through it? not sure i get how it would work
like drill a hole through it? and stick a pipe to it?
or is there another, cause thatd be a huge coincedence
but even the smallest AIO cpu coolers can handle 75W CPUs afaik so a 120mm radiator should be enough for a hotend
i dont know exactly how much cooling capacity you need
aliexpress, pumps are super cheap, tubing would probably one of the more expensive parts. a reservoir could be diy'ed from a water bottle,  and the radiator might be costly
like cut it into slices and glue onto the case?
is that better, im never really sure how to interpret these
so the new one has a higher peak ?
whats the ie3 vs ie4 mean?
For shipping it in?
What's the foam for?
maybe 200
ill wait
yeh alright
just register without any photos and fill it in later
any wayi can reserve vz111
any landing you can walk away from is a good one
i only cuased minor damage to the frame
I'm not a very good pilot tho
Finally got my RC airplane working
its wigglin around a lot
thats not good right
oop missed that, that looks great
all good then üëç
i suppose the letters will be clearer irl than in the renderanyways
wouldnt happen to have a edm machine lying around?
then whats there now is plenty
yeah, if its reasonable to ask we could poll the boosters and leave it to them?
like this
like the letters get glued into a cutout letter
yeah black in alum and gold in brass/copper
would that be possible?
top quality
lemme draw it
Any chance the txt could be inlayed in that yellowy metal
Get well soon
vz-surgeonBot when?
a straw long enough to reach your office desk
The first one looks good because it can be shorted easily with hand tools
Trianglelabs looks like a very short path, dunno if it's effective
Wait wait. Lemme rephrase
That one's got such a short section for the water to be heated, idk if that makes a difference tho, cutting and bending that first one looks achievable with some hand tools
Like most things they can be had for pennies on alie
Just spray it in the hotend general direction
High pressure water jet on a controllable gimbal <:thonk:906671607232200756> <:thonk:906671607232200756>
ah i see, gin too? for a fun build expeirience
gonna be like gpus. sold out before the page refreshes
wait 1.2k with all those electronics üòç
im sure i and some other admins would be happy to helpbeta test üòâ
Yeah plenty of people will register for the ‚ú®B L I N G‚ú®
he may have them still
iirc guillame made the original
or just to the next weekend then end after #100
ah true, 7 days post 100 to make sure people at least have a weekend to build
if we're happy with:
copper/bronze lettering and alu nameplate for the winner
random vzbot owner (not admins)
cutoff is day of 100 reached
will be delayed until devins got it fixed

possibly:
name + a short text about reaching 100 inscribed on the back
admins get one (devin chooses cost)


if thats all good should we announce it now or later closer to #100
yeah we can reroll if it ends on a admin
cutoff on the day of 100 then?
we can always run the giveaway and just let people know theres gonna be some delay before it ships (if we hit 100 before 4 weeks)
ill happily pitch in to buy the copper(or brass) and alum
dunno if thats actually makeable tho
i was thinking a metal plate for the printer, alu outer, copper numbering
jason shouldnt have the owner role then?
cool
<@276016956245540864> nikolas messaged me saying both him and jasonfromldo got vz90, are you able to fix that
Not a LSD then
Oh it's 2 years old
Link to the video? Also have they started sale or would that be a factory keeping a couple spares for personal use?
Nah it's 3, they've got a small office with 3 engineers to one side a separate room full of test benches and their inventory
Dude does 3 man r&d pretty much
Destroys competition and makes dick joke in the process
Sends out free gifts
Makes water cooled version
Sends CAD to companies to use freely

I think I agree with frankie
their material list
pekk?
welp, passion project and innovation over stagnation. plus sales. plus know for being the guy that gave a manufacturer full access to their design instead of suing
it'd only an extra 1.5k. which isnt something to scoff at. BUT youve got AON3D wanting a partnership which will likely offer more money plus sales from the LSD.
plus imo id go for the passion project, the thing i care about and made myself over someone else design
im just happy to be here watching you all completely revolutionise hobbyist printing in both quality, affordability and speed
oh man you guys are too cool, devins famous, vez is famous 
you just started production of a fully custom hotend that beats the competition and youre already thinking about how to get parts globally
wow, that looks awsome
just dont have em
ez
best i have is sugar syrup
chew some bubble gum and jam it in there
pritt stick will be fine, right?
will that give you a fun surprise when you heat it up?
Eh just use twine so it can expand freely
Ah cool
100 slot nuts because you dropped them inside or because some parts overused them?
Yeah you can just @ everyone and let them know you're off for a while but there's a lot happening behind the scenes
Wanna do that for market place and stop some of the spam
i love getting to hear all the news before its public üòé
wow thats awesome
im just out of the loop
oh rip
thats cool
is it a cylinder on a stick that runs in a circle around it?
how are the fins done?
Vez had this a while back iirc
Loose pulley, yeah?
if there was a spare broken one itd make a pretty cool memoir/souvenir if casted in resin
cool
Hey what'd you guys do with the old hotends?
fair enough
If you emailed offering a review they'd probably say yes. It's worth trying
No, no problem doing it, just makes me laugh. You're the server owner
The white people don't talk very often
So many messages from people that don't usually read the server, people who join to see news or support the cause. A lot of the owners (yellow people) are active and read/chat often
Also lmao at the @ everyone, most active the server gets (that isnt owners already)
What's the part
lmao, so was that publicly shared or was it some employee shared/leaked the STEP
Vector3D in chat, he probably wants a statement for a yt video
''poor mans''
*$240 *
how muchdoes it cost?
allow us to introduce vzbot industrial style. fast *and* good
If that happens I'll campaign to get it into my school to replace the ultimaker
Just ask why he thinks
I think china ignores prior art entirely
Their chanel is pretty dead
True
They aren't fully removed but they don't get all the same perms as before
It's not a actual discord feature, but we can leave them with their channel but it's private for only us to see and we can have them with a separate role for vendors except less perms
We can shadow ban them as to not burn bridges
goodluck
wish i could drop 10lbs. maybe not the other symptoms though
they want 1000 hotends from you
plus
wow! thats a amazing oppurtunity, and with the same amount of money. its best of both worlds- a job you love and a job with good pay
Finally have a reason to use the three torches I got
Thanks, going hiking for my DofE silver
Just to let you guys know I'm going on a 3 day trip starting Sunday morning, I'll be back late Tuesday
I have lady friends?! Well that's news to me
You know, I'm sitting with a friend telling them about how great this server is and how we hit 50 serialized printers. So they ask to see the discord, I whip out the phone, tell them about the bright minds behind it all. Hand over the phone for them to read a little without checking what was in here. Them 'üòØ wow that's nice'
on the settings page, can you change the welcome message
Who controls the ticket bot
Is the UK count as EU in that case. If not is there anything I can do to help
looks good to me, also did you see what alex said about getting a flow splitter into the hotend
True. Perhaps later when he gets better
I think this would have to be a very closely guided build
No harm in asking though
I suppose vzbot isn't the most beginner friendly
True. But Phil and Nick have been at it a while
Not sure. He could possibly be sponsored by ifixit or some other regular or free parts. I'd send a email laying out a general idea and if he's up to it follow up asking about financial stuffs. He may just drop the cash for new parts or might try tie in a sponsor
No clue if he'd agree to a build but a joint Livestream or a Review vid would be awesome
On a separate note (of you're looking to grow the server a little), jayztwocents (custom PC builder) recently got into 3d printing- Two videos in two weeks about buying new printers. I'd consider emailing him about doing a build
I think mellow is still dealing with the lockdowns
How much do they cost and do they have mgn9 size too
Oh damn. 90g difference for the whole gantry
Wait we're shipping recreational drugs now?
Just remember to lift with your spine not your knees
Does it have a website to visit for contorl or is it just funky
No commands were sent for it
Maybe someone fiddled with the settings
GitHub bot got funky
Nope, he deserves it
üò¨ I guess if I can get some more 3d modelling gigs I'll buy one
I regret not spending the money now
Teensy weensy. When I visited it was 3 small ish room with 3 or 4 engineers  plus dan who gave the tour
I may go that rout for my build
Fair enough
second hand old pcs can be fairly cheap
true
installing klipper isnt too painful
hopefully it doesnt get much rougher
just wanted to check
ah cool
*with credit
hey maze did you know nuctus is selling the powerbrr
text is a .scad which imports the plate
text and bottom plate are separate peices and openscad combines the two and edits the text
Yeah I think so. It wouldn't work without
and how do i run that
damn, well thats far out of my skill range. whered you learn that?
ah thats far out of my knowledge
heres the scad, it should work without changes
cmd line spits this out afterwards 

C:\Users\matth>openscad -o VZ.stl -D 'SRnum = "hello";' --export-format binstl serial_plate_front.scad
Usage: openscad.exe [options] file.scad
Allowed options:
openscad -o VZ.stl -D 'SRnum = "hello";' --export-format binstl serial_plate_front.scad 
ive got this command so far, ive got to go eat but if anyone wants to mess with it feel free.  im not too sure whats wrong with it tbh
ive got a variable, now i gotta do fun command stuffs
gimme 30m
i think ive got it
edit first line to say       import("serial_plate_front.stl");        otherwise (for me) i get a error
in case you cant find it
i c\an poke around at it
why pay for a red LED when you can just have a Red wire
''oh wow the hotend turns into a puddle for easier shipping''
is it a addon or overall hotend theyre selling
That makes sense, if you ever need it I've got the space
Hey f3d I know that xo suggested a distro center in the UK, of that's something you want to do I have half a annex for keeping parts in, it stays fairly dry in there (under 50% relative humidity) I'm happy to keep some stuff in there
And performance is close 'nuff
What is it
Ah I see
looks good, whats the holes in the feet for
if youre impartial, ask mellow i guess. if theyre against it then say sorry already with mellow but if mellow dont mind then give the green light. personally i'd say yes since free stuff benefits everyone
hm
oh yeah its just the same emoji
is it just me or does only the second one give you the builder role?
I wonder what percentage of their total sales are due to you
Ah, but still crazy high numbers
So 2k+
And you've been at it for a year or so
Holy shit 200 in a month
If the engineers have any say I think it'll go through, they seemed quite nice
Happy birthday üéâ
Hm
We can clear the channel and make two threads although you'd have to be more active on there otherwise they archive
where do updates currently go?
no need to deal with using heater ports as heater ports, since it just redirects signal/power
if the cable fits it works
its much dumber
i like carabiner more than the others
hopefully ü§û
this weekend ill be trying some more printing/extruding
nah i havent had time, school is a pain
PP/PET
I've got a suuper early prototype peice of filament that kinda prints
Beat me to it
Bruh
Filament extruder?
Not even sure what he means
It's safe to assume that guy's a üêí
Maybe I should be more famous
Lucky bugger
True but consider if you can keep it you can always give it away, but again it's up to you
Or just your opinion
Is she asking you to review it, like she sends a unit to you and you review
Will the structural heatbreak stay?
Also announcement worked, <:pog:909151185620074546>
Ew plan
i think it came before the prusa mini no?
Awesome, Isnt that conference more industry focused
Are they similar?
Just a thought but would a ender 2 with 2504AC and linear rails and klipper and a minimized bed be faster than a vzbot
tbg has a larger hob
all fixed and now it'll @ announcemnts
actually, i can test
next upload we can see if it worked
forgot part of the command
all done
just ignore for now sorry
ill clean up and public it when done
dw its privated
<@!276016956245540864>  want me to add @announcemnt to the bots msg
xy^2
Quadxy is more pronounceable
I wonder if the worm gear extruder has those issues too?
How?
Couldn't drive that tho
So every side of filament has contact
Oh wait what about a set of two opposite each other and then rotated 90 degress
How would you arrange those bearings without bending the filament
For high speed low friction
Ptfe coating?
i think
tl:dr the way the gears interact causes changes in extrusion force
looks like the issue <@!509772297289072653>  was having
People are trash
The raspi cam?
What was the yt post about
<:sheesh:927939329060388894>
LoL it's so empty
I'm in
Free stuff
H264 is what discord uses I guess. I'll test it later
Filenake is mp4
I think
They are normal mp4
I can refilm, Its encoded in h.265 which is less compatible but more efficient
One peice on the bed, no changes to the settings
More wack artifact
And poor cooling warped the wall
It's vertical artifact and the angled extruder shiz
Sure is
The first side I video has only diagonal artifacts, the y axis has a criss cross of diagonal and vertical artifacts
Hey <@509772297289072653>  I got that artifact you were talking about. Lemme video it. On the y axis there's vertical artifacting and the diagonal type you talked about
1 motor vs 2 and see how the vfas change
Suuuper long x axis with suuuperong belt
I suppose there's ways to test but it'd be more time than I have, I suppose with a ender and some spare extrusion you could test it fairly easily
Any clue why that is. Less vibration sent through the belt per microstep?
Here's the placr
Insanity
Saved 60g
Someone milled most of the guide away
In annex engineering iirc, from dalgaard
So standoffs with s screw through them
Iirc it's standoffs in compression that isn't allowed
maybe instead of spur gears something with an angle that way theres always at least some of the gear in contact, hoefully to fix that artifacting
<:hub:943779463966126090>
its as long as my forearm <:sheesh:927939329060388894>
AC iirc and its for 2.85mm filament
400W
typhoon
<:pog:909151185620074546>
i see they also make extruders, perhaps a veztruder that fixes all that artifacting or just a really huuuge hotend
their stuff is crazy
theyve got a hotend that does 200mm/s^3 and its heater is higher power than my bed <:sheesh:927939329060388894>
and a long bowden might hide completely
a bigger nozzle might make it more obvious, since less backpressure
but back pressure evens it out so its not so blobby and exagerated
do you mean theres tiny sections of rotation where the gear moves without pushing filament then it finally engages and pushes lots of filament then disengages and nothing moves
i even have plans for a fancy glass panel for electrnics
also good news, ive got everything ready for my filament maker. electronics ‚úÖ    firmware ‚úÖ      physical parts ‚úÖ
ah true
imagine if the rest of the hotend had flow splitters
you guys got any clue why
other steppers work fine, its just my bigger stepper that does that
including psu
when i try home it shuts down everything
but
ive got the recycler electrnics all set, just waiting on a 12v heater since my 24v onbe cant heat past 100c
damn, that looks amazing
only one issue
i got my firmware and electrnics setup for the recycler
feel free to abuse
yeah
dont respond
ignore @peopleperson and @lbsi
oh is it your startup, even cooler
personal project or educational?
sick
the hand paralysis glove?
What's the motor for
you can make a private thread with him if you wanna add him to the chat
if they didnt change anything there then theyll do some proper testing hopefully
if they fixed it theyll let you know
i would email bondtech just in case
And wasn't properly licensed or is that something different
It requires supports though right
dalgaard i think it is
if youve got a few designs or iterations to try theres a guy in nnex who offered it a while back
My favorite set of tshirts used to be from a craft store. Nothing to do with status or money
Yeah that, but also my non school wardrobe is the same 3 brands of t shirt in different colors and 3 identical pairs of pants plus one hoodie. Some clothes I just really don't like the feel of. So if I can't try it on I don't buy
Same for annex engineering hoodies
Nah, I'm really specific about clothes so I passed
15
You're all infants compared to my ripe old age
Nah I could be everyone's dad
That's a Beautiful house
I hope it goes through
Here and In a serial request
Is the bot funky or am I formatting the viewbuild command wrong
Well if it'll make you happier I suppose I could find room for the printer /s
Love the color scheme
do printers have feelings? i hit mine by accident and now its just dive bombed into the bed
id love to have one for that reason, but i dont get out often enough for people to see
hahahaha man they reeeeally want vzbot endorsement
Also, was that btt that sent it or Are the two messages separate
Man that looks sick
Alright, too late for me now, ill tell them tommorow
can someone link it, i wanna let him know that the grammar is appalling
and a semi colon wouldve been more appropriate after the first clause of the first message, although that might not be necessary i think it goes either way
and a comma between the ''mike'' and ''but''
put in more effort my dood
smh my head
looks like he forgot a full stop at the start of his message
what a monkey
CNC kitchen just made a new vid about composting 3d prints
ER.gif
Oh no.mp4
Exactly, and like my old man says 'chicks dig scars'
Made the ultimate sacrifice for perfect overhangs
Bruh discord stretched the photo, my thumb doesn't look that weird
The support gods required a blood sacrifice today <:kekw:906674564879233024>
Are those threads on the tip?
Just needs some hot glue
That's a pretty huge milestone, you wanna schedule this one with a event or a immediate release
Damn that klipperscreen looks awesome
happy birthday!
Awsome
That's the plan eventually, but also gotta settle a debate. Someone telling me the machine is easily 1.5k+
Cool so if built new to the same spec, roughly 1k give or take 100
Hey <@795765716925546546>  how much did your printer cost roughly (the one from the video today)
depends where the electronics are mounted i would think, my ssr is very close to the psu and control board so if any of those fail itll probably take everything else with it. but  a hotend/bed failure would be fine since theres sheet metal (steel is what creality uses i think) between them and electrnoics
after a bit more explaining i got it figured out, calibrating e steps for whats a reversed printer is very hard to get your head around
this is too much braining
trying to get marlin working for the filament maker, and im talking to a  guy who already has one. sometimes he makes perfect sense, others he lists speeds in lengths
no hv tho, even with jank mods, right?
At school
I'll have to check once I'm home
Their cordless one
Ferrex brand Dremel knockoff
What material, how do I know it'll fit in the tool
I gotta know asap, for a rotary tool how do I find a suitable collet replacement
When you say budget, how budget is Budget
Only if I get to use the fancy crimps
"It'll just sting"

i kid, either one would be stupid quick
a whole four seconds !?! unacceptable
<@!795765716925546546>  just saw your speedboat entry, it aint pretty but damn is it fast
cya
~20m ill be able to talk
sorry ive been on mute the whole time
possibly, we'll see
we're still here
ill be on in a sec
You guys on rn?
smh my head
its on my printer
no this isnt a tv show
each is rated for 1A so 20 together should be ~20A
And with text messaging, stuff gets very ambiguous
Spicier politics than america rn
Could we change the icon to be transparent
Pm, I can't do anything in the AM
Yup
That'll be 10 40 for vez and 5 40 for the earuope gang
I can do 4 40 GMT then but it'll have to be in my room and not at a computer
Hm
Cool, that's easy to work with
i can do 10:40pm-2am gmt
what timezone are you
I can do late night my time on Saturday or Fridays
Yeah, it sucks to be those guys but there's already so many clones
daaamn, now i want one
that should be the point
And the bigger VZ might be close to e5 plus size so it shouldn't be too much change
The ender 5 I'd 235mm no? So it should natively support thag
Bro I'm just happy to be here
It's a kinematic triple z
im down
wdym?
like revo
might reduce weight
looks like a combined heater and thermistor with 100w power
My dad tested positive
Bruh, gotta get a test
would you not just add some new holes and make it overall taller and move the back belt mounts to the front (gross simplification) is there anything else
you could probably ask him for help
dunno how useful it would be but i know dutchdude has designed a printer around the after-chonker
we all know that photo was taken seconds after completion, too clean
every day a van arrives with the slogan ''voron happy farm- where printers go to frollick'' on the side and without fail vez collects a couple vorons and takes them inside never to be seen again. WHERE DO THEY GO!?!
i like what youve done with it
damn, and thats the bad room
hey guys im working on a application for a scholarship (they give me moneys ü§ë ) once i finish it would you mind going through it and critiquing. be VERY honest, this isnt a passion project so no hard feelings
very nice, but maybe it could be a new addition to theworkshop (
does it look any better now <@!276016956245540864>
i just reuploaded using a proper 1920x1080 version
to save on internet usage
its downscales the image
ah yes,, i just have 100 automade numbered ones
i thought thy were automade up to 100
that pic is good, and we can always chage it if anything gooder comes along
we can have a server banner
hey <@!795765716925546546>  is it you that has the really good photos of the vzbot
Yup, we fill it with everyone out of context
And this vote isn't definite, still up to you guys in the end
I'm saying around 15
Having a vote in <#829828766125522957>  over wether to add a quotes channel, how many votes would you say is enough
Silly people will be silly
Happy new year
New hotend
gotta be unofficial, unless diemex gets a alt
i have a friend whos happy to go be rude to people and knows just enough about printers to be infuriatingly wrong
we should get an **unofficial **ambassador whos happy to be rude to mean people
bro's just sad cause his printer is misaligned. or whatever hes using to check square is wrong. or really any other issue. the sketch is straight and so the stl is too
mmmm so lightweight a breeze could send it flying
ah cool, so ill stick with a normal heater and just keep somehting between it and the wood
Heater for a filament extruder, in the case that I leave this running while I'm out I don't want any accidents. Especially since it'll be sat in a wooden shed, so im just weighing my options
Cool, just seems like a weird concept. Can you PID tune it to 220 and have it's max temp be 240 or so
thats what theyre meant to do but it just seems sketchy to just plug it in and leave it
tired of your hotend being able to heat up, no more! our special 5W heater and 70CFM fan combination guarantees your printer will never reach a temperature above 30C

i like it, only opinion would be a finished image of hpw everything sits on the frame. otherwise its very clear
oh, i see
if you do the first hard part of making it in cad but as a large flat plate you could cut and insert it in tinkercad so the line width would be the same. either way though it doesnt matter
yeah true, if we had this one part be a stl only then it would be fine. otherwsie it doesnt work
If you made a large plate of the pattern then used a bit of tinkercad it would be pretty easy to position it and make a cut thats just big enough
if you mean the spelling im happy to look through the github every now and then and correct them but thats probably the limits of my knowledge
building is mispelt in the card above overview
hey <@!451709396280410132>  is (
iirc
235
and no one saw anything
it sens the messages to the channel i set it up in
cant
hey you mind not deleting those messages
child labour
confirmed maze has his children painting renditions of word documents so he doesnt have to buy a 2d printer
they did a oopsie, but at least it pushes klipper forward and will probably improve the average companies opinion of 3d printing and its speed
one issue
that looks pretty cool
this is fairly important
do <#859133490041454592>  and feel free to @ everyone
whered you announce that?
that sucks
oh shit
also were those bent sheet metal or also machined
hey vez did you ever decide what to do with the ten x gantrys
If I get out my childhood trike can I join
Retire and build printers forever, never having to work again
5 years from now voron has collapsed and the discord servers fight for dominance. vzbot rises above them gaining thousands of users and hundreds of serials are registered in a few days. the server continues ti grow annd the admins are slowly overwhelmed, 20 new moderators are brought on. but the bots just keep spamming. 40 new moderators are brought iun and the server finally settles down at 2 million active messagers. soon vez will announce his new company that will open soon and begin by hiring 100 of the top users. 10 years later- vez has overtaken creality and most other manufactureres, vez.co has absorbed mellow and most other aliexpress sellers. vez can now retire from the funds from vzbot
damn, at least the uk government know they'd get murdered if they had a lockdown before/during Christmas
ill put that in announcements
yay
sh let me be lazy
And im not well know for my coordination , situational awareness or balance
In a not very bike friendly area
Through very busy roads
It's a 50 minute bike ride
Good one
Hahahahahahaha
the only downside of this makerspace is that its in the middle of an industrial park with no public transport
ah neat
true, but its all far cheaper than buying outright
So I couldn't print the alu version, and when you say a few layers of reinforcement wdym
So it's probably fine
You need 7 hours paid training
Or just cnc'ing all the parts myself
I'm mostly interested in the CNC and 3d printer, assuming I can afford the training is there any benefit to using the kevlar/continuous carbon fiber filaments for the x gantry bits
A 4 and 5 axis CNC, lathes, a plasma cutter (soon), markforged 3d printer
They've got shit tons of equipment
Just visited a awesome makerspace
I thought you meant it mills stuff inside vacuum
Oh that sounds awsome
What's the vacuum part mean and what's it achieve
i cant wait for everything to be finalised so i can buy all the cnc'ed bits from you
what sound goes with it
daaaamn thats a biggun tv, i already struggle with a 27 inch
ps4 still respectable for most games anyways
lmao
are you gifting it to the kids or for yourself?
its all WIP
nah not yet
and in <#854702637224034314>  and <#834136970464329809>
both are going into announcements and getting pinned
and that guy doing a extruder comparison
the hotend comparison
me neither, would need testing. if you happen to have a magic 200w heater in your back pocket you could toss it and a 80w into the m+ and do some klipper magic
would a 2nd/3rd  heater thats ~200w (or something stupid high) that switches on for burst high speed as well as that offset be better?
it might be okay for normal speed----->solid infill----->normal speed
iirc klipper already does this with things like PA and IS
nitram had some magic goop he was trying out for better silicone socks which helps a bit
and it would have to be within a certain limit
or something that sees a spike in speed/volumetric flow and ups the temp by a certain 'offset:flow' value
Tbf you bit started talking about rearranging the Sherpa around the same time
Extruder inconsistent?
Should make for a good heatsink
I'm sure we've had this exact same conversation
Ah crap, terrible memory
And like fhesse a rotating extruder
Nice, are you doing rigid bowden
Extruder or cooler is under NDA
Why blurred out?
Hey <@265629116106145793>  are you gonna be using direct drive or bowdne
if youve got the rest of the metal bits id love to buy them with vez's blessing ofc
hell yah
<@!485803444758773760>  do you take small commisions, pretty much the full metal build that rac has
i wonde if a hotend exists that direct mounts to a mgn7 carriage
only other things that come to mind is obviously some lighter screws, whether that's alum or plastic and using ceramic bearings to reduce interia as i beleive theyre lighter
ah, i see, could always experiment with a cheap carriage, doubt it would be a hardened metal if you go cheap enough
if you wanted to go to the extremes
so you could machine it out, or skeletonize it
theres nothing in the middle of the block is there other than dust protection
and that aluminium looks awsome
that cf tube looks thiccccc on the tiny build
gotta keep the gremlins inside the steppers in line
ribbed for internet speeds?
you sure thats antenna
Cool, fair enough
Is shipping from Germany to UK alright, also do you take custom orders
Hey <@265629116106145793>  you're in the us right
hey vez, with those metal parts, id love to have a unique build so having a 1/10 part would be pretty cool, im happy to pay full price to get them plus shipping (especially if theyre lighter)
id just generally like to have one, im happy to review it if it sweetens the deal
true, how much do they weigh, shipping them may be cheaper for the receiver than buying it outright
How do they plan to do the giveaway?
at least i hope he is
i amigine hes a team of at least 2 people
<@!485803444758773760>  i was told this would help
lemme go find it
Looks symmetrical to me, just a funny angle
Which part isn't symmetrical
Is it any good for 24/30v or is it all round meh
Yup all good,.just finished clearing out the channel
mmmmm algorithm
off topic, but i found this video. thought it was pretty funny
I've also got a copy if you need
oh no, although a few freezer's compressors would have similar effect or bette
and that chews through ~500w
it was able to keep a rtx3090 at fill tilt under or close to abient
something like this would work well, no?
Assuming you got some moneyz
Wouldn't be too difficult to add
Hey <@509772297289072653>   have you considered sub ambient cooling
andy@millebot.com
gotta contact them for a product and pricing catalogue
the original printer idea is a concrete (or alike) printer
guess what
now put a 0.2mm nozzle and ascender extruder on it
happy to help
yup, and it uses ballscrews for z and i think a rack and pinion on xy
and the last update on yt was 2 years ago, they may still be open to questions tho
the mille bot is fairly old but looks pretty close to your specs, not sure about its gantry weight tho
<@!795765716925546546>  do you have a max budget?
Also what size extrusion?
What's the surrounding frame made of
What are those, motors for ants /s
Sheesh
its pretty light, possibly better than wayne daltons
other than the heatbreak, which can be cooled, the extruder is the main part
Damn, I hope it isn't too serious
Either way, I can't wait to see how the build goes
My orders always arrive with the most important part first then least important then all the fasteners I need show up a month later
Damn Lucky
2
oh bruh
just hit 2k members

sometime between now and yesterday
yeah just a tad mre than aluminum
im no specialist but tldr is crystals and shit
peek is also suuper acid resistant
and a thin copper sheet insteaqd of screws thats also boron nitride-ed into place
boron nitriede to glue it?
possibly
but light weight
yeah same here, it seems like lots of effort
ad need for a threaded heatsink or more epoxy
worst part is the epoxy
yup, cut out the heatsink entirely too
that stuff looks pretty cool
Unsarcastilty
It ends up being all my friends in VC shouting 'xi jingping greatest leader'
Or at least stem from satire but miss all the nuance
Most of the memes praise it
and theyre making fun of a person stuck under that regime
well they arent making fun of it
And very racially insensitive
Well they are 14 mostly
All my friends server
<@!265629116106145793> ^
the +100 social points meme
its a shit meme going around, definetily crossing a line doing that tho
6mm id for the mesh
alright, ill be buying those fittings probably, a heat gun, probably more heat shrink and pet mesh, anything im missing?
should also reduce PA
trying to find a nylon equiv
it will have to be on my creality machine tho so no PA just retraction tuning
yup, im in the middle of trying to find a specific adapter then ill be testing the longest length i can make
i might make a huuuuge stiff bowden to test the difference before and after
apparently massive impact to retractions
the pet mesh doesnt weigh much, i can go weight it and get a close estimate
if its the fittings specifically you can avoid using a adapter block and use a m6-> barbed fitting
which part?
also, are you using stiff bowden
whats the current setup
point em downwareds
lift offffffffffffff
someone used a wrench
or sheet mjetal glued in
i was considering steel pins
and can we post process
is aesthetics a part at all
id happily participate in that
no the chungus hotend or some shiz from the soy guy, or maybe the extrudinaire
voron made them a vendor tho
nope
is soy dude also 'iamthesoy'
are they casting those themselves or just post processing?
mb
ah i see
would it not be a socket headed screw driver (if that exists) to remove the nuts
i suppose to tighten the bolts easier
Cool, just figure if it's important to the brains üß† then I should probably also bookmark
What for?
You can build your own if you want to
Is it for slow close?
although they may have waited before announcing it to figure out the issue and correct it
probably
damn thats convincing
even without trademark
a quick search brings these 3

my energy company offers if to those whith weirdly high bills
i know some companies loan them
when you say cheap, whats the maximum amount that counts as cheap
you mean having fr4 as a backplate and inegrating a carabiner or alike to the toolhead
not feasible unless they make huge changes
ah cool
ill assume they arent adding it then
is it a fairly cheap fix if annex were to pursue it
yeah that makes sense, i might buy one for 24v on a cr10 otherwise ill stand back til you reccomend a board
or is it something that has to be baked into the board
also would a diode fix it or would that make no difference
ah cool, is the board fed by 48v or 24, if its 24 i assume the powerbrr or something else will be needed to add 48v
all the drivers are hv which is nice , i dont know if they have the anti explodi thing you mentioned tho <@!451709396280410132>
i like video, its not the best filmed but its no nonsense and is very clear. only change would be to add chapters 
well that thumbnail looks amazing
duh
oh yeah that
but like in stefans video if you do a little cleanup it worka
for the design straight from it sure
true but you can re design from the generative, just use the general shape, flatten it and straighten it out
have you tried that generative design thingy with those few mounting points itll probably make something good
so with a little uneducated guessing i think flex would be minimal
yeah probably, the ender 5 without a bed doesnt flex much and its 3mm alum
how big is the bed?
Idk probably not enough torque
brings tears to my eyes, so beatiful
you can mount the VEZ on the VzBot and use VEZACS for cooling all bought from vez.com
the Very Experimental Zoomer
<@!509772297289072653>  ive got a name, the 'ITTTOAGNFTLT' or in long 'im too tired to think of a good name for the light toolhead' . catchy eh
<:growtent:905956892268974170>
‚ò∫Ô∏è
whats it tzake to classify as an com0panee
ah cool, just confuzzled about wording
hes paying you for you to sell? or do we buy it from him without you receiving comission?
<:pog:909151185620074546>
as long as we make one of vez's design to measure exactly hhow big the spacer should be its fine
true, i still like mine the most cause its mine but yours is the most logical. only good part of mine is granularity and more CF otheriwse yours might be better
true
true but moving vezs one would give you infinite resolution for adjustments whereas the spacer would only provide large leaps at set heights for each hotend
theres no fine up/down adjustment
print head
but again i like it the most
it is the most simple way but there wouldnt be much granularity
at least it didnt crash
ebay.co.uk/itm/185155988679?hash=item2b1c282cc7:g:FEcAAOSwmCthi5JN&var=692914390541           (these arent the best but as an example) the solid rod is in a system similar to how smooth rods go on a z except the rod moves and not the bearing. the hollow rod is glued at the bottom of the solid rod and held inside a 3d printed (holder similar to thingiverse.com/thing:2105202) but with relevant mounts. then once its build you just slide the rod up or down with the fan and when its perfect ill figue out how to hold its position
and sticks out by the diameter of your tube
mine only adds a lot in vertical height as you adjust it
its glued while in the lowest position
short length of cf tubing goes in here, any ID, then a cf rod with a very similar OD slides into it and they get permanently glued togtehr (here the twist) the rod is the part that slides up through a tight 3d printed hole and it carries the rest of the carriage up
if so i got aniother idea
to glue a tube into a 3d printed hole
can we use glue?
but i only know itll work with large metal pipe, it might work with some washers and cf rod though
i got another idea
cool
does this need to be super light?
feel free to tear into it, its barely though through
this isnt for the ultralight carriage is it?
just two tabs and 4 nuts and 2 screws
grey=metal blue=locknut. you would mirror the grey plate to be on the bottom but it just allows two plates to move up or down, theres not much to it
in paint
its very porrly though out but lemme sketch it
why not a a set of long m3 screws with locknuts to move up or down from a flat plate
ah cool
cheers
just a quick question, how do we hand out the <@&894651349298475038>  role?
well you see just push the thingy between the round bits and push then tighten then you lower the doodah and push and tighten the round things like before, simples
talking about removing the rgb from a fan and i dont think my friend understands how to remove the wires
I wonder if polishing it would look even better
God damn that's a sexy carriage
Very suitable for a family dinner
Really lovely
Relatable
stop being mean or ill get my boyfriend on                        /s
hey <@!451709396280410132>  not sure if these are assumed standard but the board will have a boot led for each soc and will ave ethernet
can you not <@!323961338412138497>
and add mounting holes for a better stepper driver cooling system or a one large heatsink that attaches to every stepper
and less reasonable, ports are layed out like a pc mobo
boot leds, for both chips (those might be standard already) and ethernet port for internet connectivity
beauty
Never say never üòâ
"no no no, just ask Rac he says so"
"don't worry mom it's for my education"
"oh the 800 pounds that left my account this morning?"
I'm in, if I get one I'll probably pull the trigger on the full vzbot build
but cooldesign nontheless
true
sure, gimme one sec
Should spread heat more evenly and looks much more aesthetically pleasing
I quite like that heatsink
Have you seen the e3 v3
oo and if this is a aio board will it have ethernet/usb ports
they can always add a expansion board at a later date
damn that extruder is sexy
you assume we even have waterfountains
funny one
2 hour afterschool
wanna see an update
ah cool, i see it now
also i love it but whats the difference between simple and complex
if the text is out faciung it wont go downwards if its inlayed then yoy can print face down
also karmas a bitch
thats the entire server pretty much
sigh, so mature
yup
we are a more educational group
tbf they mostly look for social groups
BRIGHT COLOURS
MUCH FUN
GAMBLING BOT
MEMER BOT
WEED BOT
yooooo BOTS I HAVE ALL KINDS OF BOTS
dude you're like printer jesus
Always wondered why manufacturers don't utilize it more
Nice
That's a ptfe tuve right
Spacer, hollow tube with an id of the tube then a step to the od of the tube
for those who wanna join
yeah the other answer with that is 'unicorns'
i think thats vez
mostly
here you go
updating now
A word doc looks much btter
Yeah but some answer are stupid long so it doesn't look good
I'll update tonight but from yesterday the results are here  <@509772297289072653>
ilkl update tmrw
does the hardware change in this newest version or is it mostly printed parts
that literal gif is what i usua;ly follow up with
yeah like its the emoji of the word 'sus' its questionable or sketch
cause i keep using it and people just respond with a ?
ü§®  what do you guys think this means then
nah emojis barely have a standard meaning
But I always see something good and everyone's grimacing and it takes a sec for me to relaise what they mean
Dunno maybe I'm the weirdo
Bruh am I missing something or do y'all use the grimace face instead of the smiley face üò¨Vs‚ò∫Ô∏è
I'll make one
And shall I @everyane
Gottaa do the poll, should or go in announcement
Yup
Pins would protect the bearings and be omnidirectional for installation
Ah sorry then when not steel pins
Could you use a cf rod and rubber gasket with a hole similar to the cf rod diameter to hold it together
but still darken so i do think 2 or 3 is best
It'll probably darken a little once it's thicker and not on a whit backdrop
3rd from the top
pretty cool carriage
ah thought so
One question though. Are those black pipes at the bottom for beard air or just for structure purpose
Only dislike is the back looks quite desolate otherwise I like the minimal looks
Now it looks quite good
If you added a cf beam through it, it would look great
I think the render just makes it look funky
i think its meant to be ultralight
around the hex standoffs i think
hey <@!784092758187966524>, congrats on the promotion
Also a required photo of the print with calipers around the sides. To make sure the extrusion system can keep up with the motion system and to make sure its within tolerance
Yeah max is good
Sure thing. Im fine with or without layer height rule but I think its worth asking everyone else
Ah that's better
We can ask the winner (just to have pinned in the relevant channel) or any ridiculous claims (rare case of cheating) to reprint for a vid
Its only bragging rights so I doubt many cheaters
Nah I trust people to be honest
Or something like that
Time also gains them points. So if we all print ot and average out the time anything longer by 10m loses points for each 10m and everything faster gains points per 5m
Yup
Lower height and higher speed/ quality is more rewarding but bigger layer heights could get it done faster
So there should be a bit of wiggle room for settings
True but for v6 machines to be capable a lower layer height can be utilised for a higher speed, or a v6 machine of medium speed can be maxed out at 150mm/s assuming layer height and width and large enough
2 shells then and layer height below.26 inclusive
Noicr
Actaully within .2-.3
Everything else looks fine to me, for criteria is should be within .1mm deviation
Nah leave ,48 then
Isnt .46 more standard, or is it designed for .48
Forgot about that. A small support pillar should fix it right up
I like it, should be challenging with the small features
And with a short time frame people jump in with a entry and whoever wins gets a specisal role
Prove theyre the best
Same as speedboat, for the fun of it
But this is just a little booster/taster
This ones gotta be small and no proper prize, we'll do a big proper one soonish with a big big prize
Announcment can just be saying its a competition and rukles to follow
Cool, ill make the channel and announcemnt
Is the comp trhe fastest vez cube or the actual vezcube design
Seems like this is the way to go then, how do we want these to be submitted and rules and criteria gotta be drafted
Or if someones got something bette im all ears
Lets see what everyone else has to say then announce it with community post and announcments
Yup
And we can judge off aethsetic, how hard it is to print, how long it takes to print while weighing a set ampunt on set settings
Ah yeah, like a calibration cube but vez and designed as a speed stress test
No prizes and nothing too difficult with a community competition winner role
Small friendly competition time?
Nice
Ah mb
Partner != discovery
Also we are near a partner nprogram, we just need 50 people to talk per week
Depends, if we boost the sevrer (enough people own nitro and use a 'boost' on us) then yes. But yourr nitro doesnt change my upload
No problem for next time
Ah my bad
That too
Just to be clear, he doesnt have a 3d printer and spammed in other servers before
I clkeared up his messages
Was saying a lot of wrong stuff about klipper and confused some guy, then asked for admin
Did a quick ban and removed that issue
Spamming me in dm for a role/admin
Banned @peopleperson
Can i ban someone real quick
Dunno what he expected
And he claimed vez was fraudulent and falsifying claims
Lmao. It was a 4hr mute and after insulting the owner
F for soydude
Oh boy. Check botspam
That seems reasonable
Good on him
LmAo
What did lastone do?
Ah well. If he gets serious problematic ill issue a warning
Pog
Wasnt even active in the convo between soy and diemex and its already got me pissed. Fsr are used all the time, from custom printers to the ender 6
<:Angryjonny:856641574863634452>
No announcment channels
Link to odrive server?
I cant remeber how but you can follow announcment channels
I think if its from a relevant server than yes
Ill need to turn off the bot and reenable it
Actually, yes
Nope
Gimme a sec and ill upload
Ill have to make a jpg that says that
<@!451709396280410132>  you see anything in there?
Weird, i only see a sigle message from me
Can you delete it
My one message wont delete
Ah crap
Dunno why my one message broke it but ill go clean it up
Alright, its all set up, <#857156984150163488>  can only be images or vid
Thanks for getting that for me
<@!276016956245540864>  the guy closed the ticket and the reactions went away but it hasnt closed, should i ask him to just close and reopen
Oh sick. Ya ill stay admin. Thank you
Alrighty, all set up, back to mod for me
Sure thing
Cheers
Yes
<@!509772297289072653>  could you send a image file of the server icon, thanks in advance
Just for a minute, yes please
Hey <@!509772297289072653>  not sure what powers i need so if i can quickly get more perms i can add mee6  and then i can send maze the few emojis i want
Oh I have some good ones
Cool. Ill figure that out tommorow
Could we add mee6 (for its level counter) and possibly dank memer for its text game (unlikely)
Be discoverable through the public tab and we  can see analytics on users
Hes gotta do it subtly tho like a thanks to so and so from my discord server
Oh cool, do i have the perms to see those?
I may ask what they do with the parts that fail qc
Either way I think its gonna be assome seeing their lab. And potential freebies if my dad does work for them or help them out but thats no guarantee
And the co founder said my dad (lawyer) may be able to help them out with navigating the market as a new company (they mentioned the knockoffs)
True, they may not want to be the best hotend anymore, also in some cool news I may be visiting the slice engineering lab for a tour
Thats the thing. They dont have one and they need one to stay popular. If we work with them they slap our name on it and sell it to everyone and everyone benefits
I think next step forward is adding some of the discord profiles of the big makers into the server and getting some vendor channels or a sponsor channel. I also think we should go for e3d for the hot end
Anywho, I'm off, ill be back later potentially for vc but probably just text channels
And since we would design it it could be easily integrated into the design, it would also be able to focus on the few aspects we need and ignore the others
Cough, cough sponsors, try to reach out to Misumi and slice and the likes or mellow and trianglelabs and powge or local business (although that limit who can build the printer) and see if they're willing to collaborate
Similar to the VR YouTube Habie147, he went from 20 subs to 150k+ in a month or so
Its all ticktock views tbh, it built off of short and simple videos that people love scrolling through and his videos are perfect for that
I gotta say, unless I come into a miracle my budget is severely low so I won't be able to help with overall testing, I can test small bits and bobs though
Ah, he has more on ticktock, collab with him and make tons of money on sponsors or adverts
Marsgizmo right
I think you left the plural part out of the video
I think sponsors are the best way to go if you do some mild promo's, we should build an all out v2 then build the v1. 5 which try to keep the budget super low while maintaining all the functionality (corners will have to be cut)
Although you never know
I don't think we're journals reinvent the wheel, but we could build a testing platform type printer, with standard mounting and standard sized pieces and modular design, and a cube frame
Fair enough, I wonder if Cartesian but built well would be worth it or if a heavy duty leadcsrew system for a chance would be worth it
True, but nothing recent other than nitrams delta has been in the 'news'
Same here, it would be new and none of the other big servers have one, so we get some people that have delta experience and then get a good designer and make an ultimate delta
True, we could go for a delta, not many servers have one of those
We can open it up to the whole server and everyone can submit files and ideas
I just saw that a few days ago, I thought that would be pretty cool
Do I save or delete
Just asked and he can see it
Lemme ask him
Hm I got the description and media link in there so if it works then ir shoukd be a fully filled out serial
Hey I did it, first serial done playerup got serial number 2
should we make a second 'folder' of mods with <#845353557384495135>  <#845005456932864011>  and #official-mods inside
nice, the actual serial will be auto filled then, description is for any deviations worth mentioning
so 'slash register @dummy 2 england '
oh cool, i just do slash register and the bot does all the magic, thats awsome!
once vez does his can someone upload a dummy test or is it not possible/so simple a toddler would get it ( i just dont wanna mess up someones serial and leav devin cleaning up the mess)
alright, sounds good to me so i just do the slash register and a serial or slash register and a @/mention. this seems more professional than hevorts honour system so thats pretty cool
nice

Welp. Stock is no fun, although getting payed to do soe thing so simple is nice
True, but I would never get tired of the upgrading part.
Lucky bugger
but thanks for the tip
ah dang, thats outta my price range, until i can get a job i guess im stuck
did a delid
Cool, these got drop kicked by USPS so I'm not too hopeful
That's the plan. Is there a best way to test a drive and see if its soon failing
Everything else I'm using for parts
I'm just gonna see if the two 3tb drives and the 4tb drives still work
Nah these I got super cheap from a friend as a favour. Gotta be respectful and not look through the drives
Where do I ask in the annex server about then toolhead
true
damn
i get shit done and dont loose out
my friends only get home at 5 and i get home at 3:40, so i just get studying and work done until they get home and then i do sfa for a few hours
all my end of year exams are only on stuff i learnt this year and nothing from previous years
cheers, ive got it down fairly well but this covid stuff has made it pretty screwy
geography and latin are so i meet the requirements for a  american uni (open options)
geography, triple science, latin
thanks, i should be alright  but ill give you a shout if i need
ik, just based off of current circumstance that uni looks pretty dang good, but idm where i go for uni
ive got family in the area, the uni is quite nice, they are 1 mile away from slice engineerings office (great summer job)
i figured kill 2 birds with 1 stone
oh i know, i just gotta get into university of florida and doing DoE and having experience with 3d printers will just help
nah, not dev, my cad skills are dog shit, ive just been around since early beta of v0 so i answer most peoples questions on builds and design
so its relatively fast growing, nothing like the vzbot tho
weve gained 129 members in the past month
the v2 just released into beta and theres a plenty active discord, theres a unofficial bom and build instructions on par with voron (or slightly worse)
its using a voron inspired belt path and may be forked into a more standard corexy design and is still quite new so plenty of space for innovation and participation
i get 125k accel at 350mm/s on long straight travel moves and thats on the stock creality motors
its called the zero-g project
yup its kinda sad, we do some half assed walk then our parents pick us up from bumfuck no where then we get driven out at the ass crack of dawn and finish the walk
none taken but i have built my own printer and have plenty of experience in maintenance and 3d printing
yeah this year you gotta go home at night instead of in tents
yeah, i was just hoping some makerspace/printer part company would lemme volunteer there
yup, at least all my friends also have to do it properly
ah my parents want me to do it properly
northern london
Preheat?
let it dry with heat
why not, ive got spare time and if slapping some stuff in my house togteher will give me  a viable lube, why not. also some lithium grease and shredder oil made a nice thin grease that didnt run out of the bearing but glides nicely
E.g buying ptfe dust and making theyre own or using a thick grease and white spirits to thin it
Has anyone looked into making their own lubricant
Whats a good insulator to wrap my heater block in. I saw nitram using some cotton like thing

i couldnt afford a hevort so i went with a smaller less advanced design
i got the cheapest rails from aliexpress since my budget is incredibly low, i wouldnt reccomend them since they are wobbly and have awful machining, they cost me $6 for 300mm+block
what did i buy?
and the extra bearings is nice if you loose any or its missing some, same for the plastic block (makes cleaning easier)
i cant gurantee anything but ive heard this seller has some fairly good rails
but you can buy from nearly any seller and get a good rail, itas really luck of the draw, stick with what your printer design reccomends is the best advice i can give
robotdigg is very cheap and for high speed youll need to clean and relube the rails with ptfe dry lube
cool

hedset ded
was just on
Do normal games detect it? Mine works okay
not sure what to do
got to the joel interrogation scene in the last of us 1.0.4
ill link it
wen he finish mod you wanna do beatsaber or nah?
lemme finish this vid
yeh
gimme a sec
kk
yeh?
yup
Also good time as ever to experiment with higher homing speeds (mines at 55 )
Just do it in increments of 8 then 4 then 1 and its fairly quick
No problem, thank you
1.5? I heard it can do 2.7 maximum with active cooling. 1.5 seems right with no cooling what so ever tho
No problem, I did the same thing and womdered why my stepper was burning me
Quick explanation of current setting on TMC drivers. the value you put in should be the RMS value. not peak value that is written on the stepper.
The calculation of RMS from peak current is this:
Motor_Peak_Current x 0.707

Since we don't want to push the motors with 100% we'll do:
Motor_Peak_Current x 0.707 x 0.80

That will give us a 20% safety margin.
On a stock Ender 3 motor that is 0.84A peak 
0.84x0.707x0.8 = 0.47A

So you input 0.47 in run_current of your TMC stepper. 

A normal 1.4A stepper is:
1.4x0.707x0.8 = 0.79A

so you put 0.79 in run_current of your tmc stepper. 

the Hold current there is no "rule" about. i like to do Run_Current - 0.2
This will depend on the use case.
But thank you for the cfg
Not maximum sustained ampersfe
Klipper uses rms value
Nuh uh. 2 amps ia the maximum for the steppers
good luck
bye
true, but the tft was ¬£5, for a beeper you can just buy a piezobuzzer (unless you want multiple tones) although im not 100% sure how to wire it
i use the btt tft24 in lcd mode since i prefer the dimmer screen and resolution but i use the exp1 and exp2 ports since last time i used the tft port my board went pop
also read through this if you want some more speed
yeah that should make it ,much easier, i just started with a chunk or two from dutchdude and their cfg
cheers
if you got one of those would you mind sending it to me
oh yeah mines fairly barebones and only has what i need, i never figured out a macro for sensorlessw homing (they suggest a home x then a move to the middle of the bed on x then home y after waiting 2 secs)
also youll need to change the printer limits to something less stupid fast
no problem, the layout doesnt matter as long as you leave chunks intact (new paragraph=new chunk) and people usually put the tmc section next to their respective stepper
ignore the temp fans they are broken and watch out for some temp sensors using a secondary board
Nice. Well ill be available later and I can send you the cfg
If theres any part in particular I may be able to help but my best friend was fluidds error reporter thingy
Cool

Sure, I gotta get to school so I can boot up the pi after and send it over
A opaque plastic bottle over the torch?
Sofirn
Not for the price you need, but the lt1, lt1 pro or lt1s are good
Ts22 is a wider beam than the rest
They're all usb rechargeable and the ts22/ts25 or fc11 are the best option
Then amazon
Get direct from their websites
Ts25 or ts11 or ts22  or fc11 from wurkkos or sp10 pro from sofirn, get the warmest option available but they're all fairly cool lights
And use case
What's the budget

Also. Can I phone you in 15m
Either is fine
But i usually keep it pretty low
Sampling steps maybe 30 at most
Yeah a too high denoising strength will completely change the image. Denoising strength is how different the image is from the original.
If that doesn't work lmk
Img2img, low demonising strength (0.2 starting and raise until it looks how you want) the prompt should be the command word (e.g "arcane style") and a short description of the image
yup

might have dinner first tho
lemme finish setting up router tho
yeah
beatsaber?
Cta
But otherwise what I said was right?
Cool
Right, so you like the wide angle of the s21d? But charging and price is the holdup. Look at the if25a from sofirn on AliExpress (also check all the prices on AliExpress not what the review says usually it's out of date
I can't make any recommendations tho unless you read the reviews
You can get light up switches
Because the colour?
The s21d has 4 LEDs and is pure high cri throw and is nice for indoors and outdoors use. But it's range is very limited
If none jump out at you then I'll give you a recommendation but one light I'm happy with you might not be
And especially the beamshots
Read all the reviews first
It depends
Read all the reviews and let me know that you think
But you wouldn't be able to pocket them
And for pointing and hitting everything
The last two are great for pointing towards a roof and using to light large areas
First two and most reasonable. The last two and close to a can of coke sized and will have crazy lumens and runtime and peak brightness
Nothing too throwy and plenty of brightness
There's a range of wider angle lights
Which one did they have?
Sodacan or pocketable
Size?
Cool
How's AliExpress
Lemme take a look
There's 4000 lumens available for that cost
Like personally I'm looking for a long range long runtime light. Meaning I'm left with a larger size less bright light
Pick the most important ones
Lumens, runtime, charging, firmware, size, distance
Whadya want
Let's discuss torch
Good
Ah
Byr
No special exposure/iso settings
Default camera settings
Which makes beamshotd eash
In the Dominican Republic it's really humid so the flashlights have a much more visible beam
Also
Cheers
Yeah they updated the bookmarks tab and removed all my old ones
At some point I gotta see which songs you have. My library of songs got nuked
I gotta download it
That one's fun

It says exhaust in the title
I've got a ton of songs to show u

If not
If it shows up on your left after loading it worked
Ah I see
Also get mod assistant
Yup
From last year's winter championship
No it's actually really fun
Smart Song Suggest 1.5.18 (1.20-1.22)

So what is this MOD?
Song Suggest is a tool to help give you a playlist with 50 recommendations for relevant ranked songs, based on previous played ranked songs. It has options for removing suggestions on disliked songs, or keep those songs that are slightly too hard from being suggested for a shorter period. It can also generate another playlist of your 100 oldest songs under a certain accuracy, to make it easier getting your overall ranked accuracy up.

Does it actually work?  
With the new updates to filters it is quite accurate for almost everyone now. Default filter values has been set to what we found optimal for the PPv2.9 release.

Does it just feed the same few songs back to all?
The way the algorithm works, is so that most ranked songs are potentially evaluated against your top 50 songs. The results are quite individual, and is adjusted as you get new top 50 plays.

Bugfixes
UI no longer locks up when showing a low linked warning.

Dependencies
SongCore, BeatSaberPlaylistsLib, BSIPA, SongDetailsCache, BS Utils.

I'd get a mod that recommends songs for u to play to move ur rank uo
That rank isn't bad
I haven't got a rank yet since scoresaber doesn't like pirates
Nop calling it here. Unless we play my muscle memory maps ur gonna best me in a online game
Your gonna best me 100%
Usually takes a half hour or so of no breaks to finish
I just put on one new ranked song and do restart on fail
I get too sweaty and shaky after 30m
3 hours

I can't do many at all
I really gotta beatsaber

Either that means its crap mapping or really good tech. But there's not much of a difference between those two.

Cool, I got most of the way through the game before corrupting my save file trying to mod, I really enjoyed it
Sure, im in America rn so I can't play for roughly a week but then I'm free. If you need more games checkout steamrip for vr games. I'd recommend buying blade and sorcery (after trying it on steamrip)
Awesome
Only if you don't need it. Also could you look down the barrel, what's inside?

Hello
U are the worst
Bugger off
the first is a printer that might work wel for you and the basics course is a good quick start guide
watch these
Cr10
Or cr10 sized
So ender 3 sized?
How big
Bruh, gotta start on size
The smaller the printer the easier it'll be
Wouldn't recommend
Cr 10s pro
Which parts will you print
Well
Rough estimate
How big are the parts you'll print
Ender 2 is the barebones teensy tiny printer available with all the bells and whistles or just a basic version. But it's fairly similar to a ender 3 which has tons of mods available
Ender 5 plus or basic are solid beginner choices with no flashy features but a square frame allows for a lot of expansion
So a unenclosed printer is fine. A ender 5 or ender 2 will be fine
Well it depends what your printing
There's strong 'nuff or indestructible but expensive
Do you want cosmetic prints or functional strong prints
High temp or just cosmetic prints
Alright so probably creality brand
The ender 5 and 3 are solid choices but there's a lot out there. It depends if you wanna mod it or if you want a high temp printer for strong plastics or a hog speed printer or a small printer or a reliable hands off printer
Nice
Are those tactile ?

ill show you later
then use the bookmark methoid to download songs
yep, unistall normal beatsaber then sideload this and use bmbf (latest release) to mod
yeah it was always a little off on my printer. after a couple hours of trawling through klipper docs i found a formula to find a good sgthrs
just to realize i didnt have a pin
i had to do that for mine too. was not a fun time trouble shooting why it never worked
ah im using a old melzi board for 3 extra fans on my current printer, as well as the ones on the skr
It's not missing much is it? Sure it isn't hv but I'll buy a powerbrr for that
wadya know, i dont need to buy a new board when i upgrade. skr pro is pretty high up
Powerbrrr by maze or 48v injection daughter board
unless you really have to
hold off on buying from fysetc for now
or is the 46v max including a safety margin
do you not need to run the 2130 at 80% of their max rfated
Consider using the powerbrrr from maze for hv injecting
Sounds perfect
But DO NOT short the pins
If you have a wide one that touches the fets thats the mostt important
Best place is the annex server for that question but iirc its the mosfets that need the cooling but a fan should suffice
Afaik
Separate mcu
Yup
ayyy now i can use it without magic smoke
ah nice, i dont understand what half of it does but i assume it goes ontop and the top thing a capacitor in which case it looks pretty good
what is it?
Either you mean the retreat. The consultancy or just focus and do it
Internship ir apprenticeship is usually bettwr than uni (as far as I know but my word isnt gospel)
Ah cool
Pog, is that a klipper machine
Wasnt verdict just ise stepper protector pcb and wire in 35v to the 2 power in pins
just make sure you are acually supplying the right voltage to the stepstick and you're good
klipper shouldnt need to know its running a higher voltage, but im not 100% sure
Ah
What does coolstep do
Not noise trying to gain speed
In the same way you do pwm for stealthchop
No, has anyone tuned their driver for spreadcycle
HAs anyone properly tuned their drivers like pwm tuning for stealthchop

everyones can bring their hone i think
we also need the cleaning stuff
but the pasta isnt a full meal, its just so that we can say we cooked soething
and my own lunch
alright, so ive got matches, pasta for everyone and the notepad
we do
for everyone
ive got the pasta and everyone briung their lunch
yes
and bring a sponge
ive got a notepad and pasta for the group things
But I've already made up my mind
You might be right
What about reflectors
I swear it was all the edge light of the LED is focused and the centre is unfocused so it's spill
Use a LED with no centre of the die so there's no spill
That's not a normal use case
Yo nuns DM me if you maybe wanna meet up, I'm around the west of NC rn
So it's spill
This optic doesn't design out dust, so it's a side effect of the design
Spills just a side effect of optic design
Let's go at it
Functionality id argue its the same thing
True, still spill tho
It does actually have spill, barely anything but it's there

All the light on the trees in the first pic is spill
I've been through Raleigh, hope I didn't miss you

Piss light ü•∞ü•∞
The shadow of this tree on the clouds
It can run indefinitely, I just need to install a protective glass sheet
I've got another set on the way, if it's parabolic I'll make a dual beam light and if it's elliptical I'll hopefully get a light with double digits of Mcd
I was hoping for a lot more, I thought it was a elliptical reflector that j could focus through a lense but it's a parabolic so i can't focus it more
Yep üòé
250W, 9.2Mcd, 17k lumens, 6km throw
It's a Uhp bulb with a parabolic reflector
Yeah
Had low cloud cover today

hey <@136231916469878784> wanna buy a custom light
<@99626793648029696> i think
Oh the w3 is the mega wide
I swear the pro tac has the large beam for a lep
Sweet that looks nice and floody
Sc33?
All Ive heard is high performance and anduril
Was it not you and sitrel making the anduril driver
Gotta get snakes custom driver
True but it's a lot less efficient than lh351d, I wonder how different run time would be
Might try a lh351d for better CRI
In the first photo it lit up every tree visible which is at least 100m and it's not fully dark here
Might make it my edc
It's seriously bright and throwy for its size
L2s beamshots too
What current can the sst20 Dr take, might put it into my knock-off c8 and put the round die ws5050 into the real c8+
It would make a nice walking light
It's just so much floodier I don't think there's any real reason to use it in a thrower
I'm considering putting the sst20 into a s2
Sst20 dr c8+

i dont know of any pmma filaments, and PC is very expensive, but they are valid options
in that order, best to worst
PETG
PLA

has to be FDM
that isnt SLS/SLA
any filament with the word clear in it
wont get unless you ask
damn
and the cold makes it brittle
pla would melt
rather ASA no?
PETG tends to be be best for translucent
also, what country?
they can print it
4pm earliest
At least in the UK it's dark by 11 ISH at latest
Damn bruh 1am
Might invest in lps next
Almost got V2 going tho
I payed 100 for the UHP setup and it's not even Woking
Oh what 50 is cheap for something like that

Beamshots tonight
Got distracted but it's working
HEATHROW TERMINAL ONE CAR PARK/ARRIVALS SIGN
Not quite
Mmmm
Guess where this optic comes from
Just a burnt spot, everything else about it works
probably but the degradation they'd experience from the heat probably outweighs the beam quality drop
Ignore the condensation that's from isopropanol
I've got a spare xhp50 version
I'm tempted to slice all of their phosphor off and get a huge blue blaster
It's very obvious on shadows
It's a shame it had to be sliced because these LEDs had a beautiful clean white tint
There's a definite blue tinge to the beam but it's easy to ignore
Sliced off the burnt section
Could be
I've recorded some slo mo so it's easy to see
Interesting behaviour from the ns59v2, on any mode it powers on very dim and then steps up

maybe ill make a magnet attatchable diffuser thing
hes gonna use it indoors
ill send him a diffuser too
thatll be perfect for my bro
Both are waves but very different
Nah
Yeah spose so, vibrate anything enough
It's like bumping marbles together but light is both particles traveling and a fluctuation of fields (I think)
Sound is a diff type of vibration
Minorly better but it still shines a light into the camera
It beats using my eyes for sure

I'd love to get a osramber soon
True that
That's neat
The ssq is almost kinda rosy
Roughly
But the general colours do look accurate
My phone never handles mono stuff well
And same for what looks yellowy in the pic
Oh that's a amber xpe 2
Which one
Even my non flashlight enthusiast family agreed that the xhp50 had a bit of a muddy beam
The ssq60 has such a clean beam
Thatd be sick
I do want to get some gitd paint for the walls tho
Especially now that I've painted the walls white so there's no orange Corona
So it's a decent light
It doesn't kill my eyes like a culpm l21b does
But with the 3000k I've finally got a reason to grab it
I quite disliked the ts11 when I got it cause it doesn't throw enough to be a thrower and it's not wide enough to be a edc
Imma grab my ssq60 ns59 for a comparison
Of those lights, my least fav has to be the sp10, it's button is so hard to find
L-r of the wall goes: cuts10 3000k, ts11 3000k, sp10 v3 xpe amber, sc31 pro sft40 3000k, wk40 sst20 6500k, mf01x sfn43 6500k

nothing?
why dont they solder all the bond wires together

It is pretty great
ill get beamshots tonight and then advertise on reddit

The l21a?
yup
It's a l21a with a yingfeng 9090 LED and a 12v boost driver and a zwb2 filter
It's not sorry
or plaster board
oh actually is it on a section of dry wall
or a paper
definitely a detergent then id say
what colour is it
treu true
plus our house is fairly clean, the bathrooms the only interesting place ü§£
its probably just a detergent

Why's button top particularly nice?
also, reckon a normal 12v boost converter is good enough to run a gtfc40
i just need to see obove or below 2A
ill cover it with a shirt
life goes on tho
cool, just means  ill have a bright UV LED on while taking readings
a convoy 12v boost driver?
or does it need to be in the circuit
can i measure without the LED
i gotta figure out how to measure the current
uva
TMRW I'll inspect it better and see what's wrong. I think it might be the filter
Inductor should be fine
Nah it should be at 2.3A currently so I'm not gonna try push it
It should be brighter I think
Yeah I think I'm doing something wrong
So not s12
S2 UV
Nah, l21A with yung Feng LED
Though I expected more
But there's definitely a larger and far brighter hotspot to the l21a
It was hard to compare them
A S2 UV Vs the new l21a UV
The warm was soooo orange but also colour was so easy to see
Apparently the cooler tints are beautiful too

1800k gtfc40 mule
would putting a AR lense behind it help?
on a LEP tho
lodnon rip
yup
maybe with a cnc machine
itd be very tough to build
youre right tho
i imagine itd be similar to the mule spacers that people use, thermals would be good enough (probably). wiring might be tough but you could drill channels in the copper post
would a elliptical be any better than using just two lenses
but yeah
you probably knew all that üòÖ
so at the lens focal point the reflectors beam appears to be a single point
but you want it focused to the lens's focal point
i think
thats how my UHP bulb light will work
an elliptical reflector
continental US
UVC is gonna give ya cancer
If you do custom it, a active air cooled UV mule would be sick and you could probably run it off life4po which have decent batt life
Other than contacting sakowuf to make you a custom or just diy-ing it you might struggle to get more
Three
I get redirected to my ISP adult content filter page
Huh just looked to see the price and the wurkkos.com website won't load
I suppose you could also slightly mix the red and white to have a tinge of white if it helps your danger response
But in terms of what I enjoy most, warm white lights the best
It is kinda spooky
the deep red is fantastic for night time since it doesnt wreck your night vision
it does add some complexity to the UI, but youll pick it up eventually
so a night time light thats ideal to me would be a 2700K dd 519a and a deep red sst20 on a d4v2 and amber aux
theres dual channel (even 3 channel) lights that noctigon make
but its not enough to use outdoors
i use the amber AUX on my ts10 when its pitch black at night and i need to see the floor
kinda
i mean
no optic, so the LEDs shine straight out unfocused
right angle lights arent really my thing tbh, ask in <#793967775730761808> and im sure someone collects them
either 519a (dd for extra rosy-ness and slightly more throw) or e21a mule (all flood, no throw) are good bets
from hank (noctigon/emisar) the dw4
tint wise the s21d with 519a is my favourite for a balanced and high cri beam, if you want a warm or rosey beam the 519a has you covered
honestly, anduril 2 is a set and forget interface, once you configure stuff you only really need ~4 different combos for basic use
any one of those will serve you well, do you have a starter budget?
i dont pay much attention to that sorta light but iirc the jetbeam rrt01 is really good
for me thats: wurkkos ts10, ts11/ts12, fc11/fc12 ; convoy c8+, s21d, l21b ; sofirn q8+ ; noctigon d4v2, d1v2
that covers most of the basics IMO in terms of size and beam profile, tho a few of those have different options for LED
any criteria, theres some basic lights that everyone should own
much cheaper tho
the wurkkos ts11 has a similar look and has rgb AUX too
not the OP, but that pattern is from the secondary "aux LED" which are there for aesthetics mostly, they are shining through a optic called a TIR (hence the T1R's name as it uses a TIR)

I might be able to ask about it
I think my school has a spectroscope
Ohh from the blue light in pink
And how come green still shows up when it's only pink light
I tried cleaning it with alcohol
It might be my reflector tho
Pretty solid beam artifacts
How come?
I hope those are clear enough
There's 3 bond wires
Yeah I kinda want to buy a xpe now to compare

Bigass 3xd cell husky
But I definitely gotta fix the tailcap not unscrewing and flash new anduril
And it stays cooler than my ns59
And I'm loving the mf01x, it's a surprisingly useful light, on lower modes it stays cool but then I can blast the lumens in a nice smooth, concentrated beam
And in this humid air it feels like a lightsaber
It's so small and throwy
Lumintop GTA is AC so fun
So you've put aluminium tape around the head, not the surface of the tir?
He just threw the camera really high
Ohh so worse in every way

1x1mm die is tinyy
Mine don't look like that
God DAMN
yeah theres a local makerspace that i can pay to use, i just want to try modding before i invest in that makerspace for the tooling capabilities
I want to move away from buying lights and start making mods or custom stuff, even if it's more expensive it'll be more fun
Once it's winter I can be a bit more outdoors earlier at night

I think part of the issue is the ring around the switch is pretty high so that makes it harder to get a good angle. Plus rear switches are just difficult to double click
But it is doable
For me, I'd end up dropping it, so I keep to two handed use
Both, because it's a awkward ass switch that's got a lot of depth it's hard to double click
On its lowest mode I can use a more comfortable grip away from the switch
But I can use it alright with two hands
Getting to turbo is tough at best, I'd prefer a dual switch with a eswitch to control modes
Tricky

<@140540414154375168>
what country are you in?
The blue light where it's being held with a light saber was taken at 2 am with minimal light pollution but nightmode makes it look so bright
But if you've got a white light try get a shallow angle between the camera and LED
Blue light shows up the best in the air
Night mode helps a little bit
Ahh you got the camera backwards, don't have the camera in the spill generally
It'd be more useful
Yeah I was wondering more a flooder light the q8
I wonder how far away you can see a flashlight from, since you can see city lights for miles even if they don't illuminate the area
We're all torch people, can't be that awkward
Was that in a low light pollution area
Cameras never capture the full power
I wish I could be there
It looks so sick
<@428822136623333378> I got the xhp50 version (probably a mistake) and I've loved it

it is, doesnt look like theres a dome on it anyways

Wait til I get a blue z1- that might be the cheapest 0 spill + all beam light
I've got a z1 blue on the way. That should be the ultimate non LEP lightsaber
Thor 3 ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è or Thor 1 for the tiny size but less tight
Bear in mind the lightsaber effect is partly due to the Florida air being so humid (and I'm on the seafront)
Later tonight (USA) I'll try get some ground level shots
It's usable for walking but no good for range
The second set is two Thor 3 pics and two l21b culpm pics
My bad - first is a nextorch k40
ye
any tips for how to align the pocket clip
i might be missing a gasket or smthing
oh well
damn
its fully tightened üòî
id assume for a review youd have everything tightened
ahh- for photos shoud i unscrew it to have it in line
wdym hot batch?
And did you change the colour
Even better - I'm thinking I should be removing some of the brighter colours like the blue sky
Should the wood be higher up
<@612824164692262962> sorry to keep pinging you
Dang that's a nice photo
So a standing upright and a "on its side showing off the branding" angle is okay
Cool, tomorrow I'll try get a better photo with the grass
The photo isn't quite level since my mattress isn't flat
What do you think
<@612824164692262962> ignore the background, it got too dark for a outside shot
orange peel reflector
someday ill look
theres probably some good alternatives from san'an or other chinese brands
ohh thats cool
<@544931397048205312> whats pricing like for a cft90
i wonder what the pricings like for some of the super thrower components people like enderman used
dayum
browsing the store and clicking is snappy but the initial load is bad
yeah theyre reeaally slow for me too
There's 3 in each row
When you say bottom two?
Don't ask how or why but I have 300 floor tile samples
Hey <@612824164692262962> which looks best in your opinion
And overall more lumens
Vs the ns59 with all flood
A better throw channel and then flood
Damg that ns14 is looking nice
i want that second one
oh wow
thought i was missing out on 2 quid torches
thank god
so taobao is reasonable for larger orders then getting it reshipped
¬£27 vs ¬£32
thats more sensible
OH
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE
idk
perhaps its time i learn how to use taobao
ikr
do they do grouped orders- like i buy 6 lights and have them reshipped in one go
and how much is that reshipping company??
wut
dawg
the full power just doesnt show up on camera
the thing is crazy, lights up my entire street as far as my eye can see
wait $50 and i payed 100 something üò≠  got a link to that taoboa
ty, lemme get pics
also, lighter or darker wood for the base. and laminated or not
wow good or wow bad?
ahh the default camera gives you exposure, brightness and colour temp
pixel 6a
do you do this as a hobby or profession?
wowowowowowowow
if you told me you just took another photo in my backyard you couldve fooled me
thats a crazy difference
OH WOW- thats the same image???
ill brb
ill go for centered, keep it simple
yeah its much more attractive in the top one. is that just the cropping? are square images better or 16:9 landscape?
okay so

no funky debris in the background
no hard shadows from grass etc
wood looks nice
either blur background or normal angles
and indoors for less shadow
so keep it level and centered
ah okay
But with text and images
Something closer to smothered chrome
I wouldnt say I'm going for the full pro level review
And no blur
Otherwise same photo but a higher angle
Ah so I can try blur the surrounding
Considering I can't take proper measurements of any specs
More formal or less
What would make it better
Yeah
I'm trying to make a couple reviews so I can show sofirn to get free units for review etc üòéüòé
Can you guys rate the pics
ive tried, just un-focused the beam unfortunately
Not bad
Not direct hit tho
I've had a lep to the eye
or jb laser?
jl laser?
nah uits this
solid beam tho
hahaha thought that was a cloud for a second
Got a couple other good ones
Ikr
And my friend with a l21b
I'd say the image is darker than the actual life
Ns59v2
Sc31 pro
Iirc the sft40 has a buck boost driver no?
so i think its working
and my friend (whos house backs onto the park i was in) said he saw "some wanker running around with a bright light last night"
in the first pic the torch is at 45 degrees to the floor and still lights it considerably
photos dont do it justice, in brightness, spread or throw
mb sorry, its the nightwatch ns59v2 with xhp50.2 6500k
the thor 1 and 2 are smaller but similarly priced variants
yep
but the price is up rn
yup, i got mine  98 with battery from aliexpress
the things a beast
shot with my new pixel 6a
thor 3
whoooah
pixel 6a
in the air, blue light is more readily absorbed which is why its worse for throwers
So send them to ME
It'd be unfair for one of you to have both
Be reasonable
Boys
Nice
Nicd
Damn
got the idea while printing a tube for a bat signal
im addicted
made a tpu diffuser for the s21d
Room reaches 150c
2 sources
13650000 lumens ‚Äî it also says the beam is 9.129 billion candela.
what light ios that?
thought that was the great LEP meetup 2022
12lumen?
üò©
It's worth it, bought the thor 3 and don't regret a single penny
red light propagates through flesh better too
in this case i think lumens are the biggest factor, since the light is flat against your hand theres not much spread
lep doesnt even go thriough my hand, its only 400 lumen
red led would do it
The park was nearly pitch black and slightly foggy
I love it so much
Yupppp
i dont know if the larger thor2 head is annoying or even worth it compared to thor1
my onl reason to buy one of the teeny LEP is because theyd be pocketable with my wallet
i cant find a good comparison of their size and how they fit in the pocket
if i email him do you think he'll reply?
thor two 18350 size
anyone have a thor 1 or two?
Maybe when I get a job a x75
Not sure what next
EDC, flood, throw, lep
I've got one of every type of white light
Sc31 pro, s21d, Thor 3, l21b
1 has Charging but it's my only 18650 light
I only have 4 lights
Nooo
Gonna use a powerbank and some magnets to charge
Nop. No 21700 lights I have with built in chargin
Gonna rig something up with a old batter pack I have
Unfortunately the thor 3s protected 21700 doesn't fit in my charger
Thor 3 on the left
L21b culpm on the right
FIRST LEP üòçüòçüòç
I go over 3 seconds and it's mostly white blown out
How's it so dark with 15 second exposure
I might purchase that and get a slightly throwier optic on the tailswitch light but keep a floody optic on the sideswitch
Oh wait
IRL it's a much smoother beam with a very wide beam
Just not very brightly
The s21d reached the very furthest tree seen in the sc31 shot
And I was having difficulty standing still
Yeah there was a lot of bugs
L21b x2, s21d, sc31 pro +TIR
Locked settings
''fog''
does the blue one really look like that irl
how come
north london
yup how'd you know <@389869960664449036>
or same price for more throw
and i might maybe be getting a thor 3 unless theres something cheaper for more throw
hard to see but it lit up the tagets  870m and 1100m away
Identical l21b around my neighbourhood
sc31 pro beam profile
It's hard to see cuz compression but here's the l21b with culpm aimed at a 650m target (Albert gas holder) and it lit it up easily
thats 65 degree beaded tir with sst40
i thuink i like 1 the most
yeah i just wanna know everyone elses personal preference
for a edc light
type 5
type 4
type 3
type 2
type 1
can someone help me choose which tir is best looking
And if I find the need I'll get a green
I suppose I'll start with blue as it looks coolest
Alright so that's a pretty big difference
I know blue has the most solid beam
Does green throw significantly further?
Blue or green
After seeing those, I kinda want a coloured thrower
are they the same?
its not a w2 in there. its a culpm, no?
is the dl40 the half defective one?
is that the l21 i sold you or a second one?
I see, so either find coated frosted glass and a floody TIR or DC fix
Yeah I get that. It just seems sanding glass would have less losses in temr of light output
Can you purchase frosted glass lenses? Are those a thing
It's nice and rosy, smooth beam that convinced me to get a tir for the sc31 pro
Lovely size
S21d with 219B
On vs off
Smart thinking
Oh duh
How'd you know?
I sold my spare to him
Sam as sandgrain
Sure is
L21b culpm
I quite like mine. I got a culpm emitter (no clue if that's better or worse than sft40). It's comfortable in hand and doesn't get super hot
Now we have this
And went, daaaamn
Dropped torch in pool
fair enough
you can always buy a large 240mm fan and use it during pla prints to vent the enclosure
are thise pin outs all 24/12v
There might be a bit of a draft but probably not much
Fan on vs fan off should work
I would say the plastic unless agitated doesnt spread far (assuming uyou can smell where it is at all times). But a fully sealed enclosure with a custom rubber gasket at the front should be airtight assuming made currectly and then a pipe vent with a circular fan at the end can poke out a wall/window
I seal off my room then open a window and blaast the fan after a abs print
I will say that short term ive suffered no ill effects from printing in my bedroom other than having some clothes smell a little plasticy. Long term i have no clue. But this is a tricky subject for any internet person to make
Dibond doesnt weigh too much so if its held at the top oo, then probably
You could do a temp fan wich i think will turn thr fan up the further away from the target temp but it may just do what you said first
Oh im blind, could do press fit corner clips with manets but holes are easier, but yanking off a panel for maintenance is ez
Drill holes embed magnets and add clips to the acrylic and embedd magnets
Magnets?
And i get crapped on for my wiring, i suppose it works though
but imagine having a printer shining in brass
yes
just checked
and stainless steel is more costly?
ah, and oiling the panels would be icky
damn, 10 a peice thats a steel of a deal, also would actual steel not be better since (i think) its meant to be cheaper
sounds good to me, what finish are you getting on the metal panels
nah nah, thats the right thing, shoving metal between them just transfers heat into a large metal sheet wich radiates heat
sounds good to me, rockwool is really temp resistant and so is aluminum, just make sure not to thermally bridge the alum panels
and would some strong electro magnets be worth investing in and some proximity sensors or push button to enable them and hold the panel on or id that just over engineering something that isnt a problem
the magnets on my cupboard are really weak but when sandwiched between two metal pads (dunno what metal) they get a lot stronger, why is that and should i try include that in my design or just get stronger magnets
Ill be doing something similar but withupwards swinging panels
Nice
hahahahah, same, ive got 2 government developments nearby and atleast 10 home renovations
yeah its cheap enough to buy im just saying my stuff is so damn thicccccc it takes up so much room
i got mine from a skip and its 75mm thiccc
psh imagine paying for yours, cringe
no no, its 12 .50 cal shells lined up tip to tip
Dang
Is that a skr pro v1.2 inside that box
Pog
anywho i have some work to do, ill be back in a hour
skr pro v1,2
yeah so will they know to drop down to 3.3 from 26 instead of 24 down to 3,3
and 24 to 5 for bltouch and that sorts and maybe for the drivers
inside the printer theres a step down from 24 to 3.3 for the logic supply
i dont follow?
mobo chip
no no, just to make sure theres nothing blatantly stupid, e.g me wanting to add heatsinks on parts inside the psu
ok so, ill do it when i put them in their new box, and add more cooling, woulod you mind checking out my design when its finished, it will be commented and everything with each part labelled
logic supply voltage for mcu
ill assume since it says its good up to 28.5v that its smart enough
dang it, ill do it when i next disconnect my electronics then. will the voltage regulators work, are they smart enough to know to step dwon from 26 down to 3 versus 24 down to 3
i cant @ him
oh shit i think hes gone
alright i just probe a positive and negative terminal and then turn the screw until happy, do i do that with stuff connected or not connected (not my pi since that uses a step down and that will need tuning again
maybe just 26v or 25v
samee
oh cool, i guess my pro should be able to take that then
can your printer take that much power, im considering turning up to 27v and turning down duty cycle on the bed
hairspray is the best ive got
what do you guys usually run for abs without enclosure
nah, i do small parts usually and for large parts i use my cr10 wich has a massive bed and heats the part throughout the print anyways
abs i use 85c and petg 55c and pla 45c and tpu 30c
60%  percent PLA 30% percent abs and 10% percent petg/tpu
my stock bed does 85 in 3 min to 5 min. but the bed is practically made of aluminum foil
Other wise wall anchor and add weight
Tesnsioned metal wires for overkill
this channel should probably go beneath serial requests
id like to do ''@announcements  Vez3D just posted a video!''
can someone show me how to change the notification message the bot sends
If you're sure, I've been itching to try a large cht and get a obxidian 0.5 and 0.8mm brass. I don't need them all though so if you'd rather I can just pick one
Don't worry, met up with jof in London yesterday and he gave me his spare
Ah gotcha, that's alright
Hi Simon, I‚Äôd like to ask you a big favour. As part of our curriculum at school, all year 12 students are required to spend a week doing ‚Äúwork experience.‚Äù This is an unpaid week in a work setting where we‚Äôd be able to see what work is like. So far, I've reached out to several different companies, and I'm waiting on a reply, but it occurred to me that where you're working would be a killer placement, would look amazing on a CV, and would be exactly the kind of thing I‚Äôm interested in. So, I wanted to reach out and ask if you'd be up for allowing me to do a work experience week with you. Ideally, it‚Äôd be done during the month of February ‚Äì and I can be flexible on dates. I would have no trouble coming to California to do it and can make all the necessary arrangements, I‚Äôd just need to know if you‚Äôd be amenable. Please let me know. Thank you very much.
i really cant thank you enough for the oppurtunity
hey simon, thank you so much for this weekend! i had a absolute blast (hopefully youll be there next year and we can have a beer together üòÖ ). you wouldve been proud of our booth - we had jay's build **flying**
Yeah just something short, they said closer to December they'd like to call just to check in
Ah gotcha
Hey vez, I was telling my parents about that project opportunity and about the fair in December. They're looking you up just because and can't find you on LinkedIn, just to put them at ease could I get a link
ty üôè
ive messaged mellow and told him to ship it with fast shipping and once i wake up ill pay for it, hopefuully itll be sent tonight/tomorrow - if you could just send him a message letting him know to ship it asap and ill pay him once im awake (so it may ship before i pay)
no no, its just wasteful of  money and the frame
I'll cancel that order and refund
Oh gosh, I completely forgot I can ask mellow for  just the extrusions and for speedy shipping
Thank you so much for all the help, I really appreciate it. I've just ordered the frame with the faster shipping (it only adds 5 GBP to the price)
I can't find the frame on 3do but they probably ship faster
Either one would be great, it's up to you
Ugh
I'm gonna have to get expedited shipping with mellow
It doesn't fit üò≠
I don't know how you juggle all the work you do, I picked up a job and it feels like I have no time anymore
Thank you so much
I'll try that tomorrow after work üôè
Huh alright, the 5mm hole is easy to do
Does the screw head fit within the channel?
Alright, I'll take a look tomorrow, just for reference, how exactly did you do it with a drill
Maybe I've got the wrong technique, mine ends up slipping a lot
The 10mm slips into the channel and ends up biting into too much metal
Hey vez, km having issues, I don't have a drill press so I can't make the 10mm holes, is there any chance I can get mellow to send the extrusions with expedited shipping
Oh wait it doesn't need tapping does it, the 2040 is tapped
Thank you, other than clamping it down and using the punch, is there anything else to keep in mind
hi vez, just purchased the tools, the total was 11.97 üôè
ive picked up a job too to pay it off üòé . the pays not much but its honest work
üôè  thank you so much! im so so so excited to get into the build
my paypals ben@benweinberger.com üòé
mb, bank transfer or paypal, im happy with either
üôè  thank you so much
it arrived today and ive just been sitting staring at the gantry. its just so elegant and sleek looking in-person
AHH THANK YOU
honestly, im beaming rn im so excited. it arrives just in time for my exams so im gonna have to wait til june 21st to crack it open
thank you so much, it really means a whole lot more than ill be able to write out
8167408535234189
yeahh didnt want to miss out. the last round i missed the shipment
maybe they do retroactive discounts ü§∑
small issue, saw only one left and panicked
Hey Vez, are there any discount codes I can use before I purchase the printer kit? and does your affiliate link work for the kit? I'd also like to say THANK YOU for offering to help with paying. obviously you cant just pay for someone elses printer and i dont want this to sound like im pressuring you to pay a lot, i just wanted to check how much youd like to chip in
just consider some people try sell prompts for AI images
i think your right tho, its certainly not selfish wanting to give out everything you work on for free
no no sorry, resisting the urge to make a sex joke
no problem üòÑ
üëã
no, i understand. theres no deadlines or strict time schedules and its best to get the vid out than delay it or rush it
alright, well update me if you know, otherwise it is what is
up to you if you want to do that or not
looks like to make a event for new videos im gonna need an exact time, which means creating premieres
cool, ill title it about the new mainsail beta, do you know if you can share links for it before its uploaded
cheers. whats the title (roughly)
you're too kind. thank you so much
my paypal adress should be matthew@matthewweinberger.com  but im not too sure
np
all done
cool
contributor gives #development perms and admin gives both
ah nah, its under roles. which role do you want to give him
lol
Ah cool, what was the question tho?
üëã
i do my best
cool, thanks for the promotion, ill do my best
thank you, do we have any rule set or is it a personal judgement type thing
those tubes look awsome
i guess ill wait a little longer before building my printer then
Mgn1 on 5mm cf
Well they both have to be mounted and neither can have a hotend directly attached
also a hextrudort is gonna be lighter and was deigned to work on a machine similar to this one only isue is whether the belt path will work
well, i would choose hextrudort since its all in one and requires less fasteners, but sherpa offers more modularity and allows for more mounting options. plus the sherpa can be mounted on nearly any carriage whereas a hextrudort is only gonna gonna work if you own all the needed parts (e.g hotend)
ill do it with u tmrw
*not mine but posted here for cleanliness credit is to <@!451709396280410132>
I took my interview after double GCSE exam and I really needed a shit and they still hired me
Yeah you'll get hired pretty easily icl, the bar isn't too high, what centre did you apply at
I got asked if I'm a confident swimmer, and prior experience with working/customers. Icl just lie a bit about any questions you can't easily answer, like if they ask about experience with enforcing rules with customers just make it up
Idk any places near you but I know Southgate is hiring I think
430 til 10
Yeah it's what imma do
Yeah I applied mid GCSE and got.hired within the day
But once the school year starts they apparently hire a lot of people
Applying now will be tough
You can try, just make sure you tell them how long until you have a qualification
And my other manager always jokes if he doesn't open outlook then the emails won't hurt him
Yeah I heard my manager shit talking some guy who applied in person üíÄ
But emails will prolly get ignored, apply through their online portals
Most leisure centre groups have a website you can use to apply places
At least near me
There's ones coming up soon
Google the nplq iql level 2 lifeguard course
Don't sweat it
u done anything for it?
happy birthday man
i gottta get woodstain
Ah DW about it, how is the 3d printer coming along anyways?
Hey when's your birthday?
Thank you, it means a lot
nah, just the adapter
i cant find a reader i like for the microsd card adapters, could i get mine back
Unmute babe I didn't mean it
Also look into flashing new firmware for the printer
Just save whatever's on there
I've upgraded you to a SD card and adppater
Sure can,
also tune the printer first
try starting on a smaller project first
rip
which bit
I did but got banned for a Deez nuts joke
be back soon
in another vc
Might require a little bit of post processinf
Not bad
All but the heater, it might be to print but not safely
How come you weren't at school today
Cool
Also I found the part that's missing from your printer so we're all good to fix it
Hey, bring with the raspi tomorrow if you can, and would you happen to have a buck converter, if not it's fine. Also my mum can pick it up. She said she'll drive me to school and meet you at the drive in entrance, just walk over dropoff the printer and she'll leave it in my room
alr
oof
F
thats not the pissbowl is it
wait
pog
what didi do
danny?
why
I've got a couple spare drivers and boar lying around
That's all fine
Cool
By how much
Cool, I can fix that
Alright that's doable. Is the leadscrew broken
Okay
And does the power supply fan turn on or any fan turn on
Or move
Or at least spin
And do all the motors, axis move freely
Is it bent
From the back  look for a really large screw
Sorry
In 1.5hr I can tho
At Barnardo's volunteering
Cant
Nice, send photos from front back and sides
closes tonight at 12
cool
which is the z axis but its 20 quid for a replacement on there
really any issues on the printer but one
bruh the parts u win will fix the mainboard or the frame
can u enter this giveaway
Ask him to write down everything that's broken
But it's possible that more of it's broken than saavable
Without a photo I can't help
Hm
cool, id reccomend just browsing through 
Zoom
how come you joined vzbot?
unbmoot
hell nah
perms
gib
now
Feet
fine
fine
gimme 1 hour
also whats my status say

Lemme get on in a sec
brawlhalla or nah?
matthew
who are you
25(first letter of name)(last name)@jcoss.barnet.sch.uk
and youll probably want to learn a couple shortcuts on aduril as itll help you set the lights for use on the bike and then switch to something easier for normal hand held use
but yeah tldr, two ts22 is gonna be great
if you want power, the q8 pro is what you want. its definitely large but its the cheapest way to get a LOT of light (excluding some super obscure brands)
two ts22 will be brighter overall than one sp36
thatd be pretty sick üòÖ
its mostly a set it once and dont touch it again kinda thing. this firmware is also generally regarded as the most "ergonomic" of UIs' if that makes sense
at a lower level, you can program a few shortcuts, set custom light levels, use adjustable max and minimum light levels etc
the ts22 on the other hand has: a constant current driver which is more efficient than the other light, a slimmer profile, a very efficent LED, the same programable firmware, a magnetic tailcap which is handy and a SS bezel which is scratch resistant
multiple cells in parallel so a larger overall capacity, high CRI LEDs which isnt 100% necessary but is a nice feature, 4 LEDs so a wide beam and hotspot, anduril fimware which is feature packed and very cutomisable
yup
otherwise its pretty standard for a flashlight
kinda, the reflector has a rectangular shape so theres less light shining into the sky and directly at your feet and more going towards the floor ahead of you
another setup i see recommended is the lumintop b01 as a dedicated bike light and then mounting a 
how long do you ride for usually?
this light makes a solid choice for a handhelp + bike mounted light IMO, if you want a dedicated bike light then 
have a look at these graphs, ignore the uncooled graph and the ones labelled "after thermal calibration"
when the linked light is fully charged? or how long would a different light with a single cell last?
so i think, depending on how long you ride for, a multi battery setup would be wisest
since the light will be cooled with a lot of moving air youre gonna get a higher sustained brightness but also shorter battery life than if it wasnt cooled
alr, so its definitely jacket pocket size but it has all the features id want in a light

Also, when you say waterproof is that for submersion or rain. And do you mind how large the light is
Cool, that's perfect, I have a couple in mind. Can I get back to you after school?
Haha alrighty, give me a rough price bracket
Also, wide beam or long range, or in between
Dedicated bike mount or one that's a good flashlight too
Oh crap, its alright if you arent bothered just hmu if you get round to it and I can buy it but its up to you
Roughly what time (how long from now) do you wanna list it on eBay for me to buy
Oh nice, a relatively good one
Fair enough
What brand is this?
Alright so eBay just incase (for the extra buyer protection it offers) and if I had asked for 15 would you have said yes (final price is 20 regardless)
thank you
possibly, ill get back to you on that
ive got to head to sleep, so if we go on vc or just via text yuo make the listing and then i purchase and we're all sorted
nice, if you make a listing on ebay and tell me as you do it i can buy it immediately, ebay for security also i dont have any m2.5 screws if you have any would you mind shipping them with, if not i can just buy a few
royal mail
whats the hotend weigh roughly
london
what size screws are used for mounting? also how about 20 +tax/shipping/ebay fees
nice, so im all set to use it
and this does use standard v6 style heater/thermistor cartridges, right?
so how much would you sell it for, and how would you sell it to me
looks good to me
See ya
Link the git of the version you want an dill print it out and add it to the box
Yes, you can choose a bowden module and any extruder or not install a extruder module
i can print them out, wich toolhead and what parts of it
Out rn (got notification that print finished) ill respond once I get back
Sorry for the huge delay but I'm going to box it up today and ship tommorow
Alls done
nice, ill order it and get the peice done
best replacemnt with good shipping is a fr4 plate, but it will leave a matte but smooth finish vs a textured finish. is that alright with you or should i set up my other printer to get this peice done
build plate took a dump on me
hey, bad news
should get it done before wednesday but idk
sorry man ive been doing some revision for some exams
alright, lemme check BOM
ah, where it says m3 x [insert number} the insert number part is the height
what height
possibly, ive got a large assortment, whats the dimensions, ill send some practice ones and the actual ones you need
cool ill toss them in
endstops, motor pulleys, extruder motor, fans stuff like that, i can toss them in free if im not using them
ben@benweinberger.com
any preffered shipping company and did you need any spares/[arts with it
lemme go get the address
alright, well i gotta get the final quote done which means doing one last print so no payment just yet
would you paw half up front then i ship and you get the second half
i have one reprint to do then i can package it up and shi it tmrw
good news
alright
but a very barebones version
yeh im using a afterburner
Cool just got the stepper mounts to do then we are golden
Yeah
Are there any spares you need or endstops you want
Alright wrapping up the printing and about to package up assuming norhing goes wrong
fair enough, good with me
im happy with paypal, i was going to suggest ebay for the buyer protection you get
time that i have to interact and maintain ~5-8 bucks and wear and tear unless something happens that damages the printer should be ~1
a had a failed bed and the parts from there feel sturdy AF and look pretty good so quality shant be a problem
according to slicer we're talking just over 6-8 bucks but ill weigh it when its done
that way i dont get stiffed, also are there any final items you want to add to be printed
enclosure is built and functional, its very ghetto and only holds a temp of 33 degrees but the pritns look pretty good from what i can see so we are well on the way to making a deal, can we split the price into raw material + time and wear and everything else, you pay material before shipping and after you pay the rest
Ive got the bottom, top and 3 sides insulated with a 4th against a wardrobe, electeonics are inside too so I'm gonna have to keep enclosure temps in the low 30-40 at maximum
You'll be glad to know, the enclosure is nearly done, my panels were a wee bit to small so some cardboard and tape is holding it together but I'm getting the firmware ready to add a thernistor to check it works properly, then I'm doing a test print thatd designed to warp then ill be using a hairdryer to heat it and finally point a desk fan at it to check for leeks
Alrighty, ill keep on it then
Just lmk if that works before I get printing
90 to 105 for the bed
Ive got the parts ready and I'm just figuring out a quote now, the enclosure gets built today so well on track to have it done
Slap some cardboard on them walls and use a hairdryer to start heating
Thats enclosed, right?
Nice, should be a good build
It also looks gooder
At any screw terminal, its safer than bare wires
They'll stop the tinned wires from breaking and sparking and melting
100 percent
Should be good, are you using ferrules
Anything special with the electronics?
Sounds good, the parts will be done fairly soon
although i have exam week in 2 weeks so if i miss the dealine it will be 3 or so weeks max, hows the sourcing going
in the next week or so i should finish my rudimentary enclosure with temp sensors, so assuming all goes well it will be shipped on the next sunday
heres plate 2 with identical settings
yeah and thats on a barely tuned machine, this merc1 is gonna be much better
top speed of 80 but theres a key detailing speeds, it will be in a heated enclosure and to get it nice and toasty ill have a port for a hairdryer
the v0 (very first version of the printer) 30k minimum accel and top 44k accel
heres the first plate, filament cost is whack but other than that its fairly accurate
hahahha i know that all too well
ah good, just a suggestion if you were less skilled in CAD
try a plate that goes under one of the vroller screws with another hole to clamp the belts
and toolhead is just the thingy the printer whips around
could you link the current setup yu have around the hotend
alright ill add those for free since ive already got the aligners and the endstop is teeny tiny, will youi need a toolhead with it or just the corexy motion system bits
are you using sensorless homing and do you need the aligners
I should be thanking you, in getting commissioned
Not quite yet sorry, had to do some work I'm getting it done now
Just check out the afterburner for belt placement or any voron compatible toolhead
Ill go get an estimate and send it to you later
Nice (keep in mind the belt path is now corexy and holds 4 belt ends instead of 2)
For merc1 parts or for afterburner
Well ill need to slice it to estimate but it should be fairly budget considering this isnt commercial and filament is cheap
Yup in london
1.8 are quiter and run faster usually and .9 have higher resoltuion and double the microstepping (kinda)
i would ask someone who knows more than me on that subject
could just solder in a cap and smoothen the power
I just poke it at stuff, iirc most wont break if you just make sure the leads are in the right hole
Even ive got a cheap multimeter, hobbyking sells a mean 7 quid incl. Shipping multimeter from turnigy
Try a delfector for the heat
It has space to connect to the power in/out pins and a 63V capacitpr
It goes under a high voltage stepstick and supplys a high voltage up to 50V iirc but 48 is the standard
If i get a zero it only has one usb so unless i feel like sautering im better off getting a newer one. Also would the pi 1 work (its roughly equivalent of a zero)
So my case is magnetc all over, so i guess ill get a 3b or other pi/small pc with ethernet
Its magnetic or ferrous
Nice, the prinjter itself is also very slow
Also not aure to what extent but would a sheet metal box completely block me from connecting to the pi via wifi
Would a zero wh work for klipper, if not ill just get a pi 2
I suppose a even number (2) should cover most printer types that i know of
More boards
No never mind just answered
Ah well, nvm. But couldnt you make the board bigger
Or on corexy, 2 motion 1 extruder 1 z and awd 4 x, x, y, y
Delats need 3 for moving gantry +1 for extruder
4 maybe
Oh yeah thats just a last ditch way to do it
Potentially, the far right and far left could be used and you just dont use the second to the left slot
Updated versions got it i think
Oh phew, now i know
Fairs
Damn, got mine for 0.50 GBP with a identical pinout/layout to the official one
5 bucks, unless you're in Canada or Australia (can't remember which is the one where it's hard to source parts) that's very expensive
But you should be fine
You might lose torque of you go too low
Yep. Just set the current to a value safe for your driver
Octopud>spider
8
Afaik its more like 47-63.4 million
At least it looks flat
Next to your mosfets is there not a green light
nvm, different mount than i though
depending on how the din rails are mounted, asuming theyre on the front.closest side of the 2020 coukd you mount them on the back +spacers for even more depth with the loss of some z height
How often, i had a wite keyboard for years and it stayed very clean
I hear using a abs slurry majkes it bigger
How'd he do it
Wow a humongues skr v1.4
But how many outputs
Daang
That is what she said
Or a wireless hose
Ah my bad. Its like wireless seatbelts
You need to have half the cables to manage them. If I just unplug everything and remove the wires then sure its 'clean' but ya knoe
But yeah the wiring is looking üëå
Mmmm
Ill show you clean mister. Just you wait
If youre sure
Ah nice
Go for a 3A or more
Mines set to 5.1 iirc
So assuming max powa
I just wanna keep well within my max power
So 150 is overkill and I could also run the pi off it
Lrs. So I should be well within spec
8x24 then for 192. So I assune my z and e wont use peak current and k wont run full power so 150W should be a-ok
Cool
Its a good thing I know what u and I mean or I would look silly
Assumimg 2a peak on 24v for all steppers. What's the max wattage likely needed
Nice, is it still awsome seeing massive generators and thousands of terabytes of storage or does it become commonplace
Your family. Or company and which company lets you do all of the above
The total storage ive used is roughly 2tb and I rarely delete files. Who on earth needs that much soace
Holy sh*t
in terms of terabytes how much is one pd
What's pd mean
/s
Are you sure thats beefy enough. Looks to me like it can take 5v 2A peak. Maybe on a good day
Mine is zip ties
Mmm
Oh daaamm. Teeasons like what. A day or two in local county jail /s
Nda? Never heard of it
Proper cable management
Oldham and for my enclosure
Oh and my magnets arrived
F, ive got a few bags of them left
Suure
Damn, no more rats nest
Uh oh
Bottom
Aslong as the pins dont connect to the b oard you should be good
Hehe
So stay closer to that
But most stepsticks do 28 max
29.5V maximum stay closer to 28
If you havent its fairly easy
Dang. Coulda done the vzboard for the vzbot
So. Cheap rgb leds, can I control colour from the board and do power from a power brici
I can say low inductance means theres less back emf at high speed tho
Depends on torque and a lot of things, i couldnt say without teszting
Are those the ratrig re4ccomended ones
Well the wantai 811 wich are very low inductance are 1.8 so i would say 1.4 is pretty good
Nice. Ill do that when I klipperize my cr10
Is it to enable uart. My cr10 has the 2208s
How does it differ from the stock config
Mine does the same at 100. Any faster or slower its perfect. Not much you can do about it as far as I've seen
and ive decided to build a ton of these panels (assuming my friend can make iit to the dump with me) so ill be getting the 20m set
so just to check before i purchase, the magnets are gonna be cheaper in uerope (cant find a seller, have any reccomendations?) and the led strips are a okay to use
yeah ive never had anything happen , apart from one time when water dripped off the table and got my trouser wet and i banged my knee, seriously though i usually just follow every precaution i can (just dont look at my printer)
oh i know, far ahead of any of my knowledge, just saying its a cool video and fairly interesting for the less advanced
alright smarty pants, watch the video though. its fairly cool to watch a toaster toast underwater and it shows the importance of having gfci or equivalent (afaik its a standard thing in britain to have it in every outlet)
thats a lot right, so thats good, scary but good
cya
im gonna try mount it beneathy my monitor or else ill run out of sasce
alright well ill tske a look around and find a good headset/setup
built in mic or nah
nice
also something that sounds clear or does well in a cinematic setting would be great, noise cancellation is nice but my house is fairly quiet. a swappable wire is awsome since it would mean i can use them on my vr headset with a shorter/custom cable
i have no clue when it comes to headphones and usually buy the cheapest option but i want something nice for once
also are these any good 
forgot to say, preferably sub 100
so something in ear or over head is good
theyve been dying for a while now and whenever i grounded myself they would start shocking me periodically and sounded crunchy
so,  my headphones finally put themselves out of their misery and i need some new ones
Didnt see thT
Ah Thanks
how do i kow the voltage and required amps for these LEDS
Sounds right, what I'm saying is just the very basics
The buck converter just supports up to 2.5A being drawn through it
So the spec sheet should say
So assuming you run it at the right voltage it will draw a set amount of amps
Isnt that voltd and resistance in the fan
But volts are just shoved through the circuit wether ot likes ot or not
Amps is like pulling on a rope. You pull it through the system
Huh
Just check the back of the fan for its spec
Fans usually draw less than 1a unless you get a beastly fan
fair enough, i spent 5 bucks on mine since i got it from my school soooo
well this is also a buck converter but with a voltage readout and variable output
how come?
true but for a Pi or other electronics boards you may aswell gte a higher powered one
is it okay if theyre aliexpress links
sure thing
i can send you links to all theses if you need
also reccomend getting a ferule crimper and set, or a crimper for those plugs wich i dont have a link for but you can plug any vwires in any port that way
ive got no clue either, i just got the cheapest one (5 +shipping)
and for connections, if you arent using them, the bed/hotend ones are fine or the ones labelled layer fan although i havent tried those so ymmv
i can send you the link but if not you can get  a buck converter with a voltage readout
hobby king sells a fairly good 5 buck multimeter
rouhly where are you located
slap a buck converter on there or run it on 24v and a max power of 0.7 and live with some premature wear
Sometimes
Psh I can solder
Welp there it is
But no problem if you dont feel comfortable helping me open it
So no warranties
Its a old psu its been sitring in a shed for a couple of years
Lemme send a vid of it
So I just gotta push at one half until it clicks and keep doing that until it pops off
Ill probably make a screw on mount for it
This is gonna be fun
Yes
Yanked off the only label on here and nothing
Any clue how to open a power brick with no visible screws
Huzzah
I found even more glass
5160 have beeefy mosfets so can drive biggee motors or 2 motors at once
Assuming the pins at the short side extend downwards
Then you are good to go
The functionality was there but a physical connection wasnt
My drivers didnt have this pin so I soldered in a new one
If those drivers are 2209 and you want se senseless homing then your gonna need a physical pin coming out the driver
If those are 2208 then itd all good, if theyre 2209 you would need to solder on a new pin
If they are mks I dont see why not, the mixing is a ok aslong as the firmware knows
Well with hobbyist 3d pens/printers becoming more mainstream some university or group will decide to do a test. I don't think it will be as deadly as the aforementioned oil refinery but I don't think it will be nothing either (then again it could end up like cell phones and people thinking 5g is evil).
Lol I dont understand a word they're saying. I just wanna know if imma die (or something less serious)
Nice, then its all good
Can you see any thing on the channel
Just did your serial
Cheers
To complete your serial I need a location of the printer, country or city or really anything is good
Usually sky sports has it or the official YouTube channel streams it afaik
Ooh. Uh the football thing?
Alright, I might still have the boxes sitting somewhere, but it might be cheaper to put in one big box
I completely understand, sorry I missed your last message. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you as well as the filament
Just warning they wont look all too great. They are just standins
His quality is outstanding, I would stick to his options, im happy to keep these parts as backup or ship them to you as a placeholder if your parts have arrived
Finished the merc parts except one top motor mount and starting the eva next
petg eva and some purple abs standard gantry parts, quality is good 'nuff
Nah nah, ill pay shipping, im happy to include any bits or bobs you need with the package, really sorry about this, if you would like the spares as a stopgap to get going on the build until the other guy gets it done im happy to ship that too
Hey ive got bad news, the printer isnt cooperating, ive got some spare merc parts and i can send thos eover for the meantime. But its just not going great, i can print you a temporary petg toolhead but nothings gonna look all to great. Im really sorry about all this
Which parts
Thanks man, 2 means i can run a nozzle probe and a bed height probe and i can make a auto z offset sensor
Damn that was quick. Thanks for the update
And kyledavis
Ange
Rudra
Theres a early acces channel with a few people using it. Lemme ask
Will have to use some stl provided by the discord
Ah that i do not know, ask in general in the zero g server
Ah its usally just one, i would ask in the server
Top and bottom?
Nice, ill get slicing soon
Since the adxl is only on during tuning you can make a plate that goes onto the nozzle that holds it
Yupper. Lighter and more midular carriage system
Alright if you wanna update thr thingie I can slice it up and add it to the queue
Ask dutchdide abt compatibility. He was working on a mount a few weeks ago
Alright, im fairly certain ive got the right magnets on order so you nab the switch and ill send the magnets
And ive got some magnets on order if theyre the right size ill just ship them over
Best cwitch for repeatability
Omron D2F-5
Ah the quickdraw uses a clicky probve like the endstops and some magnets
I wanted to tell ya it was in early alpha but nda and all that but you could still use the probe if you custom design but if your able to return it i would ask about annex engineering wuickdraw probe compatibility
Eva is a more modular carriage if you want to use it, and the new gantry is gonna be less filament but looks kinda weird imo
Both
But you may get less torque so try it out and upgrade later i would say
Well you can set current yourself so you can run super whopper at any current
Nice. High torque are best for speed
High torque or super whopper
Well thats actually not too bad, theres some new ldo ones custom for ratrig, ask @maze for the link, he's go it somewhere
True that. Much more fun to learn what's needed and pick and choose features/parts
Hehe, and the descent begins
Ill start a print of a merc calibration cube and send some photos of it
Ive gotten the print tuned veery well
Ah good, Also recommend picking up a adxl345 if you dont have already. Anywho I'm off to bed
Do you have a backup printer? If not I would recommend getting some brackets for that frame (go for steel over alum but if alum is cheaper then may as well use it) if yoy still have a printer print out some brackets
Lmao
Ah cool, you could always toss these motors onto the stock printer to tune in current and just see how they go
Im gonna start on everything but the motion parts as theres some *interesting* things arriving, so just incase
I beleive so, or at least cleaning them up
Sorry i missed your message, im not 100% sure, but ill go check in a sec, is there any particular order you would like me to print in (since the minimized gantry parts using 1/2 the plastic arrive soon) are shall i just jump right in
It just gives you more travel on the x and y, i currently can cover most of my 240 bed but im on a older bulky version
No no, time wise im all good. But if you want to try get some more bang for your buck in terms of filament then theres some new lightweight parts in the works or i can print the etxra travel variant or just default. If you go lightweight i will leave it and the afterburner til last incase they release soon
Hey so im privvy to a bit more info. If you want more millage for the filament (smaller motion parts) then it may be worth waiting. Ill get started on everything that isn't soon to update and when they release (if its beforw I finish the printing) just let me knowif you went them
Thank you, last order they just named the parts and i had to find them. Thank you for all the help
Cool
No problem, just to clarify its just everything in that drive and i just print them out according to colour
I would ask around the main server for anything mains
Nah, stock z, i had to keep in a low budget so i stayed on stock parts as much as possible
Theres a mod that increases travel but the area im getting is around 250, definetly above stock
Ah cool, ill get started on printing within the week then
Theres no eta since releases are done around feedback
I do know and im not meant to say but if youre looking for a lightweight toolhead that is more modular this is the way to go, the release just doesnt have a set date
Alright, your current combo is compatible with most toolheads, there is a new merc1 release in the works and if you want to wait you could use a different toolhead if you dislike the ab and are just settl;ing for it
Alright, quick question, do you want the afterburner or would you prefer a different toolhead
Nice
Ah nice, i reccomend a cheap aoi pc or a sff pc and long cable
Ah with hdmi you can use klipperscreen github.com/teeminus/NoTouchScreenFirmware if you have a tft with the ribbon you gotta use this. Thank you for the offer though
If it accepts HDMI I may as well toss it on the printer and reuse the pc but otherwise its alright, rather sell it off and reuse the money
Ah no worries, I don't mind helping out
No I have a pc next to the printer with fluidd always on
Btt touch screen/tft?
Iirc 4020
In terms of where you could do the normal slap it on the toolhead or if on the afterburner use its little nook. Or like the annex hot something or other probe use magnets for a tool-change-esque probe
Alright wich toolhead did we decide on again. The hardest part should be getting it in and tuning it. Otherwise the config is easy peasy
Cheers
I can recommend searching through the zero g discord (use the search bar and enter key word 'probe'), would you mind if it waits for morning- I have to get a early night
Ah, out of my depth. I usually use manual mesh
Well theres a few options, nozzle probe, voron style button, same as stock z, microswitch probe
Phew! Guess james and hannah are going to be a little confused when their gift arrives
Sure thing, out at Sainsbury so once I get back I can send you a photot
Ive received two notes, one addresed to me and the secnd from a nicole m addressed to a james
Good news, filament has arrived and i can start tuning it right away, bad news- is there a nicole m in your houshold
But yes that was me
Ah, shared computer
Ah nice, and to arrive by tommorow
House number 6 ibsley way, en4 9ey
I would ask in the official server, i didnt install a cable chain to my printer
#6 en4 9ey
All looks good, the belts and idlers match, just two notes, those wantais can be got for 6 bucks cheaper and i would reccomend buying one or two nicer trianglelabs copper/hardened steel nozzles over the brass nozzle kit
Awsome, ill download now
Also quick note, the gates belt from tl iirc are 2gt wich is slightly different from gt2 so try get 2gt pulleys (for motors)
Nice, any designs in mind
Just requested access (different email for google)
Yes, just received it, thank you for attaching .stl, if i print all these and have left over filament do you have any bits and bobs you want printed in ABS
If you want to buy the filament then ill leave the purchase up to you, i can ask for some recommendations but colour and brand are your choice
Sorry for the radio silence caught a nasty bug and all good now, in terms of payment I was thinking of two things. 1) I buy filament you pay for what's used plus time and all that or 2) you buy thr filament and uave it shipped to me I print until the spools are empty then ship the parts to you plus a small fee (probably under 10)
Alright ill get my printers to it
Ive just done my end of year exams for year nine, I had: Latin, maths, history and science exams
Alrighty, update the email and I can get to work. My new build plate is taking its time so are there any parts you wouldn't mind having a different finish on for the bottom
Exams went good enough, I don't mind either setup, although integrated may look cleaner, I would recommend watching some serial requests and checking out different setups
Hi Roderick, this week was exam week so ill be starting progress on your parts any day. Havent checked my email recently, did you send the list
Ben@benweinberger.com
dunno if its direct drive tho
somone reccomended this
you too
you can buy from POWGE on aliexpress, theyre meant to be good
no problem, ive dealt with worse.
i can check about the orbitor
any of those sounds good to me, ill check the cost, when you send the part list just list a colour for it (accent or main ) and which is accent and which is main
well my current roll of ABS has run out so im about to buy some new ones, which colour set were you hoping for
ah so if you want a full colour scheme its gonna cost more
dont mind at all, i may need a new roll of ABS though, so if you had to haveone set of parts one colour and the others another, what would those be
alright, whenever you send over the list ill slice up the parts and send over a quote, this sounds like its gonna be quite the build
cool, just lmk whatever you decide and i can print it all, i can tune the printer a bit more and send you a couple sample pics and you can tell me if its good enough
and finally, would you like the sherpa to be printed or are you gonna get a 
oh and spare parts, if you just say what you would want to get i can say if i have them
if you want the eva printed in abs i can slice up whichever parts you want
ask dutchdude about EVA compatability on the mercerury one
resolution wise theres a reccomended set of setting so plan on using that
I know the orbiter can work on afterburner
So if you wanna do direct drive you may need to find a different extruder or a nod for afterburner
Thats the one but it may not work with a afterburner
Sherpa is a great extruder but of you have a afterburner then the direct drive on there should suffice
yup
trianglelabs too, a copper or hardened steel one is great and for backups i get the cheapest multi pack off amazon with brass
you would have to make a custom endstop bracket
i dont know that brand or their quality but i can recommend trianglelabs and their v2
ah then may aswell grab a second ehile your at it
usually you just get one hotend, if you want to try a nf and hf then get a hf and a nf heatbreak
ive nearly finished one set of parts and will get to yours soon, the hotends though- why 2
well 24v is nearlyu double 16-17 is more reasonable
then yuo should be fine although that noctua may have to swapped out but i doubt it
well if you mostly print pla you may need a larger fan to cool the heatsink other wise its a wonderful hotend fake or not, if you get a fake i reccomend a nozzle from trianglelabs
well if you can afford a mosquito i would go for it (or the magnum+)
and a volcano block is compatable with a microswiss if you want really high flow
well iirc someone is adapting the microswiss direct drive to do corexy
what do you currently have
dragon is alright, little lower volumetric flow (how much plastic can be dumped out the nozzle)
aliexpress is great for cheap items and if your getting a hotend i reccomend trianglelabs or a nf crazy if you can get one
the stock ones should work assuming youve got those
Wantai 42BYGHW811 these are the reccomended wantais
if you need the endstops i have some spare too
ive got some spare idlers if you would like those and for pins use whatevers cheap and sand down the pin with a drill if its too big and bearings theres a couple aliexpress stores reccomended
ill send you the quote asap
make sure the axis are identical steppers, the extruder can be the stock stepper or any old stepper
not the cheap stuff
oh then that grease is good
well a good high speed grease is the dry ptfe from wd40 and for a ep2 euro car parts has a good 5 buck tin that lasts forever and a bit of oil makes it a good thin grease
well well well, those are the second fastest steppers tested so far so you're all set up for speed and will you be using dry ptfe or grease
ah just removed my config for that, recently changed to the skr pro
ah nice, wantai or the e3d high torque steppers will be great then if you plan on doing high speed later
which board are you gonna run and are you looking for speed on the printer
ifyou are getting new steppers then piets mod iirc might be a good choice
and abviosuly price changes depending on which you choose (increase/decrease in time or weight will be a deciding factor in price)
if you want something high quality i can print slower but it will be more expensive, ill send you a couple sample photos of normal and slow speed and you can choose either, the parts are fairly sturdy- i havent been able to break them. and as the standard saying goes you can choose 2 of fast, strong and pretty
london
cost will be a mix of wear (less than a quid) time (maybe 2-3 quid) weight of the final parts (tbd) so the price should be fairly cheap
we can do it straight through paypal or for buyer protection i can list it on ebay for you to buy
cool, not too far then, shipping should be fairly promt, ill start slicing the bits as fast as possible, how would you like to pay
yeah fb isnt too reliable, and im happy to help, roughly wich part of the country are you in. the eva is more modular
i personally would ask for everyones opinions especially since i used a 2.2 toolhead wich iirc isnt the one used on merc1
well my afterburner is the bar minum version and im not missing out on anything although i strongly reccomend using a EVA carriage (compatability is being worked on, ask rudra how its going), theres nothing wrong with a AB its just a bit chomky
alright so a full fat afterburner in a bowden config with the boden top module or will you use the bowden coupler on the hotend and a cable chain mount (you will need to purchase the cable chain) nad endstop mounts
and the mgn12h afterburner mounts with the cooling ducts and all
so you will be needing the mercury parts (endstops or sensorless homing) and will you want a cable chain mount
so which parts will you be needing
dunno  what you mean, seems like a obvious ender 3 clone- clearly a cash grab
mmmm degloved
Too much what?
Wdym
If the quality was bettee I would suggest gearing up for super high speed and acell
I see the appeal of a standard and easy to modify mounting system but if you decide on a printed panel and stick to it its not too bad and 2020 mounts are equally as good imo they just require a larger bottom cavity
Complaint spring something or other, i remember seeing something similar in voron designs or maybe Hevort designs
but feel free to join
nothing serious
nah we're just hanging
Ah may aswell buy them then
If youre in London or nearby I can ship you 4 of the right magnets otherwise buying is cheaper
Need 6x3mm magnets
Here you go
Alrighry
It has a plo8n compatible holder and you just need to figure out the dock
Huh. If it was inverted I would say reverse the pin. But it seems like your probe is wonky. I'm not too experienced with the plo8n probe tho so ymmv. If you replace it I can reccomend the quickdraw probe
Hn. Does anyrhing happen when you cover the sensor or does nothing happen at all
And yuove got the cap or diode in
Yup
Sure thing
You could mention that and if I'm not mistaken theres a cnc. And with dd on holiday I suppose a vote between all admins. Unless I'm wrong and hes just not online
I'm fairly certain the groundwork for a 4wd mod is in place
Fair enough
Also why limit my conversations to a few select countries when I could talk to everyone
So this way ik what's going on
Sometimes the zerog server falls into dutch or German or another language
It autotranslates certain servers
Lmao. At least Google translate works well
So I get asking for me to not look but I only said I could look to warn them
And just a fyi theres nothing other than merc1 dev channels and some alpha stuff
No ban tho. It would be very stupid to ban over
Yeah like I can see a full server. Oh no. Most othet servers (I had to peak) had no hidden channel and keep a separate developer server. Although voron is fairly cryptic
He got upset and yada yada here we are
Told maze that this kind of 'hack' exists to warn him to keep naming vague
I got some discord plugin that lets me see hidden servers and use Google translate and speelcheck and a few other visual things (and nitro emotes without nitro)

I got one of those to support my monitor
But will it have bright colours and sounds
I am average middle age man, clearly. Ouchie back pains and nostalgia (no offense and big /s)
Shhh dont tell them that
Ewww cultist thrash, im building a nice mendel and running marlin 1.0 to get back to my roots
Does it run klipper
Did you say k3, has it released? /s
I got the wrong wires on the wrong pins and heard a bang and some smoke and a small flame on the back
I plugged a tft in wrong and it went pop and started burning
Same, but it was my fault
Ah just a joke, devolopment takes a while
Yup, no enterning values just reflash and calibrate
You gotta flash stock marlin then run a test then flash the skew calibrated marlin then configure again
Most splitters arent smart or anything, they just split the wires
Yes but you configure it pre flashing
You would need a splitter board, marlin afaik doesnt do that
Oh yeah, fporgot about that, may aswell slap it on there and watch it chug away
I wouldt build it differently for marlin use cause then it would be a pain to upgrade to klipper, but i dont see why you couldnt do it
Easiest way to disprove this is have a intricate object behind the toolhead thats interacted with, that way you hand looks sped up or you have to do tons of rotoscoping and greenscreeining
<a:banned:852615477196881941>
Huh?
Do you mind if I send it via discord?
Roughly how much are you looking for and would you mind shipping it  would you mind  would you mind, also are you selling individual bits or full set only
Awesome, thank you for the update, I guess I missed the email. It'll arrive with plenty of time üòä
Okay, please update me if the timeline changes
oh i see, the website at the time only showed shipping to my uk address to cost 30, so i figured USA only, its to late to switch i presume? just let me know if the delivery wont make it on time with the current shipping and ill see if i can afford overnight shipping
<@566829828112908291> how come?
I'm in london, so kinda far, but much closer than America. 2hr drive
So if they'll be out in 2 days, is the shipping going to be fast enough, if not, how much would it cost to get overnight shipping
Yeah he leaves around noon on sunday
I understand if this situation is out of your control, just do your best

Many thanks, matthew
And is there any way to get it sooner. Stupidly I decided to ship it to the US (I live in the UK) my dad's visiting for this weekend and unfortunately I cocked up the delivery date, so it may not arrive in time. Is there a way to get it fast tracked. Or if it'll be ready by Thursday what's the cost of overnight shipping
Update on 11093-22

<@!186469468745105408>
have you tried the 'spdium' mod, boosts my 3 to 15
I get 2fps
And dig straight holes
Nah go to 12
I just want insight lol
Oh it was at launch iirc
10k right
I got admin there, its a shame its only for community servers though
Are those for all servers (wanna see how it is on the vzbot server and a few others)
Ah, discord has that built in or is it a bot?
Whens that from
True but everyone has their preferences so user level is better
48v capable version of tmc5160
possibly, not sure what your issue would be exactly but has this worked before without the hextrudort
unless its an aio
not the heater, the thermistor
dunk the tip in boiling water, should read 100c +-2
They also sell them individually not as a lgx üòÑ
but the micro sherpa saves 5g
the lgx and lgc light uise the large gears
thats the only other annex that i know of
nop, theres the ascender extruder
those are both extruders
hm?
the white is cast pom iirc but its just a usual bmg gear
and you could make it solid
sharper 'image'
it qould probably bite better
np, if you go to annex and the speedboat discussion channel and search for my user and the phrase bowden youll probbaly find a few other bits abput it
yup, lowers PA by a ton
then at the end its a special fitting (ask nitram) with steel wire mod to make it self locking
its a PET mesh surrounded by heatshrink which makes it very rigid
Consider a reinforced Bowden like nutram
Biggest isue I know of is the drive shaft being flexible and springy means you need a higher PA number
That's remote direct drive right
do you mean a square sheet metal tube thing
Yup
Yup, and a Birdy told me it's a big change from previous extruders
Didn't see that the first time I looked
Ohh it's the one on the bottom right
and if you really wanna torment yourself the omnia drop v2 dropped recently
yeah fairly similar, biggest difference is the orbital gearbox
QR and bulldog are the only 2 i can think of
And now I can hold you to your word
Holy balls that's a lot
please, make a review on it once it finishes
possibly, i havent compared pricing
yup
triangle labs = seller   dragon = mosquito style heatblock+heatsink designed by phaetus
Well, if it's working, don't fiddle with it
You mind @me if you get it working
Assuming everything firmware and build wise is correct it sounds like a printed part is funky. But I'm not sure
Perhaps the frame is bowing
So not those, they could do with a little brush, only other thing I can think of is turning of the printer and manually pushing and pulling filament trough and see if it's smooth
Teeth look well cut and all the same length
Yep
Gotta look at the teeth
Could you get one with no flash, completely side on with no angle
Cheers
Can you get a pic of the gears from a side profile
On the flat
I assume the set screw is all the way in
Everything seems right
And what current set for the motor
But the gears?
And can you do more than 5 without any filament
Does any of it get warm
Same withoutntube?
Loosen gears a bit perhaps
Ah cool, they have mills? (3d printers for fast prototyping i assume)
Who'd you work for
Nice
Still internal
Ill find a link
Ascender
Sherpa mini/sherpa heavy
I said i would need to take it home, at minimum they said hell nah
They offered to let me fix it during lunch and break in exchange i get to print on it (or take some filament to remelt and make filament with using  a filament etruder)
Yep
Unfortanutely hey never stopped buying filament and have over 100 kilos
The bed was covered in it
Or when the rails got hard to move they added more and more oil
They had adhesion problems and just kept adding glue
And they laser engraved the bed
The only good they did was add leds and make custom engraved sidepanels with led from the bottom
They heard about drilling out the nozzle, it all went downhill from there
Like how the fuck
The hotend on ours had wood duste INSIDE
The cantilever bed is just oof
The frame is a pain to take apart
The extruder is half gone so i printed a new arm for it
My school one sits next to a wood lathe and is so fucked beyond repair
Its eensy weensy. Looks pretty nice too
Ah nice, just toss that in then
I bet the lgx gears with a hextrudort/sherpa heavy would get it done, more grip but with a well tested and trusted design (also no clue how lgx does at speed)
Perhaps the sherpa heavy is worth getting, especially since the servos can carry its weight
25 and no spares (plus shipping to Florida)

Maze got a serial for his laser eye surgery machine
*cough*......torture..........*cough*
well what do i print, more projects that make 3d printing cheaper
they ask why are you building a filament maker, i say it so i can print more parts
my friends keep asking why i want another printer, all i can say is so i can print mods faster
other than printer mods, no
and my cable managment is definitly best
id say mines definitely best
no yours are pretty good
no where near PIF quality
not great
honestly, ive seen his prints
true, maybe ina  month or so he can ctahc up on the project. also not sure if he has a merc yet

ah 1 after the other
or put 1 on positive and one on negative
to connect in parralel do i split the wire
ill look for a 47 ohm resistor
best i can do is 12ohm. so 1000Ma
alright i need a 10 ohm resistor i think
so when its at 100% itll be maxed at 1500ma and then the lowest i can set it will be as low as possible without flickering
cheers, you guys are the best, now ive got to figure out which thermal pad is best and finally i can get this LED running
Which is .75x1500 milli amps and 6 volts
I'll add a biggie heatsink but I'll run it at 3/4 max brightness
I'd like to control brightness and this LED gets HAWT so to stay within rated Ma and voltage do I just need a resistor on the positive out and then a buck converter
ive only got one xhp
its a xhp50 LED up to 1500ma at 12v
so a resistor+ buck conv
electrically sorry, how do limit voltage and Ma to it
<@173827530929733632>  how'd you add that LED to your printer

i swear i remeber seeing him before, did he get kicked
isnt <@259511266328969227> already a member
Huh
It is
Nice. I'll be using a pirate version until I can get back to school and get a education model but it should be mostly the same
Hey my PC should arrive during the next week, and I've finally decided to get into CAD. If you guys are gonna be on do you mind if I drop in if I need help with learning the ropes
Oh sick
oh nice, what resolution. also do you play any games on it?
which headset do you have?
but its really bad for children when they are still developing motor skills
the quest 2 is really resilient, you can run it through a tmble dryer and it will work
peggle looks pretty good
also vr, but DO NOT let your kids into vr til they're ~13
the slimes are like large coloured blobs
and slime rancher is a game where you play as a slime rancher named beatrix where you explore a larger map, travers terrain and level up your farm to get more money
both are cartoonish games. bloons is a tower defence 2d game where you place monkeys to pop baloons
e.g bloons td6, slime rancher (and hopefully its sequel)
lol i prefer much more relaxed games
tbf the ajority of the game is just large colourful beanz getting murdered
but, i dont have any homework. so life is looking up yah know
but it wont work
im tryna get a amogus emoji
allback to normal
ah good
BRUH MY EMOGI DIASPEARED FROM MY NAME
Re pins it
/s
looks good to me
mhm, thats what all the 'wallpaper engine' addicts say
lmao
look at his profile
unrelated
ah so thats what the cooling was for
what are you meantr to be building with it
ah i see, gotta use it for a proper application
could build one of the constelation series by @ikirin
lol
thats got the highest step rate of all mcu
is it a rp2040?
ah cool, thank you
you're in uni right? if you dont mind me asking, which one do you go to
once its made
if you dont put it in general at least send it to me, i love questionares
dont question the omniscience of the <@!451709396280410132>
eva fan duct?
chiiill
setting up beatsaber mods
helping a friend first
will do soon
watcha guys doing in vc today?
sick
its the 3rd link if you google ender 5 corexy
we're just cool like that üòé
oh for sureboth servers are quite similar ours just doesnt have a large public front
üòâ
i wonder where we got that idea
we're over 1k but i forgot the other requirments
what dont we have
darn
<@!451709396280410132>  are we elligible for discovery?
watcha guys doing in vc <@!173827530929733632> ?
Lucky
Also
Is that out yet or is it still pre release
some nitro scam
same in vzbot, had to ban and delte the messages
lol, has it always been like that or did they add the image after you sent yours
get well soon bud
and we're one away from 1k#
50
bruh so close
Is that it being powered off and falling
Pog
I was 8 back then. So that's quite some while
And they've been making printers since 2015
When was the voron group or printer made
And they've been around for absolute ages
And 27% of amnex
Looks like we've got 4.6% the users of voron and considering they're probably the best know diy hobbyist printer. That pretty good
although it i suppose its his 'empire' or idea that started it
ooopsie
/s
i AM server owner anyways, so i would probably know if he was in here
never heard of him
dont give them ideas
example: my printer
ive technically got a serial
<@500079262460674059>  congrats man. Went from some tinkering to a full blown team of devs with world wide participants and official kits designed around your printer
is it from someone promoting us or just word of mouth and our awsomesauce designers
could buy something, just depends on a few things
depending on when we make it i could potentially get something to giveaway but it really depends on when so dont bank on it
SMH my head
Oh sick
What for?
But a 9mm version just makes it even better for high speed
Yeah it's gonna stress it and snap it
I couldn't tell with the frame around it, best I could think was a very overcomplicated hole punch
Mb, it's a laser cutter, those don't need strong frames necessarily
Will the frame/plastic need stiffening if it's gonna mill anything other than wood/plastic or should it be fine at slower feeds
CNC or tool changer?
Also saw a box labeled mosquito for creality, so unless I missed a announcement that's a upcoming partnership
They have a test bench with marlin, klipper and duet in one rack and they had a ton of knockoffs lying around
And I got some alum desicant + metal container and a cool t-shirt
The only gripe about the design was the e5 z but it's reccomended to mod that anyways
And I was telling them about ir
They had seen it a few times
Yup
And stock/shipping area and test benches
Including their printers
Plus a tour of their offices
And gave me some freebies
<@173827530929733632>  guess who already knew about the zero g
About to go to Gainesville to see slice engineering
But not by much
Uh oh, vz bot over took us
His budget is 3k üôÉ
Yup, i warned them about that and reccomended a cr-30 plus u0pgrades
Nice, im back for this week then gone for the next 2
Funnily enough i met another dude who's saving for a cr10 max size (roughly) sla printer
Yeh english is weird, some stuff is considered feminime or masculine but only colloquially the actual language has no gender
And using nuetral pronouns is less hassle
English doesnt have any gendered words
Nah just didnt know which gender
Nice, that was quick
Congrats
Theyre adorable
Awww
Hey im back, did i miss anything important
Poggers
Thanks man. If for some reason ite urgent just @ me
Hey ill be on holiday for the next week. I might respond to a message or two but ill mostly be away
<@!173827530929733632>
cya
<@!173827530929733632>  vez just beat your speed cube
dang nab it, i thought this was for minecraft
no used cloths etc
im happy to have one but it has to stay applicable to 3d printers/ general tools
Yikes
Just gonna Screen cap that. For later..
Poggera
yup, but i dont think they were bad when they were originally sorced
also its at the bottom nearest the motor so maybe heat made the metal brittle
also if its slightly bent it would oscilate forward and backward and snap maybe
from a lulzbot so maybe just old mediocre motors getting rekt
tuens out, cant use pc, so ill be vr'ing. ill leave a stream open while afk for a bit
sorry change of plan, gota do family stuffs
sure, ill be starting on my water cooling design. so everyone gets to watch that trainwreck. i gotta make dinner so 25min from now i can hop on
At this point its just flexing
Okay okay
i only accept dogecoin though
good deal
in terms of income, i have no income
1000 take it or leave it, 2 delta's included
special deal
alright aklright
pro version 800 plus 4 linrails
starting price 300
but you pay 100% upfront no refunds
sure thing
*uh  oh*
The beltd have the proper branding i think, the bearings are proven good and i assume by extension the rails are too
Looks good to me, are dowels with it too?
This is the way
I contacted btt support and got feck all in response
Yo, time to buy a spider a burn it
Yep, max out accel then get speed as high as possible with that maxed out accel
I can reccomend orienting all the infill in the longest single line direction as possible
No can do right now, online school
Jk
At all
For no reason
But ya know, just felt like saying that
*just thought i'd mention i have plenty spare time and a need for more linear rails*
Where?
<:picardfacepalm:674708959315230809>
<@173827530929733632>. Dunno if you knew but theres a text BOM creator in fusion 360
Pog
With you
Starting
I have fucked up my mic
Found hedfones yet <@!451709396280410132>
Speech wise or object wise
Im going to conneticut and its in the middle of nowhere but next to a lake so yeh
Its not too shabby, depends where you go tho
And summer camp
Im off to amercia
Nice, im only here for 2 weeks of holdiay but im not complaining
GOOD OR BAD
Pog
Sure but might be vr'ing again
If I'm included in free from now and for 3 more hrs
You should add a disclaimer about that tho but say its no extra cost to you
Nice
Hows it going
<@!173827530929733632>  just popping in before bed to see whats going on
Boiling water, after freezing
Glass transition, just to get it soft enough to lever off
Have you tried baby powder on thhe bed and if its currently stuck just heat above gt and yank
Might be cool for recycling
Sure thing, gimme 10m
Bloons td6 and binging this guys vids 
<@!188043401562685450>  congrats, ya win
I spoke too soon
Frog gantry
Lol
Its 1-1
<@!188043401562685450>  f in the chat
<@!173827530929733632>
Lololol, i live in greater london so its pretty chill here
Yep
Yep
Guess whaaat
<@!188043401562685450>
Ah shucks mister old person. That's just false
Nice to meet your philepa
Did you say your name was Roberta
Maybe PayPal has it
Also I can't find a receipt for my skr so ill try but I doubt ill get money back
But sure
Not George
Aight
Robotdig had mgn5s too
Yuo can bend those by hand
NICE
MGN9?
Lunch time here
How do you word it without sounding needy
Ah so mine just dying should be easy to get a replacement for
Not sure if mines from the official store tho
Maybe i should take a little longer to respond then and `ass kissery`
Maybe ill ask about my skr v1.4 then
I dont usually bother talking to support
Damn, what for
Also what kind of stuff
Perhaps my hammer should meet my printer
Uh oh
Nuh uh
Unless you type dates like english people
bEt YoU cOuLdNt GuEsS mInE
Of this month
Thanks
Nah im 14, 2 months til 15
Lies
When mine huh
Today?
Hah looser, im nearly 15
Hmm
Ahem
'watch your language' they say. 'im banning you' they say
`Guess FUCKING WHAT`
*ahem*
Holy sh*t. We can get a board perfectly tailored to the recommended electronics or it could be sold in a kit that follows maze's or dutchdudes electronics setup since theyre pretty clean
I'd say its going well
My friends dropped 2 1080p 120hz refresh rate panels and a gpu
Im dissecting pcs on vc
All on your lonesome
Lucky
What did you do
nah nah nah, im testing extensively off board and ill be keeping a fire exstinguisher handy
i hope to win 2-43 spools of pla from a competition
my smoke machine is going well, i figured out vapes need airflow and i am either an idiot or i just cant remeber how circuits work.  my led panel is working well and im gonna connect it to the printer i just gotta make sure the control voltage is the same. i got more vaporisers so im gonna connect them to make a mega smoke machine
thank you
i just respired
yes
wdym?, what can i see?
looks like spam to me ''- DutchDude#2833: 22'' might have to issue a ban huh
what about first to join
nice, shows who has the oldest acc
but hows performance, ive seen yt claiming tons of gains but i cant remeber seeing any data
serious /s
its a good thing our mod team is very proffesional and
ya know
nice
i DuNnO, dId I
Teehee
Pesant
Aghem
Any performance gain in gaming/cad fps
Benchmark wise is it any better
Wehy
Oh nice, is it any good
Unfortanute dutchdude
Awww
Bruhhh
Why am i the guinea pig
Its better than a members metric
Total members not including bots
I'm happy to move to a different server to ask but regardless of people watcher ive been looking for one
I assume refering to me. I would have asked anyways, i didnt want to use their email that would just clog up support and ive been looking for a cheap discounted hotend for a while regardless of its functionality
Cool
What should I say <@188043401562685450>
Sure
Surprisingly its fairly active
But none of that would be forced through the nozzle
I assume 40 is pushing in not pulling out (filament that is)
Extruder velocity thats pretty good right
Not sure but he was talking about new gearing and it on bowden so im gonnaguess 17
Graph
Git talks
<@!451709396280410132>  this explains it a bit more i think
Where numerator is the max you plan to hit and denominator is max your machine can do

So I should have 0.02 smooth time I think - motor maxes out around 40/2000
I think its tune to your tolerance for underextrusion, if you dont care about 10% underextrusion, tune to that. If you care about 1% underextrusion tune until its that
Heres more explanation from him
Yeah pretty much. I found it by checking when retraction becomes unreliable.

The theory here is that you'll be jumping (on pa) from steady zer advance (travel) to advance offset increasing at rate ok advance*e_accel (instantaneous change of velocity)

And you want to smooth enough that this velocity change takes place gradually without exceeding max axel
Thats a question i asked and dalias confirmed it all
Quick recap. Using dalias' code you do  max_e_velocity/max_e_accel and thats the smooth time. This gets better prints at high speeds (as shown so far but ymmv at higher speed)

And will  max_e_velocity/max_e_accel work on normal PA. Max accel is found by running at low speed and stepping up accel then step up speed until you reach a max
heres a recap on tuning, do this on retract he said but verify the speeds work on extrudes too
Ill link, gimme a sec
If it works well for you guys without problem (officiaial machines) then it might be worth reccomending
And the new method to tune pa smooth time
Also have you seen dalias' updated PA
Lol, link?
Right if anyone asks ill just say i was messing around in cad and got to naming the file and gave up
Yeah
But
Tbf it was iin public live
Oh shit
Ah, have fun
Smh
Hurts a lot
ABS TIME, i hear huffing the fumes
Laser cutter?
Cnc?
Sounds like yes
Can i guess
What is it
Bruh kEeP uP tHaT aTtItUdE aNd Im GoNnA hAvE tO dEmOtE yOu
Wait. Your the engineer, wouldn't you know what your designing. Although dutchdude may have some other ideas not yet in action
Mellow is awsome. Especially since theyre the bearings we spec
But. Where'd you get the capacitor
I suppose you could run it like an ascender extruder and use really small nozzles and very little retract but you would be better off with an ascender
Heatsink in zero g shape and heat block in a 'brrr' shape?
Well if you ever find a dragon/nd crazy/magnum that has visual damage please @me and lmk how much it will be
Would you ever sell them heavily discounted or is it too much effort to bother and more economical to recycle
I assume a few parts from the assembly line will fail qc and just wantes to know what happens to them
Hey quick question. What happens to parts that dont pass qc. Are they sold somewhere discounted or just recycled/scrapped
Perhaps something like nitrams block (with his permission)
sorry to ping üòÖ

Have a nice day üôÇ
I use google
consider washing with ipa
might need taking off and cleaning
Rtitan maybe, pla (I've got some inside a drafty enclosure that does abs fine) or petg
First?
hehe saw that right as it came out
My nightmare
Spare parts
*Oh no*
Not a good one
Its a sulution
Ah well
Maybe
Maybe try cross threading it
Ive also cross threaded a leadscrew nut
Ive seen resin nutz
That was laser cut
Guess ill flip mine then
80% sure it is too
Yup
Just the stock e5 z axis plus this
Yup. 
Magnets finally arrived. Timr to make my Oldham coupler. And ive got 100 of them
Ah, duh
How?
Nice, looks solid
Yeah, everything is in parallel to the main input tho
or is it a different issue
im running a mellow super 5 board
ive got "Unable to read tmc uart 'stepper_x' register IFCNT"
the drivers are powered, status light is on
https://mellow.klipper.cn/#/board/fly_super5/wiring:~:text=UART%20mode.,the%20configuration%20file.
jumpers are correct
are my drivers broken
server inv?
Yeah I'm definitely gonna build one of those lil dudes
this helped with my stringing
sorry i didnt reply, had to go to a lesson, 
<@279835859723747328> the creality hotend fix might help out here, also make sure youve hot tightened everything in the hotend (let it stay at temp for ~15m)
very nice, howd you get it to fit
ah oops
might need a adapter
the stock board doesnt natively support the pt1000 iirc
do you have the correct thermistor selected?
needs a linear rail
the EVA printed toolhead is already compatible with the ender 3 iirc
fan ducts might wanna change to asa in the future cause it might melt
youll probable be okay with petg tbh
the other youll print
ones metal
alu and eva print head?
and nothing is physically getting caught. id just leave it and then rejig it later if it causes problems
but you arent gonna be at the axis limit too often
your ptfe tube might be pulling or a cable might be pulling
tbh, its probably fine
does that catch
looks like somethings catching
like a ziptie or alike
are you sure its not something catching it
wires look plenty slack
do you have a ender 3? do the wires look tight?
you're gonna have to get a photo
like the x gantry is leaning?
it should spin with the motor but not independent of the motor
tighten them screws
no it shouldnt slide out]
the leadscrew
<@716343060543438930> when you say rod, do you mean the threaded thingy
Huh?
That whole thing looks siiick
Howd you make the cf plates
then you have conversations going on that get archived quickly that keep the server pretty
thats true, id vote for slow mode , BUT people are only slowed on how many **threads **they can make  messaging within a thread is completely unlimited
maybe not pruning
or alike
thats what phishy is for, mutes any spam iirc. but once the server grows we can just do monthly pruning
Fingers crossed ü§û
I commented as soon as I saw the video with a invite to the server and a quick explanation
i keep that for a snack between drilling
darn
so youre saying when i just sprayed the empty bottle it didnt do anything
afaik nope
which is a shame
yeah uk doesnt do that
and ive never been one for nice looking electrnics but i decided to do a fancy case
sorry pet bot as in the plastic (PET), it turns bottles into filament
A pet bot I designed
Hopefully it goes well
It'll be my first delve into wood
It'll have a hinged section (angled front panel) RGB LED hidden somewhere and on the glass panel I'll have all the components labeled with a dry erase pen
And needed some photos for a display
Because I got tired of waiting for the wood to arrive
I made a proof of concept electronics case
I rarely adjust and don't get many issues
Tbh it's not terrible, I've the same printer as vision overload and can agree
Or try something like the vslot roller wings vez has/had
You can add a second and connect it via belt if you don't want to add a motor as well
and the vzbot is probably one of the simple/more reliable ways with just 1 motor and 4 rods and 2 leadscrews
the trendy people are messing around with linear rails and kinematic beds e.g ratrig (i think)
fine to ask here
but madbulls probably closer
i was gonna suggest too low wattage for both at the same time
if you heat the hotend alone does it reset
"Don't worry officer, it's stock"
at least it pushes adoption in the diy circles
External electronics suck tho
It was a beta unit though
They've got a video of one printing a speedboat and I think one of assembly but I can't remember
if only i could have this printers with a weekly purchase cycle
its already out of sdtock
true
and not slow by any means
pretty nifty
that is a lot faster, although its clear whos is better quality extrusion
with what looks like a not super optimised design
and thats 24v
ikr
mb
new speedboat entry is insanely fast
damn if people left u alone witrh that i may as welll start saving on gas and carrying my bombs on the under ground too
it probably wont damage it
Do you have a lathe?
add 
ah i know what its missing
then again im no pro
and maybe but a lgx on it
maybe convert to a corexy but sideways
maybe needs some metal parts
idk
looks a little slow, have you tried tuning e steps
either capacitive or inductive i think
the one onm the riught, the blue plastic block
That looks pretty cool. I like the see through bed
Some say the mystical rattle printer creates a worrisome rattling to let its owners know it's suffering and wants to be put down
Ty a repeatability test
they werent
alas
thinking i had the belts ziptied in
when i dropped my x
i have
so smexy
oh aluminum
that too
yeah
ohh is it just a lower hanging nozzle with a raised gantry
'The Essentium HSE 280i HT 3D Printing Platform is the first industrial 3D printer that offers true IDEX. Other IDEX machines on the market feature print heads that are placed on the same X-axis gantry, preventing independent movement on the Y-axis. This limits these ‚Äúsemi-IDEX‚Äù machines to print modes that are synchronous on the Y-axis'   how would they get independet x/y for their printer
nah, thermwood printer, from tct3sixty
pretty cool idea for better adhesion
discord.com/channels/641407187004030997/812082365270196274/863223111146012672
Like linear rails on a ender 3, it doesnt change much but why not
I think its more for the fun of it, 2 for x and 2 for y is reasonable and makes sense on crossed gantry but 8 is more for funsies
At the end of the day, vez gets the final call and we're just waiting on him
It's a tough situation, don't wanna burn bridges with our trademark holder but also can't ignore what they've done
I think Ill buy this time around
Feeling hyped for the kits üéâüéâ
at least for the uk thats what it seems
some regions only show vat when at checkout i think
do you lose out on money during the event, or is it the same for you
cool, thank you!
<@798489761970782229>  is the  price in f1nch's photo correct?
honestly, i think its people using the mobile app just bugging. wait til the proper release or judgement
must be the mobile app being funky, shouldnt be able to see the price i dont think
i dont think anyones added to cart, plus theres always gonna be another run
yours must be buggin
huh
ah, thanks for th info, it seems a couple sellers in the flashlight community are also in that area
hey <@798489761970782229>  what city are you guys in, a couple other aliexpress sellers i follow have also gone into lockdown
At least you didn't do what I did. Mine didn't have a physical diag pin and I spent 4 days trying to diagnose it, just to realize there was no physical pin, had to solder a wire to a unused trace
true, but that wire splitter inside might not but im no pro
cnc kitchens totem pole nozzle did better for longer than a slightly modded nozzle
slightly higher sustained flow
Not sure of it's possible but could there be a flow splitter inside or would that not be feasible
Cool
<@798489761970782229>  is this a one off run or will there be more stock available in the future of the oldham couplings
<@798489761970782229>  are the Gemini boards high voltage capable
cheers
what happens after the first 100 customers and is this the dual chip board
ah it was not that
so ya know, you could ask them if it goes well
lgx lite looks more promising imo but i think i saw someone in the server making one recently
josh murrah is on 32v last i checked, you can still get fairly good speed at lower voltage
the HV variant, yes
ah thats the point, google translate or whichever translator probably see the terms as the same, assuming thats what theyre using
might be a translation problem but i think you mean the phrase ' high voltage' instead of 'high pressure'. although if you run that through a translator it might just show the same phrases
im a little out the loop, i know the hv mainboard is out but is the HV TMC5160 out yet
The hv is probably around 48v, formfactor i dont know
<@!318169587977814027>
is this public avaiolable?
When'd i break a drone with you?
Josh?
Ill just ask leon
Nop
HELLO
Got a skr v1.4 and pro for a different corexy
its been 20m
ill pkay tmrw then
oh no its a infinite loading screen üò≠
what do you have lined up to do?
ill start and let other people test then
whoop
yeh
i can add them mid playthrough tho?
do you know if cbbe and other player mods work on folon. or high fps physics fix?
gonna have to boycott the game. litewally unplayable /s
sad stuff
but i dont think they added my suburb
imma find my parents offices and hopefully visit my house
DEPLOYING TO THE LONDON STREETS
ü´°  SIR YES SIR
is this the scrapheap stuff?
i didnt download this myself it was here when i opened mo2
bowow
IT WORKS
now mods
it works
reinstalled xse
sorry - was just paused for a sec
now readding xse
okay no mods, no xse it works
the others immediately closed/crashed
it did that on the default xse option
yeah
okay - clear out xse then disable all m02 mods and try launch f4se loader
but nada
launching via f4se loader
ive disabled everything in MO2
what details should i tell you to get help?
i cant get the game to launch
ive got another issue
awesome thank you
it says compatible with ng but will it also work for old
and is 0.3 compatible with old gen
mb
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
except f4se
i installed all other reccomended folon mods tho
i get this error though
ty - just got it setup
if i want to use MO2 for FOLON and normal falloutv(2 installs) how can i set it up to switch what mods are loaded for each version?
i hate having to look in 10 menus for a certain bollard when building
is there a mod that lets you search the workshop with keywords
no worries - ive not got a lot of knowledge so some answers are better than nothing
ive had it on ghouls and robots but cant say i remeber it on a human
should i be able to shoot someones leg and have it come off while theyre alive
also does dismemberment work on cbbe?
also is there a way to tell settlers to move somewhere else, red rocket has 30 settlers üò≠
next playthrough im stealing your modlist and then adding a couple "cheaty" mods i like
this modding stuff is tufff
so when in doubt higher is better?
how do the files get used before the game is laucnhed during the install process?
gotcha, so both load order and install order matters
also, ill give that a good read, its too late for my brain to do any good work so ill check it tmrw
is that load order youre talking about
also does the order i install mods matter, if theyre mods that rely on eachother, like installing everything before f4se or smth
i dont really need it tho - life goes on
using nexus to look for barricade i couodnt find much like that bridge structure
oh gotcha
ske is not neccessary
mods requiring ske make it mandatory
dont intall mods that require it if you dont want it
should be patches available? or just ommit entirely
<@337640182499246081> do you know much about that ^
i saw a couple people shitting on it
opinions on SKE/SK before i install it
i forgot to get atoms judgement
how can i find grand zealot richter after succesfully replacing tektus in FH

this one?
or using quick connects but a skr 1.4 and octopus will work fine together
i would rather suggest something like3 huvud or another toolboard
how many steppers do you need
both?
Forstest
Alright discord it is
Alright im in your game, ill get the kosatka and all that ready
Cool
Middle left
On the left side
Yup
Discord or party chat
I got it last year
14
Just gotta ask, how old are you
Change of plan, i can heist now if you can. Ive yet to do the setups tho
<@!712308662005268522>  is this the printer you built with  fabhh
annex engineering
and i think somehting about better uv resistance
less fumes too
ASA is ABS but with less warping and more printability
no need for new metal bits when you change hotend
*hotend]
its so that they can make one toolhead that will work on every future toolhead
from f3d or is there a full kit?
preorder?
welp
true
cool, ill buy some
and it holds it?
so does the tube go in, then the thingy is screwed on and you just drill it out enough to allow the tube through
6mm iirc
I'm not the most thorough builder but at least the layer shifts looked cool
Or secure my glass plate very well
And didn't tighten my abl in all the way
LoL my I forgot to reinstall bed screws for a week after installing rigid mount
Not sure
Ohh on the adapter
M6 is what hotends use iirc
rigid bouden
cool
if youve got  a small length could you put it around a bowden tube and pull all the slck to the top and get a side profile picture
ah ive got no store that sells it, im ordering from amazon
ill grab some 6mm then
<@!126746418143559680>  do you know what id you used for the PET mesh
its been a while since ive been hands on witgh a printer but unless a mistaken something like 
did it not go well?
but drilling will be fine
well i can always have a short peice inside the hotend and not split inside the fitting and split closer to the inside of the hotend
nice, ill order one online as soon as i find a link for it
<@!126746418143559680>  would something like this 
Hot
Fires are very hit
true, thats why i fill my chamber with an inert gas like hydrogen
unless his chamber sits at a cool 300c then the wood will be safe without spark or flame, then it would need to be bigish flame since a small one would most likely char the wood and thats all, me thinks
its got a high flash point
without a flame it would be fine
Is it just barbed pipe fittings I'm looking for?
both fitting male and female please
<@!126746418143559680>  do you have any links for those fittings and a diameter on that steel wire
check <#748703302895796264>
can someone link me to mods for 1.13.2
Yeah, no worries. I get its discouraged
melt put the plastic
can always try roast it with a flame or in the oven
did the heat not help?
amd ket moving up sizes till it was really thin then pulled with flush cutters
had to do it with a nozzle once, used a screw removal tool (can also try that before drilling)
Cheers. I'll buy it soon
Ah sick. This is the build for me then. Do you know of it has a Ethernet port?
Don't worry. This will be mine for a year or two then passed to my brother who mainly does Roblox and Fortnite (F) so as long as this lasts me a year or two it'll have no issues with him
Ah so only one thing to upgrade and a decent cooler is ~30
I can always upgrade the cooler/case/faans at a later date if they need it
Nice. Thank you for all the help. Prebuilts are such a mess. And finding a good one is difficult
True that. One last question, these are all standard parts so in theory I could upgrade them later
Ah cool. Nothing to worry about then. Only downside is that ram but life isn't perfect
What's that f (on the CPU ) mean
Yup. A igpu with enough optimisation can do pcvr nowadays
6600xt is. I think
And this is definitely VR ready
And I can stomach the extra cost. My proper top top budget is 1k so I can always upgrade cooler
I've no clue about that CPU or if it's cooler is sufficient but specs look goof
I'll send mine
Adams got some good ones
Yeh seem fine

There are a few issues with this code. First, the function changing() has a variable number1 in the parameter list, but the function uses a variable named n instead. This can cause confusion and should be fixed. Additionally, the function does not return the modified list, so it is not actually modifying the input list in any way.

Another issue is with the for loop in the main code block. The loop is supposed to iterate through the list of numbers and symbols and perform the appropriate mathematical operations, but the loop condition is incorrect. The loop should iterate for int(len(n)/2) iterations, not len(n).

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the input string contains only a single number, without any symbols. In this case, the code will not produce the correct result.

Finally, the code does not handle the case where the input string is not a valid mathematical expression, such as when it contains multiple consecutive symbols or when it ends with a symbol. In these cases, the code will produce unexpected results or errors.

well darn
aw shucks i designed the next one to be 120.7
theres no better feeling than watching your hard work speeding around at stupid speed
i didnt notice that
hahahahahaha
give it one more shot
im closing in on 16......in a year
Ah I couldn't figure out what idlw meant
imo it should be the 'latest' or last timezone to exit the 31st
lol his bank just sees a couple thousand disappear all into aliexpress in one payment
got one where you try to show the ringing, its hard to see here without any harsher lighting
i think so, do you have a photo of a sample print
it helps hide imperfections in the walls or detracts from others
sorry mate, most of those 'galaxy' filaments are glitter, it is a lovely print though
ah yeah croxy cartesian then
like a i3 cartesian
does corssyxy/croxy just refer to how its arranged
ah so its a crossxy/croxy wich is cartesian
hm, ill go ask in the croxy server
wait, then whats crossxy
that ones got 2 motors per axis and far shorter belts than corexy
yup that ^
8 total
4 per axis sorry
A k3 or Tycho is a crossxy, no belts at the toolhead and AA incredibly short belt path with up to 8 motors per axis
Also do you want that spike at the right or left of the graph and tall or short
Since it's so rigid
Although cross xy seems to be winning the race
can it remove a duck
the true method for fan testing
fun news for you, 
vrollers can do speed just fine as far as i understand, they just dont have great longevity at speed
Croxy? K1/2?
What machine is it
whats gone wrong
btt
tldr: free stuff
make sure to try their support, i heard it went well for @ haagendazpizza
could link them couldnt you
in this case, coming from expeirience, budget is more expensive. just buy the midrange that gives you good upgrade paths and will work reliably
but a stepstick board will leave uyou with more upgrade paths and cost less overall
looks like generic 3010 or 4010 fans and stepper
im not sure if you would have the coldest part first to preheat or last to stop it from being too melty
like a cool breeze hitting your face while you stand in a fire doesnt make you cold, you just stay hot overall
thats what i thought first but with no thermal separation it would just adopt the hottest temp throughout most of the nozzle
interesting, in the name of accuracy or for a dual stage heater
Nice. Stick a thermistor in there of you've got a spare port just for the sake of data
Just be careful with leaks but I'm sure if you've got it lying around you're no noob
Otherwise water cooling or a smaller passive cooler+ quiet fan works well
If you're bothered a local e waste collection area may let you snag a PC or two and their CPU coolers will work fine. Theyll just be bulky
Perhaps time to get some thermal paste and a cooler
Step two: speeeed
Step oen: Put printer on inflatable
If you submit with that just point a torch up from the bottom
Technically yes but we would just ask you to light it properly and it would look the same
So speed up til  quality gets bad and submit that, then improve
Whereas the quality is far more fine grained
Speed gets you points but quality also plays a role, i beleive the time points are in categories so a 15m print could get the same speed points as a 20m print
Pardon?
Good luck
damn, nice quality too
id say equivalent to my corexy but faster
nice, vez got one a few seconds m=behind urs but i havent seen what it looks like
im going for good looks since main printer is down so im tuning my printer and getting it looking good
Iirc its a vzbot or similar looking but uses mostly ender 3 hardware
quality also gets points so
damn you are committed, i think honourable mention and role at minimum for him if he doesnt want anything monetary
September 6th uk goes back so end of september is good for me

Damn, nice work <@!276016956245540864>
Cool
<@!276016956245540864>  the bot removes the react after i react, if i click it and unlick it goes away, is there a way to keep it on
yeh im limited in number of reacts
nope guess not, the user will have to include !number !numbers in their message in that order
can bots not trigger eachother
ah, not sure yet
lemme fix that and then itll be done, theres 2 commands that are needed since i only get 3 reations but ill let modbot deal with them
got it
gimme a sec but i think the voting bot should work
cool, so i can put a command into the auto reply for another bot to respond
ah for the numbers, sure
not sure how to have it react with those though
yup
Nah this is a test run kinda thing. We'll get gooder at then once we do moee of them. But wr could hold a mini beta comp with a few users just to get good
In the entry
included k mee6 comand that is included
Its good man. Ivw got summer holiday and my responsibility is to just not die. Im happy to judge quality
well theres some missing extrusion on the top down shot corners so i would do a 2
@here everyone happy with this
lemme delete all this apart from the rating thing and then we submit our score per category and overall score and then average them out and reply to the submission
sharp corners and no buldge/ detents
and 60 minutes = 1 point and every 5 minutes less yield an extra point for a maximum of 12 points
* layer stacking (no ringing or skips)   1-3
* side finish (no vertical seams/no banding/zits)   1-3
* surface finish (smooth top/bottom layers)   1-3
* even extrusion overall (sharp corners and no buldge/ detents)   1-3
yup, thats much more thought out
so 6 for sub 8 instead of 5 for sub 10
or how about 6 for speed for a even number
yep
ez to choose
yeah thats better
maybe extra point for speed then
the lower the score the more rubbish it is
if theres ringing all over you get 1 and the top layer is all splotchy its another 1
yup
thats pretty good for quality and speed is above
* layer stacking (no ringing)
* side finish (no vertical seams/no banding/zits)
* surface finish (no ironing)
* even extrusion overall
nah i think 1-5 and added all together should suffice, and a set of criteria (i think maze had some) would be fine. time wise 5 is sub 10min; 4 is sub 15min; 3 is sub 20; 2 is sub 30; 1 is anything above 30
are we doing community rating or are we rating
with dutchdudes first submission in we should get started on ratings

You did it 5min ago
Oof
Why'd you friend me?
tbf they give credit in the description
Is the hydra just the z axis upgrade
I had a ton shipped to my grandparents in the USA and just carried it back in a suitcase
warping without a good enclosure, nasty smell that lingers  it isnt very UV resistant. ASA solves all of those
usually PolyLite ASA, my PC roll ran out fairly recently
also, loving the filament. i keep a roll for showcases and gifts
cough ·µá·∂¶·µÉÀ¢·µâ·µà cough
its what the motor you sent is for
perfect timing
honestly couldnt tell you
structurally petg might be a bit worse but i havent tested and i dont know if anyone else has
assuming they dont need to be high temp i dont see a reason not too
ive done abs+ no enclosure at 260 and been fine with layer adhesion
13?
dm when
poggers
Pavlpv?
We leave now
Why
Nice
Are u at samuels house yet
<@689148727818059859>  u there?

no
Just use snap map
Ez
Just get on train
I twit
Yeah fine
We go circle line
By the machines but don't exit
Yeah, we'll be at the exit but inside
Yeh on zipcard
It's 2.50 to get to Heathrow
Never had to tap out
We'll meet him inside
<@558976020317732874>  sure we'll meet you outside the station
When you get here?
But you can also go to Marc at Liverpool sreet
We here rn dylan
Where you going
Yeh
<@792752630362406922>
Where u now
Rest is food
There's 1 fruit stall
<@792752630362406922>  u dummy
Looks like a looser
Ew
Training
Pog
Y
Less effprt
Bit instead of me and Jonny going over to you by care you go to mine by car and Jonny walks
I doesn't matter who we go to, we end up at the same place
Casue we going to cockcfosters station, and it's less effort for everyone
then cockfocker
<@!689148727818059859>  we goingto mine then
Is that the train or tube
With guaranteed seat
Also trains every 5nminitd
Isn't cockfoster closer
If we go cockcfosters than go to me house nt samueks
For 8
What food
But where?
E.g
It's quite uppity
My dad's abeen
Yeah but spitlfileds is expensive
Kosher, lots of food, fairly cheap
Works for everyone
How's about brick lane market
Typically you're stupid
And crowded
And busy
Isn't that very pricy
but we get street food first
if u dont like the street food get mcdonald
no
and probs a mcdonald 5m away
its got street food
and cheap korean and halalala food
yeh
dw theres plenty of food and we can stop there, walk around then get back on the train
we meet at leather lane 12 30 outside farrigndon station
whats in bank
what is in bank, idm going as long as theres something to do
matthew
sincerely
so you can stop being fucking retarded
i hope this helps
faringdon station
so we go there
but leather lane is on my line
k
how about heathrow airport
leather lane
hows about
so
thats inconvenient, not a direct route, u dolt
where else we go
gud food
also <@!607420430633926687>  ive been to leather lane market
ah alright, as long as we there that long
makes no difference
1 30
vs 1230-530
130-530
cause im meeting my dad in london so if we go later i wont have ti go home and back
instead
can it be 1 30
leather lane market or bank
and where we going
if not can we
are we meeting at 1 30?
<@!792752630362406922>  you idiot no matter how fast you go its still half a mile
we go to lather lane market
sad
watch
<@!540888808640741376>  new camera
anyone wanna play phosomophobia, no mans sky, minecraft or vr
on tost
where?
sure
<@792752630362406922>  no point meeting there, it'll be busy and no cell to find eachother
But why bother doing it at kings cross
Why not at bank
Bottom g
get hydrated g
yikes
chanted?
im sure no one will notice
smooth
agree
lemme go ask
sure
We're paying now then finding u

Where are you now
<@607420430633926687>  just check Google maps and send name
Shite internet
Nvm
Then how we getting there
How
<@607420430633926687>  what's restaurant we going to
F in the chat

Bruh
See u soon
On the bus
Jonny and I lleave at 11 40
Meet at 12 30
Also <@607420430633926687>  where was it you wanted to eat
We should visit China town, Covent garden and totenham court road
Ah sure
Or if you know the end of Hamilton road furthest from the roundabout would be even better. But either is fine
Sure.
I can meet you there at 11 40
Yep
Lemme gift in a sec
Sure
10 40¬ø
Yeah. Later tonight
Sure I can do then
i can go at anytime
lol
nice job
for a second i thought the beginning was the serious work
just to check, but have you tried drying the asa
phew good luck, i get bogged down on one
thats the board youve got except yours is v2 and theyve got a v1 i think
vrooom
Ah cool. That is so confusing
1 tenth in normal numbers is 0.1 Wich is 2.54 mm but in maching I'm told it's 1/10 of a thou
I thought they went in at a diagonal
F3D sells aluminum with slots iirc
a little pricy tho
i was looking at these guys a while back for oldhams
this is the best i could find thats similar
mellow was working on them last i heard
<@!557220161346600971>  was it this?
might be a private/unlisted vid
it was a direct link i saw it through
same
cant find a photo of it but it was brass
yeah it was brass
lemme go look
ive only seen a brass one ( i think)
what metal would you use?
iirc theres some metal ones floating around that worked alright
beautiful
machine
I'm no pro but CNC milling your peen can't be fun
or 22 human molars for the carriage. wich makes that ridiculously light
honeslty though thats crazy light, that ~98 paper clips one small mouse or 26 cheez its (for entire gantry)
idk man seems kinda heavy to me
Cause I'm  C O O L
And we all pretend it's ironic
Haha I talk to friends like this
Top that <@202189639593754624>
Pretty heckin pogchamp if you ask me
That ting must cost bare P's to make, gotta be rich AF to afford that dope ass machine
No cap I pogged looking at that
That's bare drippy my guy, it's dripped out in some epic gamer bling ting
Doggers
Pogchamp
Correction, looks heckin poggers dude
Sorry I skipped yours- was just cramming a few in before a flight from my phone
Congrats on the build, the green accents look dope
<@692801013039759443>  #169 üéâüéâüéâ
Ah nice
How do you like them? Iv only seen them online
Oh I see, do you have those chip shaped drivers for xy?
<@826874789037080587> nice build, looking at the board, is there any cooling for those stepsticks? I see some by the easy sticks (I think that'd the name) but not by the right hand side
damn! it loosk like its skipping steps in the second video, or is that just the path its taking?
what speed is it going in that clip
<:sadge:1004524978240229386> sadge
or its a funny fan
oh yeah, onless you meant to suck air out
we can change the guide to reccomend youtube, the bot will use any link we give it
Just for sake of comparison
I wish I could see their server info
I quite like the way it is now
Ah cool
Last I remember it was honour based system (maybe)
How's voron do their serials anyways
Blink and you'll miss it
Not sure if there's any other good number comming up
I think I'll aim for 111
At first, you'd know exactly when to expect the next serial because you'd regularly talk with every builder. But servers grow and people don't always have to be active. That's what's great about vzbot. It's so widespread, over different ages, countries, languages (although it's still mostly men in the server so we could probably be a bit more gender diverse)
Oh no sorry not like that. Sometimes we'll have users who have 0 roles and a completed build. Or just people who've been active on the Facebook page instead of here
now theres 1 every 2 days or so from random users
ikr. at first we had maybe a serial a week and only from well established users who messaged all the time
sorry for the dealy
looks like youre the last in the manually generated plates, we might've been switching over to have the bot do the plates around the time you registered and forgot to send yours
here you go
ill send you one once im out of lessons
works really well so far
ive a similar setup, cheap microswiss knockoff heatsink , genuine all metal heatbreak , cheap volcano block and heater combo
<@702916205991952435> i really love the electronics setup, absolutely stunning
Welp, that makes gpio redundant
I think for my build I'll try fit a lot of electronics into a atx pc case. Built in cable management and a steel chasis makes mounting with magnets ez
Otherwise larger form factor PCs are pretty cheap second hand especially if you don't need high end parts
I think the biggest issue is no gpio for IS
wooooo üéâ ! #50 to taylor
ill send it now
nah we might have missed it
did we forget to send it
crap my bad, do you still need i can dm them to you
jeeeez
i told you i code in english
shees
i cant code is candian
im no fancy franch boy
english
whats in <#857878337703247872>
dunno what you're on about g
dunno actually
<@!329284552243544065>  i was wrong, the channel titles are a little off, we just finsihed #19
burglary time
good news
are you in germany?
yeah dont think we can reserve numbers, really sorry
what condition is it in
whats your printer like rn
you can ask the current requester to cancel before you get yours in
we just finished number 20 and 21 is in progress, sorry mate
printing on a bed
Shorts, painting tips, updates and 3d printing reviews
ill be on in a sec
cool
can i join <@!792752630362406922>
nope
I can do any day
by rare americans
hullubaloo
I'll join if I can sign in on steam
thanks
is that from the test
aight
never substitute if the terms started as x squared then?
How's you sell mine
Noooo
Ohhh
Weird
Only 190
Heh 6mil
Yeah
nn
igtg now
thanks
hey marc can you lesve it runnng my pc keeps disconnecting
code
weeee
damn thats quick
here you go
lemme go ask
i beleive so
here ya go, this should be it
ah yeah, i had the same problem, i would keep it around for fans,thermistors and other io
oh nice, what board did you have before?
cya
yeah he pretty much all knowing
yup, then i promoted maze on vzbot after he promoted me in zero g
then i joined the vzbot server early on and got into admin again
from the zerog server i was first 100 ish i think and was active, then they gave me admin role to just make sure there wasnt much offensive on the server
oh definitly, all the admins are talking about giveaways but no ones got the money to do it, but since i dobt have any bills to pay i can send the money
yeah its so that i can still get hired even if theres other, better, workers out there
yeah anything under 18 is a minor but 16+ get adult pay
yeah under 16 dont get payed much
for minors
4.35 gbp is minimum wage
yeah UK
lucky, your minimum wage is far higher than mine too
damn, you just show up?
devin from from vzbot lucked out and got hired at 
damn, how many hours a week is that?
yup, i just gotta get the motivation to apply, where do you work  at
ne regrets tho
funnily enough, the only reason i got into custom builds was cause a friend i lent the printer to forgot to fully screw in the hotend carriage during an upgrade and i was too dim to figure that out and figured linear rails were the only fix
i got a cr10s pro at 13 then the ender 5 a few months later and upgraded to zerog a year or so ago and now im looking for a cheap x5s or ender 5 to build a vzbot with
i built a really early version of the zero g and am now looking at building a vzbot
yeah majority of the regular users are 28+
rudra is 16-17 too
didnt know anyone else did this
yeah turned 15 last month
# 31 for adder
What of we take the drivers that survive and put them into a separate group and selectively breed them for super drivers <:thinksmart:665708349035249705>     
/S
looks good to me boss
For both pc and phone
It adds most premium features except lyrics and downloads
Done üòé
Xmanager and spotx/spicetify
Spotify does that no?
My old bits are all twisted from torquing, my ifixit don't twist üòÇ
Ey nice they're a massive step up from what I used to use
wut
for me coming from the UK, that project is crazy and so is attending MIT
thats a lot
thats almost 7 years of the median UK wage without spending a single penny
im well off but not *that * well off
shhh were still part of europe
god damn
these maker portfolios are crazy
idk man 20k is 20k, its an insane amount of money no matter what country
im cooked
christ someone donated parts for the braking, steering and wheels. that 20k doesnt cover the whole car
crazy stuff
like i weighed up buying my 1.3k vzbot for like half a year and then worked a full summer for it
he says he spent two months researching the car build before coming to the 20k price tag and going for it. like that is so little time
agreed
just meantioned the parents not being engineers because it means its his skill and work, its not him tagging along with his moms projects
damn
watching his other video he says neither parents are engineers but he has around 200 projects averaging $30 each + his electric car costing ~$20000

absolutely loaded
same üò≠
dude this is so impressive
i actually dont know
FAA when i just wanna have a little fun
its interesting how different hobbies can be in their communities
their only use is for me to look at and go oooooohhhh ahhhhhhhh but 3d printing has a use
every flashlight i own is a fun gimmick
yep, 3d printing is a tool
flashlights are a LOT harder to stumble upon
3d printing vs flashlights
i guess the slow growth of the hobby helps a bit, 3d printing exploded
theres one dude, "grizzly" who used to reply within minutes to every reddit post. dude was a machine
tbf in the flashlight community you:
need some amount of skill for customs
need lots of money
need to care lots about LEDs and performance

so the crowd are pretty nice
i do agree, but i genuinely think flashlights are one of those exceptions. the mods of the discord are incredibly inactive and in my 4 years theres been 1 problem user who was quickly shut down in every conversation
true, but budget light forum is almost as old, same for the reddit. blf recently went through a overhaul which upset people but thats the only controversy i can remember.

cpf has had issues with all accounts needing manual verification and getting rejected, random posts being removed, poor site maintenance etc
those experts might not be active anymore, a lot of well known guys from the early days have passed
iirc the moderation changed and got really strict and everyone moved to budget light forum really
Candle power forum
Taschenlampe forum
Budget light forum
Those are the 3 big ones I'm aware of
Then there's the Reddit and two discords
I'm not sure, do you know the name of the forum?
In this clip a moth flew into the beam
Gonna make it a handheld model
9.2 million candela, 17k lumens, 6km range
Not quite my target range but decent
Yup üòÇ
I build some customs tho
Yeeep, my collection is around 30 lights and it's considered small
Probably because we all know it's a useless hobby, there's like 3 trolls ever that everyone knows and ridicules
Even the online forums and reddit
Although I think the hobby as a whole is like that
My flashlight discord has been really great
Ah that's fair I guess
i think beter moderation and small communities is key
i think it depends tho, because ive been around 3dp discords since 13 and i was a bit of a nuisance for sure but more in that i couldnt think for myself too well and had 0 skills (not that i have any now)
Discord the platform and UI or the communitys and vibe
goodd luck
and theres a looot of tape
üòÆ üî•
12v lipo and inverter?
Or stick it to a heatsink and use a white 3d printed reflector (look up hybrid mule flashlight to see what I mean) and get a work light going
Scrape off the phosphor for a 450nm funky disco light
out of interest whats the application?
my dupont jumper cables never seem to stay connected ü§∑
like easy detach?
Sorry for spamming this daily
Some poor bug flew into the beam
super glue
hey <@494918092351209472> ill be a secs sorry man
Sweet, hopping on
Is 20m enough time?
Give 10m, gotta see how long until my dad's back
Cleaned and glued shut üòé
Very mild
Gore warning
Every 3dp project requires a blood sacrifice
Sweet, I should be available whenever
Also, any tips for scraping off the pei sticker on a build plate
Yeah
am i searching wrong in jlcpcb?
what footprint should i assign it if i need to solder wires to it
got it ü´°  and what do i do for my power connection points
hows this
DMN2040U?
hm
i cant find any up to date guide
im not sure what to do tbh
No, windows 10
gonna take a lunch break and come back
i think i did it wrong
just chrome being weird
hm
their download doesnt work
yall are the best
thank you, for now ill just continue with the through hole version, same for the mosfet
i only see the bc547 as a through hole component, is there a alternative or have i searched wrong?
ah okay cool
sorry, meant to phrase it, i will through hole the LED and mosfet (maybe) and everyything else will be done by jlcpcb
resistors will be jlc done, im only doing LEDs and mosfets
idk that seems small
okay cool, and what size resistors should i do, 0805?
reckon i should do a white/ coloured LED or stick to IR
let me go do some KiCAD stuff and come back
oooh phew okay good
darn i wonder how the original gets way without 12v then
and use higher resistance for the LEDs
is it possible to make everything run on 12v then?
im just wrapping wire around a spool
coils need specific voltages üò≠?
the hardest thing in my curriculum is potential dividers and internal resistance. we dont get to do much circuitry üòî
is vcc the same as 5v? i know what it stands for but i dont actually know what it means
thank you
you guys are the best
but i think thats fine
okay no resistors
swap it with the LED? or just swap its position
how do i invert it? so its off until the photodiode isnt being lit up, then when theres no light the mosfet turns on
for now ive just left out the resistors so its easier for me to look at - once ive got this sorted ill come back and add them all
after the photodiode is that a 510 ohm resistor and then a 10k
i think i maybe get it
i need to connect +5v to the base, and it will aslo have the photodiode connected and when the photodiode has light on it it will conduct and the bjt doesnt allow electricity to flow. then when the light is interupted the base is powered and then electricity flows?
okay that makes sense - when current flows in the photodiode itll turn on the switch?
thank you
dang
okay so i think npn is what i want because im switching the ground side? so then this circuit (i need to add resistors still) will switch on the mosfet whenever something comes between my my LED and photodiode
how do i know
and does it matter if i chose npn pnp
does the bjt need high current capabilities?
cool okay
hey <@494918092351209472>  should i be designign this to be sm or through hole - im going to pay to have jlcpcb assemble it ($100 budget that i can make full use of)
10 bulb array gonna go crazy
My friend about 1km away could see the beam pretty bright
Cool üòé
really?
its just the ones i got in a 10 pack ages ago that ill use ü§∑
yipyipyipyip
30m of design got me here
im only now getting into it so its mostly that im unfamiliar with it - ill @you if i get proper stuck
not me then <:agony:672200212252590089>
is altium better?
im tryna copy the videos design - but ive got a friend who knows even less than me who im doing it with
im new to it and electricity just pains me
kicad hurts me
thid is my first time doing pcb design so imma be here often üò≠
gotcha
whys there another FET
and does the circuit work where when the infrared LED is disrupted it makes the mosfet switch on and energize the coil?
its for one 
could i get an ID on what these are
i think 1 is a IR LED, no clue about 2, 3 is maybe a amp? and 4 is a zener diode?
imagine how sick it would be if i find someone with a large drone, we build a fake UFO and fly it around and light beacon under it so it looks like a tractor beam
cause thats no fun
i gotta figure out the angle to tilt all the bulbs tho to have them converge
üòà
the brightness and intensity would be lethal
genuinely what will happen if its powered on indoors
hit 200k lumens (rivals the brightest flashlight but mine will be sustained brightness) and have a range of 60km
discussed it with a friend - its doable and now i know what my next goal is
10 bulbs, total of 92 million candela
draw 3kw total <:agony:672200212252590089>
might have to build a large array of UHPs' when i get to uni
do you pay for it in university?
not yet
good thing i dont pay for electricity <:thinksmart:665708349035249705>
3d printing enthusiasts can appreciate a good injection molded part, flashlight enthusiasts can enjoy darkness
i dont think a flashlight is the same tho, mine usually arent on for more than a hour, are highly directional
i agree, i hate my houses motion activated lights and my neighbours floodlights and how my neighbours leave their lights on all night
thats why i want it localised to my suburbs ü´∂
one of them in a handheld device (mini gun esque form factor acceptable)
you ever see the luxor hotel
i want one of whatever they have
thank you
imagine a larger reflector ü§§
from a teeny weeny reflector
6km of throw
9.2 million candela !!!
measured my searchlight
yall
üéâ
Woohoo
Ah nah I'm at 17k
I've Def got you in tint and CRI tho
What's your lumens, might have you beat
sorry terrible pun
i think ive got the wrong beacon
<@592032818364809217> is my beacon working right?
send it to me
itd melt so fast üò≠
i hope all my fellow londoners looking for meteors see my beam and think its aliens
ü´°
its a shame its a parabolic reflector and not elliptical cause ive got a massive lens
and then tomorrow head out to the countryside for some ranged photos and some candela measurements
later tonight imma try pointing it upwards and see how it is
one stuck their head out the window to see whats up
its only 9pm üò≠
I was stood a few metres away and the beam was intense enough to heat my hand
30km range is the goal
tryna make a super mega bright light
250W at ~70lm/W so 16,000 lumens
lit up my room even in full daylight
got the projector uhp bulb working
We good
It's not plugged in
Nevermind ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It's under the impeller (I think that's the right word)
I can't get to the PCB without breaking it
It's a Toshiba SF81H12
Does it need a signal on yellow
But nothing is happening
I've connected red and black
I've got a 3 pin fan connected to a 12v supply. It has a red, black and yellow wire
fan driver is probably for all the 12v blower fans for cooling no?
if this isnt something doable via discord / without a working system first then fair enough
Then from there to audio and speakers and mobo etc
This goes onto the blue connector
Afaik the bulb can't vary brightness very well so I assume it's in the LCD that they do the "baby stepping"
0 results when searching any text from the psu
nah its from some ollld sanyo projector
why tho? (im curious)
let me check, unfortanutely i think theyre all grey
yes
when plugged in it got a few mv output
the top of the board is AC input, the middle is the dc output
yeah that was the mobo before it died
ah darn the mobo is dead
How do I go about convincing it to turn on
I'm tryna get a PSU to power up but without the motherboard attached
Sweet
What's the best source in the UK for a beacon and new bed? I'd like to get quick
Can't use the other side that's textured?
Damn
It managed to carve the bed scanning pattern into the bed too
That's a shout
TBF it's double sided
Like scrape off the PEi
This is so atrocious
I'm going to buy a beacon and a new build plate
It dies so fuckin often, loses connection for fuckk all reasons and is so inconsistent it's not even funny
I'm so done with this cartographer bullshit
Nothing changed üò≠
There's a 2mm +ve offset too
What the fuck cartographer
its got more springback
for faster speed
yall its clearly a compliant mechanism
done üòé
SHIT THE CRIMP FELL OFF
When it dies I'm going for a beacon because tap üòãüòã
Its someone's old one destined for the bin
It was a free gift üò≠
What moldy lettuce said
any technigque or things to aim for
ill try smash it down then
for a cartographer bed probe
because i dont have the suitable tools to make another
my plan is to try flood it with solder to establish a connection
took me 8 hours today of troubleshooting and intermittent failures
but it stopped working last night
its been running for a year working fine
ive already got a few greys
he'll be chuffed youve said that
but we're a family of baby faces
oh then my dads older
oh yeah my dad is younger then, not by much tho
whats your age?
nah thats my dad
i just made this
yall wanna see something cool
üíÄ
m21g is also a option
both ship from china
id also check out the 3x21b and m44 from convoylight.com and intl-outdoor respectively
careful if you do order it
sp36 is a different model - veeery different
hang on tho
presumably what you have now doesnt even touch 1k lumens
so i figured better perfomance same ff
its not my first choice but i assume you already own that 26650 light
whaddya think <@286949943632068609>  joining the light side? ü§®
it is also 26650
and ip68
because its a boost driver
really well regulated
see how flat that line is
if you need range and flood id reccomend getting a second small light for range
6hrs of 650lm or 2hrs of 1500
70cri, a bit of tint shift, fairly wide beam since large die + textured reflector but itll still reach a decent distance
sustained for 2 hours?
or the fc11c
if youll look at other options, the sp33s is a great choice for a efficient and bright light thats pretty cheap
but if youd rather keep what you have, either of the two 
also also - it looks to be ipx4 rated - depending on how heavily you use it you might be better off with something more sealed
also do you have a photo of the LED
5mm tall each
does it have long springs on both ends?
<:doubt:710220943674441770>
i doubt its particularly efficient
would you get a different one?
what light?
and theres not many 26650 that do that
depends what light i suppose. most of my lights require high drain
26xxx is a dying format, you can try the vapcell k62 but ive heard anecdotal issues with self discharge. alternatively this 
but youd be happy with 18650 + spacer?
do you need the capacity of a 26650 or high drain?
I'll check if it's legal in the UK and grab some
Thanks for telling me about you experience
So I might as well nab some?
It looks like the stuff doesn't expire
Like if someone fainted and i give it they won't die
Tho id worry about mis administering it
I'm occasionally around people who do, and I travel around London so probably
Is it legal in the UK?
Is narcan something I should carry? I already keep a few basics in my backpack whenever I leave the house
cool, im trying to build a hand cam for livestreaming and for recording timelapses over my workbench
cool - reckon someones already made the code for it or ould i have to code it?
no monitor involved
ah so what about a raspberry pi/linux computer? could i set it up so that on boot it starts the recording and when i click a button it stops recording and uploads to 1drive or something?
could it be done with a esp32 sorry
esp32?
dang  - i cant think of any ways to utilise a pi pico then
any chance a pi pico would be able to stream / record from a webcam and send it via wifi to a computer on the same network
also any project ideas?
https://hackclub.com/bin/
is there much klipper stuff i can do with this?
i need the model to be solid
i wanted the overall thickness to be ~2mm but its made roughly 0.6mm walls with a airgap
but ive got another issue
then used the offset tool
i managed to do it in meshmixer
does that make sense?
and then add thickness
like imagine i have a model of someones face and then take the outer most features of their face and make it a surface
is there a tool to take a stl and take a surface and separate it from the model and then give it thickness
heres an example of the models
i can do it with just the front layer and use a mold release - then i wont need to fully dissolve the mask
maybe i should buy pva
itd rely on the polysmooth fully melting
id do a shell on the inside and out to fully capture the teeth and mounts at the back
and use isopropyl to dissolve the printed mask
then insert the teeth inside the cf
could i then print this in polysmooth and lay cf over it
ive used meshmixer to cut the teeth off the model and the mounting parts at the back
I was thinking of this sort
Oh I see
That's what I considered but issue is I can't really disassemble, how do I make it snap on and have a screw
Ah yeah the ring is pretty warm, it's just glued tho and ABS
The light is a snap on pipe clip thing, it can't support itself and keeps sagging, how would you guys fix it
Designed and Printed a soldering station and light for my desk
Same, I've read lots of dramaa
Is it not true?
I've never had a workbench before, so I'd love to hear feedback on what does and doesn't work from everyone with experience
The whole workbench is designed and built by me. It cost 11 GBP total
Maybe some day I'll hook up a vibration motor and do a frequency sweep. It'd be a fun project to compare furniture around the house
There's no wobble as far as I can tell on the actual table
Everywhere except the front is shaped like a H
I always mix it up on this table
Mb, 3cm
Pvc pipe frame to mount pegboard and cable mangage and for a camera rig up top
3mm granite
Rate my workbench
im not sure why
if i set the height correctly then the sketch wont resolve
im not convinced ive done the fins right
3d printable CAD vs openrocket sim
a8-3 engine
80m flight height
45m/s top speed
1.01 cal
hows this for a first DIY rocket?
What is that
brackets done üòé
[spongebob_sadge](
still no clue why my angles in CAD arent consistent across the three arms tho
if thats what you meant. then yeah im just bad at visualizing
in cad to add the 3rd arm or in slicer?
is there a way for me to share the cad for someone to look at. i havent a clue where ive gone wrong
but the plane is at a 45 degree offset
two arms give 30 degrees from the flat, one gives 45
i think im bad at CAD
wait
eh
what gives?
but 3 with a 45 degree cut does
no overhangs marked
but two arms with the 45 degree cut gives this
maybe im not understanding correctly
reckon they need supports?
overhang indicator thing
3hr 40m print time is rough, 250g
wtf
identical parts
supports? or nah
and theyre identical in length
on the 40 they appear more even in the slicer
how is a 40 degree offset better than 45 here
ah well, it doesnt matter too much, i changed the angle to 40+90 and left it at that
it happened on a cube i did the same thing to, it was off in height on one "arm" by about .6mm in height
yeah
its centered on the corner
hm its a 45 degree but its not even?
im tryna lock in best practice, since these are curved edges idk if the chamfer would work
this is also reasonable?
its like a frame thats ging above my desk made of pvc, to allow me to mount cameras, lights, holding arms etc
i assume theres a easy way
how did you design it? i used the chamfer to make a face and then a new plane and then some sketching and intersection stuff
sweet
yeah thats how i designed my first one
like printed with all 3 arms facing upward?
i asssume theres no perfect way to do it 3d printed
im making a 3 way corner bracket
sweet
ü§Ø i didnt know that tool exists
is there a way to get this smooth look on that corner that pokes out
this?
like with 3 connectors at 90
whats the best way to design a printable cersion of this bracket
ended up going with my own design
Ty dawg
Sweet
Oooh that is exactly what I was after
flashlight modding shenanigans
hows that, if the humps are painted red and white
christ, imma just go with a wave pattern on a hump
i want to make a display piece
like that
like with the side bumpy curb
i need a section of race track
i need hel finidng a 3d model
im in year 12
11-12 in first year of secondary (year 7). year 11 you have GCSEs' (general certificate of secondary education). year 13 (can also be called 6th form or college) is A-levels usually
From the earliest stage or like secondary
I got to work on both drivers cars and assemble parts for the upcoming race
Nope, penultimate
People would hand me expensive parts and be like "give it a lil chuck see how light it is, yeah that cost 15k don't drop it üòÇ"
Nah, still high school
Personally I'd rather spend a whole summer there
I'm 17 so as part of the UK curriculum we do a week of work experience/ internship

Got free tickets to the formula 1 Silverstone race from McLaren racing üòéüòéüòé
how come?
the foaming is a feature not a bug
same - i usually just accept the slight stringing
i should build one, all my filaments moist]
yall seen this
Anyone heading to Silverstone for the formula one this weekend
Lots of idiots in the comments tho
Thats a cool mod
thats just cheesy üòî
Though I'm not the target audience so that makes sense
But i was completely unaware of it til now
There's some old blog posts about ut
Yup yup
thats new
Ooh cool, are you making your own firmware and board?
I've got no technical knowledge on this, but what difference does it make having better step generation?
yeah were finally getting some vit d

not worth the effort?
why not find a 2s BMS with built in charging?
Convoy Aliexpress store (Store No. 330416)

Lucky Aliexpress store (Store No. 1191644)

these are some other places to check for batteries
are you running these in a 2p or 2s config?
does it need to be protected?
if you can wait a while, try aliexpress
nkon i think is a good spot for NL people tho i cant remeber exactly, ill ask around
and definitely dont buy the batteries from amazon
it wont, im pretty sure the pb2sl does though
the pb2s?
Are you ordering from nkon?
The protection circuit covers over charging, over discharging and over current
Yeah they'll be over discharge protected, depending on what you're powering you might not need a protected cell tho. Those xtars are just Samsung 50T
Yeah, is it because it's kinda stealing?
rate my photoshop skiillzz
theyre both solid, and a bit mroe flexible for charging batteries than the above options, the pb2s can have issues making contact with certain batteries - if theyre dented it can struggle)
also <@680802342039584871>  XTAR VC2 and  Vapcell SU2
xtar, the vc4s is my travel charger
ohyeah <@680802342039584871>
can also consider this, but its entirely unsuitable for 14500 cells as it only charges at 2A, but its reversible and has short circuit protection and is very small
only downaside is you cant limit to 1 A charge current. BUT its not that deep unless youre going to be runing this cell hard
small and not ugly
can discharge/ act as battery bank
decent charging, up to 2A per cell
check this
do you want the charger to discharge your cells and estimate internal resistance too, its good for monitoring cell life and matching pairs
discharge too? internal resistance?
more than one at a time?
18650 only?
one sec
whats your price range
ME ME ME ME
eh
"we dont know" "we know"
"special fiberglass reinforced belts" aint that standard gate belts?
Some of it looked nice before I got to it
It's all cheap isn't it
Time for the big scary parts
The PSU for the logic stuff looks okay
Anyways
I'd hope high budget as it's meant to be a pro model
im off to poke stuff
or should i be discharging everything
hey <@204642074732134400> do these sorts of psu have bleed resistors
it is what it is
itll reduce the size of my device tho
bleegh
if i cant fix it, ive got altrnatives but theyre much more effort
oh dear
From videos I've seen, capacitors pop, this was a very gentle thin wisp of smoke
Since the status LEDs didn't come on with a error or anything id assume it's the Power supply
Other than visually inspecting as best I can, what sort of points should I be checking continuity
Is there any components I should look at the most
It's a UHP bulb projector so there's some complex bits
Same, I don't know if the power is isolated but the control circuitry certainly is
I know roughly what section of PCB it came from
Itd probably be a visibly broken item if it smoked, but there's a lot of stuff here so if I can start to narrow it down
Yeah is this possible without it being powered
As soon as the smoke came out everything stopped, so it's presumably at the motherboard or the power supply
Nope
And on plugging it in the status LEDs don't turn on
My projector let out a teeny bit of smoke when I turned on the bulb
I know roughly where it's from but not really
In a complex PCB how would you go about finding a fault
and maths
i need a dale gpt for my physics lessons
thank you dale
and if i can say this in a very dumbed down way, it doesnt turn on because the variable resistor steals all the voltage
so from x to y is always 25ohm? and x to p can be any fraction of 25ohms
if you drew the two paths current takes how would you draw it?
ive got x and y backwards there
is it not wired like that so theres always 25ohms of resistance in parralel
ah okay, and had it been halfway you had have 25 ohm in parallel to the resistance of the bulb + 12.5 ohm
but is it because it because youve now got a 25ohm resistor in parallel to the bulb
i wouldve said that because the variable resistor has 0ohms resistance when at p the circuit would have nop resistance
could someone help me understand how to find the total resistance in the question with figure 14
anycubic
like anet?
oh yeah printer company
is it all3dp
I should've looked harder ig, the way I took it apart was goofy since this was hidden under oodles of other bits so by the time it was out so was everything around it
I really couldn't figure out what it was for
Ahhh it was near the bulb cage thing, so that makes sense, I'll want to hold it down then right?
The right image is apparently a end stop?? But I got this from a projector
Can someone help me Id these
Yeah, it goes around a high voltage bulb and is next to the audio/video IO
i hope üò≠
the video quality has been absolutely cooked but you can see the spark
hindsight is everything üò≠
(it went around a few high voltage parts)
i can check later, but id assume that its the whole piece as this part was used for shielding
shoulda checked that before resting my pcb on it for testing
not all plastic is a insulator
woops
Can you pet any old cow usually without getting hurt?
eh then its heated chamber
to simulate it ive offered a printer chamber or a heat lamp if i can find
im doing a friend a favour - they need to "simulate" a hot climate for a school project - theyre "developing" new ways to keep a house cool
UK
if i cant have it fast and cheap then its fine ill do it another way
gotta have it fast and cheap
what about threading two brass roads and then using hardmounted nuts to screw into - that way i can securely push onto the contacts - then i can solder to the brass contact rod
what if i blow really hard on a PLA mount ü•∫
shid
ill go look for the proper mount
dang
these fellas
oh right duh hang on
would it be wrong to use solder to connect it
and do you know how hot i can expect the ends to get?
awesome
ah yeah thats all fine
yeah 240v wall power, and because its a resistive wire i shouldnt need to worry about drawing too much current?#
can i plug it directly into the wall?
ive got a 240v 400W incandescent bulb id like to use for a couple hours as a heat lamp
ah yeah i put that question mark in the wrog spot
its got temp drift too right? but its accounted for
üòï
one google search is equivalent to his call to fame from that video
call me a skeptic but im sure every other industry was aware of why that style probe would be inconsistent
hes boasting abotu how hes the one who saved the PINDA and everyones jealous of him for it
oh dear
but i think a lot of it can be chalked up to coincidence not maliciousness
i see some of his points
yup
gang stalking core
new dpt video
oooh
what the sigma
erm
Whatd you take the photo with it's a really nice shot
Like you can have a rough guess of the answer fairly accurately
A lot of maths I do now feels intuitive, like finding the angular velocity of a clock and stuff. Does further on maths feel like that
I just learnt angular force, acceleration and velocity. I really hope we don't do that next

How
Fack no üò≠
what use case even gets you that sorta equasion [sk](
maybe not a solid 5, but theres at least 5 hours where theres less than 5m between uses
i use mine at least 5 hours a day
If it helps me in a exam it's worth it
i use it mostly in physics when they give me speeds in miles or weird units of pressure
Oh gotcha, I've got some basic conversions and they do work in equations but it doesn't cover all bases
Ooh that does sound nice. Tho I'd get no marks for using that üòÇ
What's dimensional analysis?
Ah that's fair
my calculator has both, self solver is fairly limited iirc but i never use it
oh okay, so why the preference for wolfram alpha
or is it just that WR is that much better
does math slow down at higher levels, like theres less calculations but theyre harder
thats fair
and none of my maths is at wolfram alpha levels
plus id always use a calc over a phone if both are at hand since the calculator has more functions and ive got muscle memory helping
in education means no devices with internet access
Plus changing modes with arrows only is a right pain if you know all the shortcuts already
Why do you like it?
And the new menus just aren't for me
5 years of muscle memory gone üò≠
Ah no ew, I'm not a fan

Smart, I'll do it with a sheet of fr4
ill 3d print them
do you guys have any tips or feedback on these designs
first two of twenty organizers im creating for my drawers. i gutted all my bedroom storage. one holds boxes of assorted heatshrink, screws, ferrules and other bits vertically. the other is for all my pens and luxmeter/ db meter/ opple lm4 (plus a small dumping bowl)
Thank you dale, I also wanted to check if you could explain it with momentum too. My friends solution used it but I'm pretty sure it's bogus
So it'll come to rest sooner
So f=ma, the mass is smaller on Q and therefore the same air resistance (F) is divided by a smaller number so the deceleration is larger
Naw just use edge for the annotations of pdf
No?
But not how you find the distance
I understand the time party
The answer is d
I could run two motors on this ring offset so ones always engaged?
Odds of this working?
I would use the original but I think I broke it already ü•¥
Also how can I match the gearing on this motor?
I wanna run this at 12v
Does it matter?
How can I figure out the voltage of a DC motor
I wanna try mount it on a spinning platform with a stationary LED
1&2 compare high and low cri LEDs
For inspection
Maybe a monacle would be nice
Imma set them aside for now and keep taking this projector apart ig
Rip üò≠
Probably but id need some guidance
I might just stick them in a flashlight, but it's a waste of some really nice optical lenses
2 make a real nice spot
Any ideas for a good use?
Other than as macro lenses
I thought they'd make good camera lenses but I can't get them to work
Got some lenses out of a projector
That's the sharpest I could get through them each
I was hoping to use them for some cool photos
It's currently 2x sets of 2 lense
Imma take it apart even further tmrw
Yeh idk I'm varying stuff but nothings working
Hm neither seem all too well focused
Any cool uses of lenses?
Any fun parts to look out for?
üòé
I'm taking it apart for sience
Mostly for the 250W UHP, I'm gonna repurpose or play with the other parts
I bought a sanyo xt16 pro for 99p
And partially disassembled
Removed it
im gonna be doing a large chunk of it with their programming team for the cnc machines and with the rapid prototyping team

part of the UK curriculum is a week of work experience (i think same thing as interning)
kinda, i think those are the same thing
[sunglasses3dverycool](
McLaren racing work experience locked in
the only safety i want to bypass is whatever stops it from turning on without the computer attatched
i moved where the AC input comes in from too but that was just moving the phytsical plug
i shouldnt be, only modded thing is the yoke
Might be some wires too close to the flyback
Gonna move some wires around tomorrow
And in the corner of my eye I saw something inside the electron gun
No image
Made a hiss
Needs the accompanying computer to power on
If my bros up I'll plug it in, if not imma sleep
Fair enough
Does it looks super not right?
But
Not liable
Why?
Anything obvious?
Would you look at my photo as a double check
Hm
I'll discharge them again after
But being nearby is safe to power it on?
Like if I touch it
ü§î
Not yet
What's the failure mode of a crt?
Gonna plug everything back in and fingers crossed it'll work
One coil had a resistor in parallel so I chose the other one
Couldn't nab a spar l/r one from school
It's a wimpy one
Very sad

Dang, can't find my amp with separate left and right for the crt
I just want it to be decorative
Waveform display ü•≤
To average out the l and r channel I'll just put them in parralel
Gotta find a donor 3.5mm jack
Next to add a 3.5mm jack and figure out what's v and h
Done the easy stuff
But that's not gonna be hv
Online examples show a audio amp driving it
That is odd
Oop
Do you know if the yoke operates at high voltage
But yeah everything is discharged
Or 2.1 I'm not sure
Fair enough
Yeah...he climbed a crane last week after school cause it looked sick
Ah okay, and the internal one is a coarser adjustment? And would they go in series or parallel. No worries if you don't know, I'm just curious
And is it safe to assume black and white are AC inputs, they're the only other plug on this PCB
I wanted to ask y'all if this is a focus knob, and if it is, how's it work electrically with the internal focus potentiometer
I fafo but with more research and caution
I tell him fafo but he doesn't listen
I still refuse to sit in the same room as anything he shows me
Safe
Is it deadly, he seemed certain that the low voltage would make it super sage5
But couldn't get thick wire
He wanted to recreate the electro boom 1 winding transformer
Fair enough
He wants it to as a minimum light up bulbs remotely
I'm his printing mule üò≠
I'll let him know
Wants to DIY it all
He's a top tier shmuck
Yeah that's what I'm telling him
For the Tesla coil
For a friend (for real), if I want a low power Tesla coil, would pulsed DC with a Arduino, a AliExpress function generator, a pwm thingy or a inverter
Also
Gonna stick it in with my computer or record player

I only ask about the dangerous stuff here üòÄ
I gotta repair a wire on the vertical cathode thingy
I can use a pvc pipe and strap if on?
It's safer to discharge than not?
Idk any better way
How come
Boutta discharge a crt
Yippee

Cool
Oh phew
Haha same
Is that advice or anecdotal?
should cover all 3d pritning related needs right
(it's gonna be 1 page üò≠)
If you don't mind sharing it, I'll see how far I get before finding something I don't understand
3d printing related*
Did someone from here write a dissertation, I'm looking for things to read over a holiday
üíÄ
cause theyre design involved a clamp made of POM
what kinda compression and time scale
FR4 too?
or aluminium
these guys used one blower at the end of a tube to "suck" air over it
it was a mount for a high temp arc bulb. in their proper use they have all sheet metal and large blower fans from multiple angles
guh
in a setting where they dont know the operating temps, but its likely close to 200c
by hobbysists
oh ive seen it machined then stuck into a high temp system
bruh
wtf ive seen it so misused then
yeah naw not touching it
fumes?
how come?
ooh hows POM for printing?
And if I use a glass/metal ring inside a hole that needs to be fairly precise dimensions would it stop the shrinkage
Ah so pet is my best option
That'd require a solid infill? And would probably change dimensions a lot?
Yeah, it's for a low stress environment so it should be fine in terms of creep and deformation
Or possibly nylon
So if I want super high temp ill find a PET GF/CF and anneal it
But then PETG wouldn't since the glycol makes it not crystalline
Annealed PET would have a godly HDT then right?
Does annealing work on ABS too? Will it also more than double it HDT
<@151900328961245184>  thanks for reminding me of this, its still holding at 140C
Pushing to 140
Still holding at 120
Oh yeah duh, recycled protopasta PLA
4x M5 nuts as weights
Annealed on the left, oven at 80C (probably inaccurate as it's a conventional oven not a precise one)
do you know where thats from
i remeber seeing somewhere that PLA has some stupid crazy high temp resistance after annealing
ty man
awesome
cool
print, put box over bed, run this gcode --->profit
yippeee
ill have to try that for some parts, 185C temp resistance is crazy (unless ive misremembered the numbers) this solves a big problem for me
How'd you program the temp drop?
Did you do it while attached to the bed and supports to try stop the warping?
Flashlights ‚ù§Ô∏è
So good
Faaawwwk
My old crapass turnigy dmm's test leads have 1-2ohms end to end
Got a ut60s
whos the groom? hes handsome üòÖ
The device only draws this current for a split second to charge a capacitor
I was hoping the extra limiter would bring down the current to a acceptable level
Can I get some electric advice. I've got a mean well ICL 16L but my circuit is 13A, would an  additional 5ohm NTC current limiter cause instability or anything?
Yippee
I ordered last year October
Finally making progress with getting a  outstanding order to ship
Oh true but the one I intend to use isn't bright enough to burn
Is shining a bright flashlight out of a airplane illegal?
Any way on Reddit to be alerted to every comment on someone else's post
Interesting, I'll keep that in mind when I use it next
Cool, the precipitate is that white discoloration shmoo around the glue right?
Huh so something in the wd40 partially dissolves it?
Glows green under UV too
I found uranium glass I think
Or does it fully dissolve it
Would it be the tiny amount of oil making it clear?
They're not usually for food
Yeah my knives don't get treated so nicely so I go for a large angle and a lower grit
I've got a 400/600/1000 oil stone, DIY strop and diamond compound
I don't have the proper stuff with me, didn't think to bring this time
They couldn't cut anything with the knives, not even when sliding them
Sharpened my grandparents knives with a mug
might be more common terminology in the flashlight spaces
Glow In The Dark
on the topic of UV, one of the really fun demos is showing how teeth and peanut butter momentarily GITD
ohhh i see
do all ceramic plates do that?
It looks so cool
The other big thing I want is uranium glass slag
That's so sick
I assume most of it is purchased?
I wish I had something that good
Man that's such a cool collection
And do you have short and long wave UV to view them
Do you collect fluorescent rocks only or a mix of rocks
Got any pics of that rock collection?
Ooh I've also had my eye on hyalite for a while
Conveniently my brother transferred schools to a uni in north Carolina so when I see him next I'm going to lend him a UV light to search for sodalite
They're on my hunting list
That and some sodalite
Yeah id love to have some some day
365nm light used
Found some uranium glass at my grandparents house

Ah cool, list mustve been outdated

I'd Definitely buy, it'll be interesting to see if most of my screws are over or under done
Cool
And for 3d printed parts
Like on a all metal printer what torque would I want
Hey <@680802342039584871> I'd Def get one of those if its fairly accurate, can I ask what part it would be useful for
Even my CAD isn't that wonky
üíÄ
What part is it? Maybe it was from a larger assembly that made sense?
Slice it and solder back together
That's what I was thinking
its changed a little, but thats the gist of it
one sec
i think slicing it up and adapting it for layers would work
ive designed a holder that keeps it captive
yeah sticky one isnt it
so best bet is lots of air and a HT capable holder
and ive got no clue where the heats gonna come from, but im pretty sure itll be the actual quartz tube which i cant heatsink
pretty much no good mounting points
im on a airplane so web browsing is pretty slow, its a osram pvip 180 e20/0.8
its made of glass (cold mirror coating) and a ceramic base
yeah, hang on lemme show u the bulb
hows the heatsink help tho
but it is super cheap since the grant would pay
thats why its a dumb idea
just a easy way to make a bulb holder
there wouldnt be any actual electrical components on these pcbs
really?
itll be high temp safe, easy to design and make and the grant makes it cheap
instead i design some pcbs and stack them and then reflow them together to make a solid stack
so i thought, why solve a mechanical problem with typically mechanical parts
high pressure mercury arc bulb (.8mm arc length with most light concentrated at a point and  9k lumens)
the other being i have no way to hold the bulb (it gets up to 140c maximum)
one being high inrush current in my cuircuit but ive got a limiter on the way
ive come to a few roadblocks
tldr, using a PVIP bulb and big lens
are you familiar with my searchlight thingy
ive come up with a mildly stupid idea
but
i still havent decided what to make
thanks
ahh okay
the air gap created by layering it + between it and the hotend wouldnt help?
i think its messing with my overhangs
can i wrap some aluminium foil around my hotend as a makeshift heat shield
Yeah any long hotend (goliath and idk anything else ottomh) and a extender would be better and use whole layer cooling instead of at the nozzle
aw man i forgot to remove all the water before exporting, my bridge looks silly now
i could strategically place them or print the trees upside down and glue in later if i was super bothered
i think the top half of the tree is the important part
just gonna leave them
<@393590894387003404> is it that much worse with supports?
idk if itd look good without trees
yup ü§£ , all the trees failed, im considering thickening them all individually or putting supprts under them
probably
the top left one inersects the neighbour model
auto placement from superslicer buggin
thats really dumb, ofc it does, but would it wear out very fast?
oh i see, does a arduino uno have persistent memory
how come, if i want it to memorize mixes after powering off surely a pot would be better
i want to set and forget unless i need a diff brightness
no so def not what i want, thanks for the help
i probably have a spare encoder lying around but i dont think its what i need really
since their position will need to correlate to a pwm value at a logarithmic scale, which would you recommend, linear pot, rotary pot, rotary encoder
are there less crap rotary encoders than pots?
its for a arduino project, so i can continuously adjust the brightness of a LED, and the temperature as im mixing two LEDs
no clue ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
i dont really know
yeah, apparently potentiometers arent great?
im looking to add a dial to a arduino project, i was told a rotary encoder was the best, does that exist in a linear format?
Yeah, a lot of them are pretty similar at the end of the day, I don't think that one has HDR tho, I'm mildly friendly with one of the popular driver designer's (thefreeman) so I'll speak to him and see what he recommends
Ooh cool
gotta fit inside the flashlight
if i did a LED driver id do it custom and just give myself a lot of room
i dont think i could design either of those tho üòÖ
and if i made id do a buck boost, or fet + buck
and thats on the larger side
you get 22mm dia, and 2cm vertical distance
i think for the most part, size limits, thermals and efficiency
from my very limited exposure, its incredibly tough
yeah that was one of my first thoughts
but if it did apply to you, what would you get?
ive seen some "pcb tesla coils" thatd be pretty cool
what would you get made with the grant?
ill probably get some DTP LED boards  made
this is a cool program
ive got a warm gtfc40, a arduino and a 12v psu. id like to put together a little box that uses 2-3 buttons to turn on the LED at ~3 discrete level and then set a timer for it to slowly dim over or to stay on until turned off.

e.g i can put it on medium to dim to off over 30m, or i can put it on low indefinitely

how should i go about making the code and bits- itd be my first project with arduino. ive got heatsinks for the LED and can power the arduino off usb or 12v + buck
Ohh cool
and a lore accurate version, he always tells us he used to be mistaken for mike Tyson when he was younger
but for now ive made a small bust of him
yeah my eventual goal is to have a action figure with magnet joints
My chemistry teacher, I'm trying to print a statue of him, this first scan I missed the back  of his head so it's a bit rubbisb
How'd you do it
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
like that
if i have a mesh like this, how can i close it by creating a block along the back?

Heathrow sign light quality
Might add extra LEDs cause it's not super bright
And now the sign has light again
The dehumidifier had a rusted motor that was seized so I replaced it
Fixed his dehumidifier and got the sign lit up

Looks like I can just solder up 3 wires and have it working in a jiffy

would this be suitable to add to my power supply for the UHP bulb ballast
But not enough to justify 3k and PPE
It'd be really useful for a couple of thints
I kinda want to get one now
both are in my price range, but if theres other better options im open to that
around 50-70 gbp

which of these would you guys reccomend i buy
Do they sell thick insulated 16-18 guage
I'm starting to think I need better insulated wires on the output
That's why I made the diagram and am getting actual help with it
Doing my best üëçüëç
But it looks like it takes rectified and smoothed AC same as I'm doing
He has a couple videos going through it
Kinda, it's pretty much what I've built tho
Yeah, I gotta supply a UHP bulb ballast with 340vdc
Having researched some more, I think best I can do it's buy one of those PTC inrush current limiter thingies and stick it in series to the AC input
So presumably I'd need a 1A 240V AC inrush current limiter (average power of 180W plus safety factor)
From another server I've been told 160A peak worst case scenario
forgot to copy the graph but it said 40A peak? ive probably run it wrong tho icl
the top one are separate, the 2nd is them splitting up into multiple paths? or are they both showing separate lines
oh thats so smart
ohh you mean to show they are separate lines you make a arched bridge shape
oh do i not need the full symbol? and wouldnt it still eventually intersect like that
<@286949943632068609> sorry it took so long to get this drawn
i dont *think * ive missed anything
ah okay
do i do it like this?
how do i draw this full bridge rectifier symbol without having a line intersect?
it beats using paint
thanks for the reccomendation, ive saved it for later ‚ù§Ô∏è
i was about to say what about my project where i dont have a PCB but thats really stupid. i do have one i just didnt design it
Or is that something that only really comes into play when looking for help and working in teams
Do you make them even for small personal projects
It looks useful to design pcbs, but I don't really get the point of diagrams
ill make them super clear
hey ive got kicad downloaded and im starting to learn it, would it be okay if i stick with hand drawn diagrams for now?
What makes it nicer?
I'm currently away from my pc but around 7 hours from now I can put together a schematic and all the resources I've been referencing
I bought it from AliExpress, its meant to be connected to a MCU thing that tells it to power on via uart but apparently bridging the output of two optocoplers will force it on anyways
I can show a wiring diagram but I'm not all too knowledgeable about the ballast
Of the ballast too or just rectifier?
So I had tried to but surely if I check if there's continuity from live to neutral on my rectifier circuit I'd see fairly low resistance since it's a capacitor and diode in parallel that I'd be measuring the resistance of?
If I make a list of what's dangerous would you take a look
I meant that as in I might've missed something, from a outside view what's dangerous
And is it something I can solve by buying some PPE or is it something I need to do different
I think I know the dangers, I agree on the second point tho. I've protected myself from any electrocution and UV. Which parts were dangerous?
I can buy one with a dead bulb and use it's PSU to power my ballast
It seems like the danger of a UHP comes from the DC supply I need, would using the supply from a old UHP projector be safer
The Uhp bulbs run about 50v normal operating voltage
The ones I've looked at are the same as Uhp bulbs, around 5kv but it's for a fraction of a second (still enough to die tho)
To run the UHP I need 340vdc, otherwise I'd go for a HID bulb and run it off 12v
Ah you mean not use a UHP and completely change
I have a lead acid and inverter I can use
And then rectify it?
Dang Amazon doesn't sell those do they üòî
I can take a break on the project and go learn, what sort of things do I need to learn first before working on it more?
I've pretty much taken the electronics from a projector and set them up with a big lense
It's a ceramic tile
This is the same one project that I've been doing for a while. But yeah I know a lot of it is lethal
If you Google "320W uhp searchlight taschenlampe forum" you can see what I'm trying to emulate
I'm trying to create a UHP searchlight
I ended up going to bed, but if I come back with proper documentation os this something I can actually do
Apparently it outputs up to 5kv to strike a arc
I'll take it
Honestly it terrifys me so if anyone can offer some actual advice I can act on to make it safer
I stand well back
This is how I was trying to test the whole circuit
Feel free to criticise/roast etc
Only found that out from a friend's dad
But I didn't know you were meant to use spade connectors
E.g it felt wrong soldering to that switch
Smart enough to know it's not right but not enough to do it right
I think I'm really aware of what I'm doing wrong but don't know how to not do it wrong yk
Should clarify
Not bloody gore
Safety gore
Do you guys wanna see some gore
The only thing that might be wrong is the optocopplers on the ballast, I was told to short one of them to tell the ballast to turn on
I'm very certain I've wired everything correctly
I'm doing my best bruh!
i was kinda safe, i used a extension cord and stood behind a glass door to power it on and waited 10m before touching it

how can i model this kind of geometry in onshape, i have a large ring i need to split into parts, i want to cut it to have a top and bottom section and then use a screw through them
i could figure hat out probably

i could get a different LED tho
idk my LED's voltage is the same as my supply
tbh not sure, i just need a way to connect a LED to a PSU and change its current on the fly for use as a worklight - no size constraint
i think so
if i have a high power 12v COB LED and a 600W 12v psu, how can i limit and adjust the current to change the brightness, i know flashlights use constant current drivers, is that something that exists without lowing the voltage and for high currents (and lets me adjust brightness during use)
it doesnt spin though

I suppose but this thing is meant to be low power and stay cool
Definitely over 50c
Hum my dfplayer pro has killed itself, it plays music but it gets insanely hot to touch

its fine as is tbh since the hole will be hand drilled according to the brackets position, so its no biggie but id rather have it done right
yeah
i need the hole to be centred through the extrusion and be in the center of the bracket
this is the final geometry i want

Okay finished probing every wire on the cr10s pros ribbon cable so I can still use the ribbon cable on a mellow super 5
Safe to assume that's a ground
I'm trying to figure out a pinout on a ribbon cable
There's a few square pads that all have continuity to one wire
wurkkos wk40, its got red, green and blue and white LEDs, controlled via a rotary ring
huh, didnt realise it wasnt as big a thing to give gifts over there
bought myself a new flashlight tho üòé
im not <@592032818364809217>  but yeah, no gifts either
No more toys
For Christmas
Does a inductive probe fall under "high voltage sensor interface"
Oh dear
Ty ‚ù§Ô∏è
I'm finally upgrading my cr10s pro s
The mellow super 5
Ah okay
Of pc5, g and 5V which two pins do I connect a thermistor to
maybe if i ask politely
üò≠
i wonder if oozenest does bulk discounts
imma need to take more shifts
like at the very front at the top? i figured i leave it open for using table clamps and shiz
4040
womp womp
to help reduce cost
does it make sense to replace this extrusions with plain square aluminium tubes
im not set on any one certain design
should i redesign for 3030
ah calm
ill just use a nut on the inside of the tube and pre install them before i attatch it to the leg
im no welder
just gonna use 90 degree brackets
imma try replace a lot of these with square alum tubing
save on cost
ill do those bottom peices in aluminium square tubes
okay fair
is 2020 that weak?
gonna bankrupt me with extrusions
guh
its gonna screw together
the countertop is solid granite, its gonna add a lot of rigidity on its own no?
1 single cross beam
thats gonna be a cramped desk
or just a single cross beam
like the exact same geometry but transformed downwards?
joints?
<@159774913631223809> opinions?
okay had dinner finished cad
Haha that's fair
Oh fair, do you do frame design usually at all?
While I'm here, when I first drew the frame all the ends overlapped the adjacent extrusions so I manually shorted each side of my construction lines by 1cm, is there a better way to do it
There's so many neat features
Oh cool!
That would've saved a lot of time sorting out the legs üòÇ
Ooh how
this is my first time using onshape
yup trying to figoure out now to create a drawing in between the legs
But I'll add it later
Might do a top ring of square tube that isn't structural to mount LEDs to
I've got 10m or so of spare square tubes I think
This table is gonna be sick
Thanks man üôè
I only need 2020 for the legs and stuff for mounting
Maybe I'll use square tubing for some sections
Man this is gonna be pricey
So by ties like a short single length between 2 parallel beams that's in a stepped shape across the whole length
And between the legs, would a single bar at half height parallel to the floor going all the way around be good
Or is that 3 paralel including the front and back beam
Oh so a 3x parallel not just one
would i be better off replacing the three cross beams with a single parralel beam
this is the frame imma build from 2020 to support a 1x0.65x0.03 meter granite worktop
just coming here for some general opinions
hm, wouldnt be able to use it on a pc then
am i too dumb to use it
is it a non standard connector?
but i cant find any way to connect it to a computer
this is it
hey i found a spare screen lying about
Might just use a iPhone rho
Reached out to a couple other places
No no like shut down
ah they closed
thnaks for the tip
ooh yeah
im sure one has lidar, any clue whats a good app to use
if i cant get a 3d scanner, i do have acess to some newer apple tech
I'll use that luma labs thingy to make a promo vid tho
Im tryna make a action figure of my teacher
Yeah it's gotta be printable
What's good for people then
Okay
Huh
Really
Open to DIY
I need one for a project, and if I can get a few people to pay for scans I'll be able to pay it off and eventually upgrade, but IDK what's the best entry level scanner
Are the revopoint scanners still best deal for a handheld person-scale 3d scanner
cant find anything on RS components
im trying to find a suitable spade connector (female), my terminal (male) measures 3x0.7mm
is there a standard size close to that or shuld i be able to find a exact fit
rip
but
its not mission critical
yeah
i guessed wrong
the original input pads for power (its a AC to 12v dc adapter) tore off and i hadf to roughly guess where to put the new input wires
Whoops
would a drawing help
so pretty much, if my part measures exactly 10mm in dia, what should i put in the cad if i use their medium tolerance
so i want to be sure it works right
its my first time designing something that i cant easily make a second of
because of their tolerances
okay, should i oversize my parts?
sorry if thats too vague, lmk if anything needs clarification
my important feature is a internal hole, a 51mm od bulb will be glued into one hole, a 400mm lens will be held down with screwed in rectangular things
im new to everything cnc metal
my part doesnt need tight tolerances at all, i just need to make sure i design my parts correctly
what do i select for tolerance
hiya, when ordering on jlcpcb
And broke-ness
Pain
My iron tip is glowing üíÄ
Link?
speechless
just watched his revo roto review
god thomas sandal is dense
and the one thaat never has continuity should get the nuetral wire]
the two pins with continuity when the switch is closed should have the live
could someone help me double check im wiring a lighted AC switch right
the top few would be "rhythm kitchen" or "cats dogs and rats" or "missing targets"
yup
yuh
according to spotistats im #7 globally
top 0.005% for rare americans üòé
hey <@192355339721506816> the plugs are spot on, idk how to crimp tho <:KEKW:987119326710595604>
if theres any adhesive that fulfills both of those
i could buy 2 different adhesives
and is maybe thermally conductive
is there an adhesive that can glue metal to granite AND metal to ceramic/glass
any suggestions for a plug i could put between the psu and the bulb, its gotta carry a few kv at peak and 180W, prefferably with a screw in mechanism
a few american liquidation websites had what i was looking for
stadium
but idk where else within london i could get large lenses /lights
if i could contact all the stadiums around me id eventually end up with a powerful stage light
gotta be expensive to ship a whole lighthouse     /s
the shipping would kill me tho
haha true
in central london ü§£
id make the phattest searchlight with multiple bulbs and mount it all on wheels
a 60" fresnel has my mouth watering
i always keep an eye out for old crt/projection tvs' near me to steal the fresnel and other lenses from
true that
my other option would be a large reflex reflector which i might try DIY
but its not particularly portable
ive always wanted a carbon arc light
its also a 15,000mAh power bank with pd3.0
if i cant afford 120k lumens, may as well own a search light more intense than a tank light
üåû
had a 40k lumen torch on me yesterday when my friends calculator (solar rechargeable) died in a exam
the ballast runs on 320v dc
ive got a 12v psu too in case i want to add a secondary channel of flood lights
a similar build to mine using a 300mm lens and 80w bulb with no reflector got around 40Mcd (27km ansi range)
its going behind a 400mm lens
for a mercury arc lamp üòé
Predicted 40+Mcd
Mockup of the final PSU arrangements for my 180W PVIP bulb mega thrower
cool üëç
Yeah imma resolder and hot glur
Forgot strain relief, can I solder to any where on this pad
a fan would require a mesh and would need some proper vent holes, a pump i can just add a muffler and direct all the air at the bulb
to cool my bulb i dont have any heatsinking so airflow is the best bet, i thik a 12v air pump aimed across the reflector + bulb will be best
reckon my cheap 16awg wires will be okay for the ~60v 3A and short peaks of a few kv
realised i can spend 30m on a bus and pick it up tmrw
ü´∂
or would 16awg silicone wires work
and i need 14awg wires for it right
https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/wire-housings-plugs/8201179?gb=s
https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/wire-housings-plugs/8201175
are these two what i need? (where do i get the metal pin thingies)
oh yeah ill probably be doing less than 4A
sweet
they wont burn up? im gonna be carrying these electronics by my waist probably so i dont want them catching fire üòÖ
where would you reccomend buying them, rs components has 1 day shipping but theyre kinda expensive
fr carrying my project
TYY
do you know which the 3 pin and 4 pin is (jst vh VS jst sm)
yup youre spot on
ty so much
yeah, ive been reading his stuff but somes gone right over my head
do you know which is for in and which is for out?
ill get a pic
i thought they looked identical, but the colour is slightly different and so is the latch
yup
all ive got to do is plug my things together, short the optocoppler snd then ill have light üòé
awesome!
ill grab jst sm  and vh then, the inoput and output look slightly different]
it says wst 35
yup üòé
do you have any experience with uhp/pvip projector bulbs?
ah okay im more convinced
thank you dale ü´∂
cool
oh okay
im still sceptic, those look a lot smaller than the plugs
i was told not to direct solder wires cause it might arc
idk ü§∑  would it not arc?
i dont want to sound contrarian but the ballast outputs 180w and a few kv at startup (i think) so surely it wouldnt be the same as a fan connector
each pin is 1.1x1.1mm and roughly 2.8mm apart
It looks too wide for that, it's roughly 10mm across
One sec
If it helps, it's used in a osram PVIP ballast and in a dell ATX PSU
Could someone help me ID this plug
im pretty biased towards, can you elaborate. i havent heard those before?
whats cursed?
Guh

Hey <@592032818364809217>
Is he speaking in 3rd person üíÄ
He tried cloning klipper?
What's happened?
It's so cool meeting famous people!
I went to see after if I could find him in the airport but ig he got right on a flight
Nah at a airport lounge full of old people
A d then I was like ü§Ø
I saw a dude in a yellow coat thought it looked cool. Then saw his face and thought damn he looks like matpat. And I saw his wife and she looked like matpats wife
But
I didn't want to bother him for a photo
Omg I just saw matpat!
RAHHHH
4 new lights today
And pink LEDs are sick
LEPs hit diff on a crisp cold night
Already sold one and profited 20 quid, that covers the cost of both torches
2 customs complete
almost double what most of my friends have üíÄ
ive got 5 lessons a day
haha its just my school calendar that no one uses
still nada
i cant even see the toggle
its actually really really nice
woah new AliX UI
copper/Cu ts10 ---> cuts10
or the brass ts10 --> brats10
tits10
ti ts10
titanium - ts10
I ALSO GOT IT IN TITANIUM, THE TiTS10
It's brass üòé
Now I gotta figure out polishing it
I used a ball pein hammer to get that textured look
NEW TORCH NEW TORCH NEW TORCH
i gotta find a way to make 15- 120v
time to figure out electro anodisation
my titanium torch arrived!!
The sfy55 has a higher max current than the PSU
How come
assuming cooling and all that is good
can i direct drive this LED from a 12v 41A psu
like most
dumb question
So astrolux (banggood home brand) made it parallel
Probably, but then the torch would be more expensive to manufacture
üíÄ
If I drive all 18 LEDs to their spec sheet max (irl max is far higher) then I need 3v 218A
no one set of contacts
Or 4x18a I can't remember which is whicg
And that makes the 3x21d punch far, far above its weight class
Same for the MOSFET thing, the 3x21d 54A driver only has one of two MOSFET slots populated, so when feeding a sbt90 adding spring bypasses, thicker/more cable, a DTP board and a second MOSFET you can increase the candela from ~800kcd to 1.1mcd
Except in this case there's actual numbers backging the claims
Just wait til you hear about tint Vs AR coatings
Idk, as far as my research goes it's straight dd
but im not a EE so i dont understand the majority of this stuff
iirc the firmware for my light mixes between the regulated channel and the fet until the max ramp where it hits full fet only
ive got some "exotic" torches on the way to play with
i gotta round out my collection
ive got my eye on a cheap rotary
yeah theyre pretty neat
rotary?
if i had the source code i could tell you the exact ramp values
im 99% its directly connecting the LED to the batteries
sadly not
cause theres no pwm visible on a camera
you sure?
maybe this is a issue like levelling vs tramming
a lot of my lights have a direct drive "turbo" mode but ive never had a cell catch fire
the driver has temp regulation anyways so thats not an issue, and with the batteries in ther im current limited
i really dont think these LEDs are gonna burn up
Today after school I'll see if the MOSFETs are the issue and see what current it outputs
I gotta measure what it's actually outputting tho
Which is a solid 5A per LED
I've got 3 p45b in there so total safe estimate for current output is 90A
Spec wise I don't know what's important or not tbh, but overall higher current is important
It's 18 sfh43 LEDs which are mega current hungry and have a 3v VF iirc, so direct drive is the only way to get full performance, total output is 15400 lumens but it should be getting around 25k
So how do you spec a MOSFET, what's the important things I should match
Although I don't know how to correctly spec mosfets
The next step will be reflashing the firmware then getting either more or higher powered MOSFETs
So I've added more wires in parallel to every high current path and bypassed all the springs
SO I'm working on getting more current to all the LEDs
The flashlight really underperforms, each LED should output around 2-3k lumens but they currently only output 800
theres enough clearance
would solding one ontop of the existing ones work?
or i suppose just add more of the same in parralel
im trying to swap these out for either something that performs better
its replacing the driver in a flashlight and these are the mosfets it currently uses
hey im working on a project
If you want brightness, a couple sfh55 would do you good
üòÇ
holy hell
How do I get the screw out
I've made a mistake
Hahaha my collection costs at least ¬£500 total but my wishlist seeks to double that value
Marvelously fun, financially horrible
Also
I'm already planning a mod for it
Next one incoming tomorrow
Now I think it's available for 2 bucks from acebeam iirc
Have you seen those crazy lishen 21700 with a supposed 50-60A CDR
Yeah
But it's early days
Still less power density than some 21700 tho iirc
There's already a couple torches that use them
Yep
But for other things
Not for a screwdriver
46800 are actually looking decent tho
I haven't seen the whole context, but I wouldn't bother with a 26650, they aren't as advanced as 21700
Plus super cheap deal
It has anduril UI, RGB aux LEDs, reverse power bank capability and my first san'an LEDs
I'll get beamshots in 10 hours üòé
New torch day today!
A 4ft drops marks them pretty well
My budget, enthusiast lights dent very easily
That's what a good inspection light should do
Got that 'tism
Oopsi
I'm 16 earning 10.50 GBP as a lifeguard at leisure centre with very low expectations

Ah I snagged a kit
So it'll hopefully be done in time for the rrf in the UK and I can maybe bring it
I've just finished the gantry
My next lights will be a copper lumintop lm10, imalent sr32, lumintop gt94x or wuben a1, wurkkos ts10 copper/brass and titanium if it's released and finally a couple noctigon d1v2
Ones a half done vzbot
2 üòé
Plus legality depends on location
Most of these next ones arent useful and are more bling than anything
Barely illegal
You saving most of it?
So I'm mr money üí∞üí∞
I got a job now üòé
At most
And they only total around 1.5k
I've narrowed it down to 6 lights I'm working towards
You haven't seen my wishlist
Plus
I need my allowance man
Hold on
Woah woah woah
At least it's not drugs üòéüëâüëâ
Picking up 3 more along this trip
I'm carrying 6kg of flashlights

Yo <@409716576711999508> thanks for the guidance, I managed to get it right!
this isnt a super important part
nah its cool
ill come back to it some other time
ah well
my thingy isnt printable anyways
ah, oops
is there a way to go back and edit the radius of this outer circle, fusion has a tree thingy but i cant find that here
nah its cool, i think my designs going alright
nvm found it, its trim
how do i remove that section of the circle perimeter
googled that and got what i needed, this is my first time using cad
cheers
how do you import a photo to onshape and ensure its dimensions are 1:1  to irl
UK?
Ah cool
Does anyone here go to the university of Birmingham
the ipx4 rating is surprising
18650 maybe 3-400
If it's 21700 and a buck boost then I could believe it
18650 or 21700
That's believable
Yeah if it's a sustainable 600 for long inspections, huzzah üéâüéâüéâ
Or a EDC item
Is it a inspection light
Depends what you use it for
ah so its just inductive without probing
i think mellow is kinda doing something
dpt comments wildin
ill pick up some other stuff
ohh cool
where would be the best place to get a 1206 500 mW 3 mOhms SMD Resistor, mouser shipping is super expensive
to measure squareness what should i use, my calipers arent big enough
cool
but i gotta save enough money to buy whatever parts i need that the vz330 kit doesnt include
and for now build on glass and just be careful
ill see if i can get a square, is there a brand i should look for
nah i dont have
ohhh granite type stuff
concrete?
otherwise its like a plastic wood on our floor
i have in my bathroom
tile?
üò≠ how flat is that
how flat of a surface do i really need
oh yeah sorry, vzbot frame
but none of its flat
ive got a lot of open space
<:sadcowboy:696922729861087244>
its a plastic countertop
is glass flat anough?
or a set square
i dont have anywhere flat to build my frame
uh oh
That diagram makes more sense
Thanks üëç
I just had to double check
Ahh cool

i get why it must move quicker. but what makes it move faster
how come an object closer to the earth moves faster

yikes, ive never understood powerful laser with goggles, you cant see any of the fun
the amount of times i hit turbo on a torch and tried to shine it through my window or into my bedroom with a mirror ü§£
very momentarily
i considered it
sanwu had a 1.4W laser for $40
or at least i dont trust myself with a laser
i trust no laser
its the cheapest laser-like thing you could get
and sicne the atmosphere absorbs blue so much its got a crazy beam
yeah the blue is just a zoomie
i keep an eye out for people and cars, plus all the lights get a "how much does it hurt to blind myself" test and red scores pretty low
featured:
a red c8+ (sst20-dr 660nm)
a blue z1 (450nm)
my brother (human flesh)
Eyyyy nice üòéüòé
its all air powered?
is that a balloon on the right?
i thought maybe a a bracket that has sliding locks for a wooden board and he can place the wheel on that board
my little brother got a wheel for his xbox for a couple racing games- we share a office and i gotta find a way for him to mount it which is out of my way  (currently he sits on the floor and has a coffee table which takes up all our space. 
how can i mount a board/wheel to a desk perpendicularly thats temporary so he can put it down when hes done
Someone stole all the cardreaders at my school
can it auto run
if i download a exe will it auto run?
whos in paris

same for the eyes
20m max and i could fix the hands and arm
no work after just write a sentence and generate
thats a plain english prompt
nah but its getting close

BEAUTIFUL
I'll take a look
Thanks
Ooooh
Is that the MCU?
Ahh well I emailed support
Would it be entirely custom?
Is there a dedicated searcher
Yeah I got no results except shaft couplers
Could someone help me identify this chip it's from a keychain flashlight that id like to change the UI on (very simple changes)

Mellow has external hv 5160s that the vzbot kits have
Also that's distance between two grooves right?
What do I do with those measurements?
But it's not a standard size or pitch
I need to 3d print a nut to hold down a part
How do I measure a thread?

okay okay
Which reminds me- I gotta get my parents and brothers on this
Someone smarter than me could probably integrate tortoisetts with chatgpt and so-vits and make the ultimate assistant or recreate a loved one. The possibilitys really are massive. I can archive the voice of everyone I love and hear them whenever I want
You can give it even more data to sound better. Some proper conversational recording would be best- I was just reading a script
I finished the setup at 2am (partly why it sounds so funky) and ran it overnight
5 minutes of audio, the training process is just slow
When I'm back at the computer I'll share the Collab link, you can train locally if you want its just veeery slow (10hrs for my voice at 3600 steps)
Each model is 500mb so you can have a 20 person cast in 10gigs of data. And this is still early days of voice2voics
We approach ever nearer to customised entertainment. OpenAIs gen2 (video) + gpt4 (scripting) + so-vits (vocals)
It also offers realtime (less than a second delay on my 3060ti)
It can be ANY voice and the input can be any TTS program if wanted
That makes the model. Then I can transform any vocal track according to my model
I trained it on 5 minutes of my voice
Sorry it was unclear
it also allows for real time voice2voice
lmk if theres anyone in particular
i might make a joe biden model next
with the magic of voice 2 voice AI you can hear me sing the boys a liar
and this is all i got
i should see directories like this 
nah im lost again
ty
oh good
of the same file
will it install duplicates?
ooh
what does it install to?
i managed to get it working (dont ask how)
am i missing something
and im not seeing any new folders being createdd after running all the commands
trying to install this
could someone lend me a hand with anaconda
at least 1/3 got it, ive spent too long staring at it and typing prompts i cant see anything buy cavill
if it does at all
mb, shoulda said- what actor does it resemble
guess who it is under the mask
doing a small commission for someone
english is not lookin good- but ill see what i can sort out
same
eyyy
cool cool
Got triple 9s for science tho
Managed to fail JE
I'm all set for those, English and JE are killin me tho üòÇ

Or a particularly prestigious school?
Grammar school?
Oooooh noo
i get the point but im only trying to use it to get ahead before finals
but yes
except my school is behind on every subject
funky
cause i feel like im really far behind
<@409716576711999508> what unit are you up to in all your subjects
but ill have to drop it ig
using it alongisde textbooks for revision
im still on waves introduction üíÄ 
just learning ahead
<:agony:672200212252590089> yikes
tried chatgpt'ing it after i did it and got it wrong

Do you know the lens setup inside a LEP, that's what I'm trying to recreate
Too wide of a beam, Im hoping for 3km range
More like LEP
I'm not talking zoomie levels
And how do I pick two suitable lenses (doesn't need to be perfect, as long as I can get a tight beam)
But what's the second lens called
And then a larger second lens at the first lenses focal length to project to infinity and beyond
I assume I'd need one double convex right up close to the light source
What kinda lens setup would I need to get a small light source to focus to a beam like this
that came out before i was able to tie my own shoes, and ive just never gotten around to playing
First show I cried over
And so sad
No ep8 spoilers, but every episode is too tense
It's such a tough watch
Ouf the last of us
no clue if its actually any good, but its fine for what ive used it in
got 10m of this sat in my drawer
Oh really? How come?
Idk if they're out yet but the super power ones vez was showing off are a solid upgrade
Nah it's a smartphone flir
In other news I look hot in infrared
Figured I'd double check here
One video has a slider on the app but it looks like it was removed
Already tried all I see is a autocalibrate button but that's not doing anything I can see
Beggars can't be choosers I spose
Huh alright, it's terribly off at every length üíÄ
When I cover the flir 2nd cam it loses the augmented stuff
Cause when I cover the phone cam nothing changes
You sure
How do you adjust it?
But the image alignment is funky
Got a flir one ü•≥ü•≥
That's cool
Ohhh so not as a replacement for your mobo but as a peripheral
What's good about having ported a esp32? I'm new to all this
time to get to work
ive got 4 spare acc
1 per custoemr üíÄ
just chcuk some in the box
thermite is a slow burner isnt it
im between this, the t3 TI and ts10
fireflylite is just so sexy
could have outfit matched torches
i wish i were rich
the firefly e07x is so pretty too
id be happy edc'ing a sc31 pro. but only if i could find a ti battery tube
ü•µ  but waaaayyy out of my budget
especially if its something im gonna keep in a pocket
the 35 is from convoy which has been rock solid for me
but yeah if i had the money id be spendibng on name brand
im okay with the ts10's quality and reliability, i just wish it had a TI option. im pretty much thirstin for TI but ts10 size
i may settle on the absolute cheapest smol TI light and a ts10
ah cool cool, im trying to narrow my options for a new proper EDC
the ¬£35 is 97mm tall
üíÄ
forgot to say, nothings to scale
help me pick a new light. the ¬£35 torch is probably best in terms of light quality, although this new troch is mainly meant to be pretty
i might buy 
but does anyone have experience heat tinting Titanium EDC items
idk if this is the right spot to ask
Yikes
We've started Romeo and Juliet yesterday üòÅ
Maths is the only one finished <@409716576711999508>
English?
Ohhh noo
how far along are you in all your subjects
lordy
6 lessons per topic
shes awful üíÄ  20 lessons left and next lesson we're starting the waves topic
yeah im suffering through th waves and electromagnetism and astrophysics section (my teacher hasnt started the yet)
im confused
we came to a mutual agreemen
i think hes pulling my leg
yeah playing online
whats my next move
The tint ramping is kinda meh tho
I'm liking the s21e from convoy
Ah yeah I'm still looking for the one
Mb
Ohh shizle it's imalent not acebeam
120k lumens
32 xhp50
<@371368050802556929>  have you seen the sr32
It could be a loose cable <:thinksmart:665708349035249705>
But I'm not 100% sure
Yeah I'm thinking the 8mm steel bed plate and steel heater sheet and steel carriage might be an issue
Not my cr10 with a lump spanning 50hz üòîüòî
awesome, thanks for the explanation
so 1e8 is better than 1e2? and a density of 9 is better than 3?
ohh i see, got that mixed up
hobbing mostly, was that not around for libra ~4 months ago?
not even libra or sherpa or vzhextrudort
im annoyed he didnt try any spiral gears
nah i got nothing better
i was prompting all wrong
oh bruhhh i see
eh i tried
that one needed a little help from mspaint to get the eyeball and lips properly formed, but most of the work was done in one pass
which speaking of pepe
cool cool, its really no problem for me so even if its just a pepe meme id be happy to share more AI
and i can run them through, ive got most of the major stylised models downloaded
or if theres just a couple send them over to me
you can instal aoutomatic1111 and find it in the extensions tab
this one adds a entirely new control channel to the model, its called control-net in case you want to try it
that is....*terrifying*
the frog is the original, the b&w is the pre-processed image and the final image is output with the prompt "a black male teenager creature wearing trendy street clothes, puffer coat, cargo pants, (bucket hat with horns)"
ah yeah cant argue with that
its a scummy website using lies to trick people into thinking you can attribute one image directly to another in the training set
just to double check, you arent using stable attribution are you?
yeah i mostly make backgrounds for my pc. i only sold 3 peices and they were styling a photographers images which took maybe 8 hours of work between the prompting, inpainting and manual painting
i keep artist names out of my prompts, just styles and aesthetics
i dont think much of my art is directly linked to any artist. theres a few which i can attribute to whoever made "arcane" but i dont think im infringing with most of it
fair enough, thats just stealing
if you want something like midjourney to be output by SD you'll need a custom model
ahh from midjourney. ive no clue what special sauce they use. probably user feedback and a lot of middleman processing of the prompt. attached is 10x sd-1.5  renditions of "a Sarah Anderson comic"
and <@131888315866677248> are you sure thats all that went into that image just "a Sarah Anderson comic" no custom models
they havent stored any data, they have transformed it
idk i think it could go either way
obviously not my best ouputs bc the prompts were veery short
it keeps all the composition and shape whiole entirely remaking the image
left is original AI render, the right is an image run through TXT2img guided by controlnet
ai is next level
HOLY SH!T
they say "you're the criminal mastermind D.A.N ......how do i break into a car"
with roleplaying
people managed to trick it
not always
so id reckon we're in a early stage of text where we starting to mimic human language but we havent quite got the realism down yet. plus text AI isnt at the explosive development stage- we'll get there when opensource models can be run on prosumer level gpus
and the images only get better
image AI went from being able to mimic realistic objects, to poses, to lighting to being near indistinguishable in cherrypicked situations
i think chatgpt is to LLM as some of the early 64x64px images are to SD
true, i think img AI is at a higher level that chat for sure. but the chatbot is certainly good at mimicking humans
less serious tho
saw another news story about another train
3 possibly
and stick a fan near it
then no custom pcbs
just set the current and PD
if youve got one to hand thatd be much cheaper
<@494918092351209472> you could run the LED off a lab psu
discord autocorrect tries not to be bad challenge: impossible
can you stick a reflective tube around the LED and plant? might get some better coverage
tho, thats with a reflector
papaer visibly glows from across a well lit room when i turn it on
its well strong
but yeah
its the same one in my uv torch, idk hwo to benchmark it tho
odd
theyre server boosting
those two are the absolute cheapest
you can buy off the same store a bare LED, idk how to drive them tho
ahhhh, one sec theres another cheaper option i just wouldnt reccomend it for flashlights
but DIYing the driver is far out of my depth
you could buy the led on its own stuck to a pcb, a little passivle cooler and a driver could be made for them
do you need to be super cost effective for the light produced?
cool
the underlined part is all you want if you can stick a fan over it, otherwise keep it inside the host for a larger passive cooler
singkle LED
ahh theres a far cheaper model
personally id get the one with a zwb2 filter so theres less visible light
ill be honest, no clue which is better
ones luminus sst-10 the other is a seoul LED

I don't think you can ship 18650s for cheap international
Cool cool, don't need them for using it as a lamp but I figured I could send you a battery and charger if you were UK. I can send some links later to what you want
And do you have a 18650 charger
<@494918092351209472> are you UK?
Then use a lower output mode if it's too much UV
I'd go for a triple s12+ zwb2 filter and a 8x7135 if they offer it
Plants florescent red under it usually
The output from my single UV puts out quite a bit of heat
Do you know what kinda output you need?
There's a couple Versions, varying with and without zwb2 filter and with the nichia LED or a knockoff
There's also the triple s12 for a little more
I've got the exact light I'm talking about already, so when I'm back I can send some pics
they come with zwb2 filters as well soif you want less visible light you can u8se that
it has thermal regulation built in too
i dont know much abut lamps, but the s2+ wth a uv LED should be plenty and you can just direct wire 4v to it without the battery tube

the son left for college
its some dudes father that sold it
the hotends worth more than the two printers

the council estates got better internet
my rods the only one nearby without fibre]

i at least quite like their free SSD
how come?
free microcenter shit <:chefkiss:643937705910337536>

oop
might be able to get the original cad tho instead of STLs
ill be honest, im in tinkercad rn- no matter where i start from its a struggle
if anyone could even just describe or draw on paint what to do id greatly appreciate it
the yellow shows the mgn12h hole spacing, im having issues imagining what to edit or add to get the 12h block to fit
but the x gantry has me stuck
partway through editing 
Idk why
The rest is burned
One part came out good
Dang
i wish i could afford a ti light
yeahh
but no longer have it <:sadcowboy:696922729861087244>
wouldve tried it on my old troch cause it had stainless
idk if i wanna risk it
the machining and laser engraving on my torch's bezel is so pretty
its a colour for sure, but very dark
im 50/50 on it
just finished on the nozzle
thats carbon steel no?
Tryna recreate this 
RIP nozzle
Only have one other known stainless item
Wanted to test heat colouring some stainless steel
higher
as in higher or lower?
who're you chatting with <@360951389364551682>
literally talked to vez about this yesterday lmao üòÜ
In the context of stepper motor control, TOFF determines the duration of the off-time between two pulses of current applied to the winding. The off-time is used to reduce the magnetic field in the winding and allow the rotor to move to the next step. A longer TOFF value will result in a longer off-time and a slower motor speed, while a shorter TOFF value will result in a shorter off-time and a higher motor speed.

The value of TOFF is typically controlled by the stepper motor driver, and it can be adjusted to fine-tune the performance of the motor. For example, you may need to increase the value of TOFF to reduce the motor's speed, or decrease the value of TOFF to increase the motor's speed.

The specific method for adjusting TOFF will depend on the stepper motor driver you are using. Consult the datasheet for the driver you are using for more information.
chatgpt again
i agree on what chm=1 means , not sure about TOFF
The statement you quoted is referring to a specific feature in the TMC5160 driver called "High Velocity Mode". This mode is designed to allow the motor to achieve higher velocities by adjusting certain parameters in the driver.

When the High Velocity Mode is enabled, the driver switches to a fast decay mode (chm=1 and fd=0), which allows the current to the motor to decay more quickly, increasing the velocity of the motor. Additionally, when the High Velocity Mode is enabled, the TOFF setting is automatically doubled. The TOFF setting determines the duration of the chopper blanking time, during which the driver switches off the current to the motor. By doubling the TOFF setting, the chopper frequency is reduced, which can help to avoid overloading the motor.

It's important to note that using High Velocity Mode can also have some negative effects on the motor, such as reducing the resolution and accuracy of the motor, and increasing the heat generated by the motor. Additionally, be sure to consult the datasheet for the specific driver you are using for more information on the High Velocity Mode feature and how to use it, as well as any safety or reliability concerns to keep in mind.

theres a few id disagree with from there
https://github.com/EmpireMediaScience/A1111-Web-UI-Installer
https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui

i prefer the manual install but theres nothing wrong going for the auto installer <@204642074732134400>
It's on github
Google automatic1111 stable diffusion
Am still in bed sorry
Yup
The auto1111 version requires 8gb of memory
Then through there a extension installer which will get you ip2p easily
There's an auto installer for auto if you're struggling

how much more of the image?
ah cool cool
Plus hand captioning 30 images takes roughly 15 minutes to do well
I haven't read the full paper but unless they're doing a entirely new model they won't need many images
There's definitely models out there that work
Also <@204642074732134400> you'll want to use protogen photoreal and outpainting MK2 to get the rest of the image

bloody hell, i think im an idiot
then i just set it to spin until a endstop triggers
endstops and a dc motor
wait wait
okay, so stepper/ digital servo and a lot of "if"
this is just for a small shed, if its too warm window opens, the cold doesnt matter
stepper motor more sensible?
is the pwm value you send them not 0-255
and then a whole lot of "if"
so i just choose a number of steps and equate that to x/255
ah and because id use a servo, their range is 0-255 iirc
over xyz== open     under xyz == closed
i suppose fully open or closed it much moer simple
yeah i guess just hang it to the roof, but how would you control when it opens and closes? does it make sense to do fully open or fully closed OR as a range
i think mechanically its fine, but how do i add temperature control? (just in theory no need for specific examples)
reckon a servo could be used to open a window according to temp using a spool of wire? servo on the left, window to the right, the wire goes over a roller on top of the roof to give it a better angle to get at the window
huge really
i mean im practiclly out of pocket space with all these
well over average even
actually i think its plenty large

it was for this ^
im practicing for an upcoming exam, this is my answer to q3 (just one of 3 solutions) 
nah its all good, just wanted to check its theoretically possible
or do you need a ramps or alike?
could a stepper driver be connected directly to a raspi for simple control

yeah i love my convoys, i wanted a x75 but it turns out cause the 4x lumens == 2x brightness, the x75 is only twice as bright as my nightwatch for almost 4 times the price

and the batteries are only 14 quid
and its side switch. all my throwers are tal switch which i despise
buck boost driver
4k lumens max
lordy its a side switch
mb
and so goood
its so cheap
i need this
brooo
dang that looks sick
nah dont worry, im just remaking it, it doesnt need to be super accurate so imma get the shape done in meshmixer
a cosplay set, they look like broaches?
this summer ill have to
yeh üò≠
ive been putting it off for a while
eugh
yeah thats probably only way to do it
from scratch partially
ive got it installed, will it do it?
i know
i use tinkercad
oh the shame
wanna make something like the rider rx
for a flashlight
nah its a STL
preferably meshmixer but i could suffer through something else
yee
how do i take a hollow tube in cad and make it solid, it not a regular shape
im getting tired of online converters
is there an easier way to turn images into a video then add music with it
thanks <@393590894387003404> for the music
2 minute render time, 5 minutes to take images-->mp4 +audio
im starting to get the hang of this
fucken hell, people are so good at this stuff
where they just keep zooming in and in and in
ooh those "scale of the universe" videos
slightly edited my settings, better or worse?
lmk if youve got a good audio to use, something with heavy drum or bass without a lot of background noise ideally
my first try at audio->image  using AI
look this has to ||end || at some point
its cool
if cbons making it
and now its the ||end||
its hot topic
Here he's whispering and wide eyed and all kooky
Other videos I thought jaded and misguided at mkst
First vid I thought he was properly funky up there
I watchdd
If I ever build its gonna be a multi emitter LEP, or there's this 4km thrower from budget light forum I'd love to recreate
So better for throw
Yeah I'd imagine the 70.3 is quite smalle
I think a single does 6k maximum
üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è
519a have ruined me
I don't think I'd live with the tint tho
I've been thinking of building one for a while
Dang 200 is pretty far for a cob, was it particularly bright
You wouldn't happen to have a lux meter
Damn that's nice
if you go for a v2, the xhp70.3 are crazy bright and if you're looking for a driver convoy flashlight store on AliExpress has some really good ones
also you thought about getting a TIR or reflector for it
nice nice, any clue what kinda lumens
i can always try it out
not bad, whats the LED and power like
in a random field
torch in hand
im thinking, printer on the floor next to me
if i do, i gotta get a really good pfp
They're sick and tired of my torches I think üíÄ
The first is probably best out of them all
Possibly, tho I might get a lot of shit from people at school
30 thousand lumens
unfortunately the photos dont do it justice, but i didnt use nightmode ever
new torch
new torch, havent charged it yet so its not peak brightness. but i didnt use nightmode for the first pic so its pretty good
i got all the cool lights
hmu
if you need torch reccomendations
NOOO
sending this to your employer now, smh my head
careers over
alright pack it up <@451709396280410132>
am i too young, whats "/me"  üò≠
i beg my family dont see this, otherwise im gonna have to explain why my printer isnt *that * good
just wanted to share my image creationprocess, from first txt2img output to final outpainted then inpainted image
since theyd just be software locked
ohh are the older cameras more expensive?
maybe
iirc the old models could be hacked or something to have a higher resolution?
wasnt sure if the "constant pulses" made sense
ah cool
but how do i word that clearly
cheap 14 quid for esc+motor
yeah it just means no requirement for a complex controller
a stepper motor works fine enough but a dc motor is beter cause it doesnt need a driver
its for a spooling machine
how do i better word this
The stepper motor used would be more appropriately suited to something requiring precise control, not continuous rotation. Something such as a brushed or brushless DC motor would be better suited as it offers speed control by simply supplying a power source and setting its speed rather than requiring the constant pulses needed by a stepper motor.
How olds the kid <@204642074732134400>
And if you get a s2+ I'd recommend grabbing a white light head for it too so you can switch between uv and normal (assuming you haven't had a proper high power torch before)
Whatever you get make sure it's got a zwb2 filter
Or the s12 triple LED is good
What actual varner said. The convoy S2+ I got the one with a zwb2 UV filter (looks like black glass) and the highest current driver
UV is just so interesting
Sorry for so many
Some UV pics for you viewing disgust
my xbox controller ü§¢
plus not good for skin
mines UVA i dont think blood flouresces under UVA
though my filament drawer is lit. some blues turn red and wood goes green and oranges fluoresce
and plants glow red
so many odd splats on walls
so much dust
portable horror
my life will never be the same
my uv torch arrived
and its a false positive
these are the only threat
is all good
Doing a full scan just to be safe
All right, I didn't do it in the end but all's well?
Video driver
Sorry wait wait. Doing a full driver install
I can show you the more details tab
What it does? No
Been having some funny issues with the pc. Gotta double check this
Yes? No?
ASAP
thank you <@286949943632068609>
do i say they have a common ground?
how do i describe a 5v fan connected to +5v and onnected to the gnd of a printer motherboard
can someone help me phrase something

this is gcode for 3d printing. can you write some gcode for me for a circle
Sure, here is some G-code that will draw a circle with a radius of 10 units:




Copy code
G1 X10 Y0
G1 X10 Y10
G1 X0 Y10
G1 X0 Y0
This G-code will move the print head to the coordinates (10, 0), then to (10, 10), then to (0, 10), and finally back to (0, 0), creating a circle with a radius of 10 units. You can adjust the radius by changing the X and Y coordinates in the G1 commands.
lemme see
Q: Why have you chosen mechanical engineering?
A: I find it satisfying to design and build mechanical systems that solve real-world problems, the process of iterating and improving on functionality and form is satisfying. I enjoy the hands-on work and the feeling of accomplishment when I see my designs come to life. I am also drawn to the versatility of mechanical engineering. Overall, I chose mechanical engineering because it offers a unique combination of creativity, problem-solving, and hands-on work that I find highly rewarding.

Q: Why do you want to be an engineer? What inspired you?
A: As a child, I gravitated to science and the search for answers. I loved learning about how the world around me worked, and I spent many nights being read non-fiction books. This passion for understanding and problem-solving is what led me to engineering. I am particularly interested in the way that engineering allows me to delve into the inner workings of everyday objects, from simple toys to complex machinery. I am excited to continue my exploration of the world through engineering.
and had it write a klipper config
and a couple other essays
i had it write my 6th form admission
hows i know what im downloading tmrw, hmmmmmmmmmm?

ah more ion. its the lithium : ion ratio <:thinksmart:665708349035249705>
last i did that they put AAs into my torch, didnt do much, just confused them
no no. i dont plan on cutting. but if someone did so sfaely. what would they see different. its all lithium isnt it?
ive gotten into such a habit of calling them all 18650s when i talk to family. otherwise they get a smidge confused
mb, 21700s
whats different
they arent any heavier than eachother, as far as my kitchen scale tells
but whats the p-hysical difference. ive got a 5000mah cell for 5A and another 45A cell (3000mah??)
no no, dont plan on it
thats what confuses me
if i were to cut one open, what would i see different inside?
is that true?
`The main difference between high-drain and high-capacity 18650 batteries is the amount of energy they are able to store. A high-capacity 18650 battery has a larger volume and therefore more space for active materials such as lithium, which allows it to store more energy than a high-drain 18650 battery. This means that a high-capacity 18650 battery will have a higher capacity rating, measured in milliamp-hours (mAh), which indicates how much energy it can store. On the other hand, a high-drain 18650 battery is designed to deliver a high amount of current, measured in milliamps (mA), for a short period of time. This makes it well-suited for applications that require high power, such as power tools or flashlights. The differences between high-drain and high-capacity 18650 batteries can also be seen in their internal construction and the materials used in their electrodes and cells. High-drain 18650 batteries may use thicker electrodes and more conductive materials to improve their performance at high current levels, while high-capacity 18650 batteries may use more advanced electrode materials and cell designs to increase their energy density.`
Nh just stable diffusion, midjourneys got better training and results
yes just digital

ye that one
why so blurr
oh ffs
one sec
nah thats how it really looks
this is 3 minutes of training +5m of pre processing
the funny defects are just where theres not enough training data
theres the full uncropped version

anyone wanna play a short game
i need vs
i have vs code

Then, use CMake to build the project: (on Windows, this must be in a developer command prompt)

instant-ngp$ cmake . -B build

am i stupid or is the guide wrong??
trying to access the developer command prompt
i have an idea
hmmm
an AI wrote the prompts for these images
ive got a chatbot AI writing prompts for the image gen AI
i have hit peak laziness of AI
Yeh they made a custom font
upscaled to 8192x8192 from 512x512
unfortunately, a lot of detail lost, since my usual upscaler LDSR isnt available rn. so i had to use one of the more general ones
original vs ultra upscaled
pleeeee
@me when thats live
also, th discrod font changed
hm, if a friend sent them after i told thm not to
is it legal to send something to someone house without consent
yeh that was a bit weird
oh yeh i see that, some are sharp ome are blurred
that is so that im not banned
wdym, the painted over text?
it seems to get cetain concepts really well, especially if you give it some context
this is siiick
havent watched (idk if its out) but i dont like the celeb voice actors
extra outpainting, then ran through the AI to clean up
now to figure out upscling
original vs AI outpainted
Icl. They have 2 rap (ISH) songs. Depends what other genres you like
My favourite it's between RA1 and songs that don't belong. Both have bangers
Gotta make sure you try at least one song from every album

you guys seen that stl generating AI
i wish ours wasnt standardised
bruh
Uhm-schtewpid-bruv
just a extra fuck you to the parents who learnt the letter system
yeh but its a U instead of f
9 8 7 6 5 4 == a+ a a- b+ b b-
it does actually translate to that
and its based of a certain %get a 9, 8, 7 etc. so its easier to improve from 4-->7 thean 7-->9
it kinda makes sense, standard across the whole uk. bottom 3 u failed, middle 3 are meh scores, top 3 are really good
lang i dont mind, creative writing carries so hard
im doing great in everything BUT quote based subjects
gcse too?
oh so arbitrary rules with no reason or rhyme?
e.g
what do you guys have to know?
we gotta know 4 books
aw lucky
yeh in english language i got a 9/9, english lit 4/9 its just a memory issue cause i dont know the quotes
and thats the general consesnsus even in the top set english classes
the papers are literal ass
in england, but everyone has to take english literature and language
you need a lot of quotes too. totals more than 100 for english alone
yup
Eng literature, Latin (Roman life), religious ed
3 need quotes

best i can do is tree fiddy
you guys are great
ah mb, read that the wrong way
makes sense to me, though im not the best judge
thanks all, none of my friends could figure it out üíÄ
which is 1000ohm, and the mark scheme agrees
ooh, so half the potential difference and again half the resistance
then v=ir again with v/i=r so 4/4
do you fnd total current with v=ir rearranged, and the resistors potential difference is 12-4. so 12/8= 4A

Hey woah woah, no need for that. I heard you say "you're a very incredibly good looking person" and that's it
But it's nice it happened once üòä
I'd have one nickel
If I had a nickel for every time someone said I was good looking
Hahaha thanks
i gets the funny light effect right
icl tho
im super happy with the glassess
the first img the horizon shifts level, 2nd image really picked up on my nose and third image theres a random bridge that disappears and a pillar
irl my skins clear, but i still have pores. dont look *that *smooth
AI generated, so theres much less skin detail, especially since the input data for the model was poorly lit and unvaried

awesome
and just to check, do i donate, or whats the money box for?

how do i run that .py file
im starting to feel a bit stupid here
what items are you guys picking for the alix sale?
i think the way its defined for gcse physics is backwards (maybe) but thanks for th explanation, make a bit more sense, the 4th deviates from the mean(truth)

OMG SO INNOVATIVE
I can help you get started if you need (not rn tho, I've got the weekend free)
Which program are you using
Yeah and there's so many viable styles, even within one model
I make drip frog he make tiddies
I show him stable diffusion and now all I get is this
Just not with shity solder
I'm sure someone who's clever checked it would work in a ideal environment
Kek
Sorry if I'm a little slow. But are you saying, the current through the inner pins is 0.5x the outer pins
Ugh
Why didn't they check inside the connector before shipping
Honestly they're better off sending a pack of lead free solder and a 15w wish soldering iron in every box and a note saying good luck
My first soldering attempts were better than that
and confusing
its a lot of braining
i dont like it
just started Algebraic Long Division <:thinkgun:665335072634699808>
sorry, meant running training itself would be easier ( i think)
that probably makes training easier, having robots and all
oh do you do a lot through the robot anyways?
being able to grip and twist objects
full finger tracking + force feedback on fingers must be important tho, no?
ah thats sick, your character is very cool
nah diy it, for ~50 for a full set iirc

is there a way to have @ everyone show up without actually @ing
i assumed he dmed first, idk
oh just asked, he was just telling nitram to disable @all
üòé
got 8 pings ina  couple seconds, RIP üíÄ
that was a mess
why maze start it?
What's everyone up to today?
he even uploads over school interet, cause they have 1gig
such a shame
he uploaded it before i could tell him not to
nothuing i could have done
i just lent him a ssd, forgot to clean it off first
ive bought all the games, mainly pirated for using some interesting mods on
and he has tons of movies
and beatsaber, blade and sorcery, boneworks
and the spiderman pc game
i added the entire spore game
theres a few i contributed üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
he stores ll his pirated and compressed movies on our schools onedrive but his nearly out of space
my friend would love it if so
ah oopsie, that went straight over my head
mb tho, no? otherwise theyd be offering to host ALOT of content
very neat
*mb not gb
Can't get it flatter tho
I managed to fix the one suuuper low corner
managed to break the AI
might just ring them up tbh
hm
ah
oh, icl i dont know much about lenses, but is there a type that adds colou instead of removing the other colour
Anyone know of a better way to filter it?
I'm thinking of getting a colour filter for it, I've heard dye based filters get overpowered very easily
You can even see the beams reflection
It's 730am, no nightmode photo used. It looks like that in person
It's so foggy, and the LEP is so intense

is there a tuning tower style thing
other than trial and error how do i find the best min layer time
cool, ive nothing to lose, ill do a test in a asec
your links dead
404?
in direct drive
its a full size nema17 üíÄ
the rattling is probably my extruder
yeah with the difference of 15k on x and 1.5k on y imma get separate limits
and is the max accel just the most i can use without roundng
should i just use what they reccomend
can someone help me with my input shaper output
large bin would do it
ive picked up sacrificial bins, insulation, cupboards etc
and how many building sites are near you
how bigs the pumpkin
id try a test peice
some of my abs smoothed great by vapour some just got shiny  and held the layers
when imaging it, it writes fine but as soon as it goes to the read stage it breaks
hm
hm, thanks for suggestion
maybe disk manager can format it
idk what else is dodgy
its gotta be my adapter
and its a nice one
dead
6th micro sd card
oh ffs
how do i go back
just updated
oh bruh
still gotta istall the screens firmware
but moonraker wont connect to klipper
i think
got it installed
alriht
cya
would startuing from clean be any easier? or do i just fumble through this
oh duh, one sec
this stuff makes my head hurt iswtg
like that
git remote add cr10spro 
brb, watching it now
sorry to ask, but how do you do that
<@218133119339986944> its the git pull command right
thank you!
and im jeiwsh. and its reeeally picked up my nose ü•≥
rip

training stable diffuison on photos of yourself is just demeaning. so far things to note, ive been called: asian, girl, large, lips, nose

anyine have a chess travel set that they could measure for me
some were just garbage
a couple of those were exactly wht i was looking for
theres a few solid frames, some shit
not great
not bad, thats with xformers enabled on a 3060ti. i wonder if a memory OC will help
shark tuna?
alright, one minute#
you got any good prompts?
letting the AI choose seeds looks better
and i guess one seed gave laptops?
i let it use a range of 2000 for the seeds
the AI gets funky
now its time to get funkee
seed travel in stable diffusion AI
Especially not ambient mode
Ugh not liking this new YouTube update
ü§®
i could make strong parts in vase mode
might try recreate that tbh 1.6mm layer height sounds sick
but i get the same issue with your model
i cant recreate that behavior on other models
may as well
whats the model? i dont think ive ever seen that
on a 3060ti
nop, rendered at 704x512 iirc
but i went through a LOT of iterations to get there
this one took 45s
so cool how easy it is to get started and customise
starting playing around with stable diffusion (automatic1111 fork)
i think thats the one im using, do you know if you can upload an image for it to start on and iterate off of
cool üëç  im hoping my 3060ti will handle it okay
thanks for the assitance
3 restarts later
its fixed its self
oh ffs
no dice
one min
i can reboot
nah same
lemme repair it
its meant to be installed
nah didnt work
cool
do i not just open the file? <@96708238866649088>
open? the only one with run in it is ''run as administrator'' which the guide says not to do
getting stable diffusion installed
ohhh, thank you!
which button do i press?
the second i get a job ill be barking up your tree
im still running on cheapo volcano nozzles off ali
maybe when i get some more ü§ë
80. oof ouch broke
nvm
so may as well buy one now
so should last forveer (ish)
tc is nearly everything abrasion resistant
<@251220159069421568> is the bozzle a long time item or is it buy now or buy never
I'll sell it then
Ah oh well
Is a 150x150 heater okay for a 235x235 bed plate?
no silly conspiracy
i think its just a joke finally
ppp...ep
He's being the filament so if he wants to risk a print failing late stage then oh well I'll do normal printing and 2 walls or one over extruded wall
At the end of the day it's up to my friend
Nah still some seam I think. The whole model fits on my bed so I am considering one biiig print with lightning infill. I'm just not sure which is better
so imma use vase mode to save weight
who am i to deny them
friends requested a 40cm tall version
just aesthetic
strength isnt a concern
or should i just cut it out
if im glueing together multiple vase mod parts does it make sense to include a bottom layer
ohh thank you you
dont thini anythings wrong
its just grayed out]
how do youuse the variable layer height in prusaslicer
It's 25mm high. Jinkies
And no innapropate connotations

<:sadcowboy:696922729861087244>
so far ive got 30 printed
all my friends have been requesting
Mmm crispy layer stacking
Nah cause faster I push it through the brighter it got and it definitely wasnt fully melted (visible die swell)
I wonder what causes it
So it's not a one off
Owh damn
Would internal stresses cause that? Less time heated? More pressure?
What's the from?
I've noticed that the harder I push my gitd filament through the nozzle the brighter it glows (directly after being pushed through)
true, itd be very fucky if it had more than a few ms of latency
as your leg moves the motor kicks in to support it
i wonder i something like a ebike would work
a lot of this goes over my head
true
ayy same, what rank are you for beatsaber (if youre ranked)
would it not be better to make it human powered only, havin a powered treadmill might get funky without being able to see it
what games do you play? everyone pushes for story games but i could never get into them
you play much?
not so much of a deep dive tech nerd for VR. but ive got 20hrs logged over the last 2 weeks

If there's air blowing over one side of the print only it might explain the split quality
<@232271799541301248> what's the cooling like
or would that be a kinda weird ask
if i took it to a club, do you think someone else could fly it for me
tried flying my plane 3x today, cant tell if im a bad pilot or if the plane is broke

thank you
is the leading edge of a proppeller the thick or thin part?
and i think theres a user mod for adding 3z and a probe for auto bed
not sure if its on the cad but vez also runs a cpap fan to the toolhead so he gets sheet cooling and direct cooling at the print head
other than for binding
accidently put him into my playlist and came back to the video to him singing to a sockpuppet
backround noise
howd we end up in this timeline
The electronics are sufficient everywhere else other than a few poor choices
Stock machine and I'm not bothered to overhaul it
Or with a fan too
With a heatsink in a large sheet metal box
For sub 100mm/s speeds
Do they need active cooling?
Do tmc 2208 run hot
maybe one of the mini ones
ill have to buy a proper spot welder then i suppose
ah alright
otherwise ill heat up the battery while trying to solder
looks like ill need a high wattage soldering iron
did some reading
oof 180 spent ona spot welder
cheers
i have a feeling this isnt the right video
oh cool, didnt know they made a pack
all i have to do is take a wire solder it across right or should i be using nickel strips
huh alright, and it wont damage them? ive got a drawer full of batteries so ive got plenty to practice with
or could i just solder it? some yt videos say its fine. some say its terrible and to avoid
im looking for a cheap spot welder, any good models out there? its to make a battery pack for rc airplanes
ohh, thatd make sense. i swear one carrier has wifi all around london
Some of the new lines have. But the Piccadilly doesn't (afaik) Piccadilly line doesn't even have air con
London underground doesn't have, but the overground does for free
Do they guarantee WiFi or something?
i heard fake xt60s can catch fire or heat up. id rather buy the real deal. is there a specific amazon store to buy from?
cuz then hed be controlled by china
does he eat food tho
or is it reverse physcology and i actually control it all?????
apparently 15mil per month is what dpt thinks]
would cutting the grill off a noisy fan help quieten it
wait wait. people in china eat food. WE eat food. are we being controlled by china to dislike design prototype test üò≥
i will never get over it
still angry that someone cheated on the round with the tacos
and vzbot works with mellow, and mellow is in china. so mellow is controlled by china. therefore china controls annex which controls voron which controls prusa which is out to get dpt. therefore china is out to get design prototype test
and the vzbot used to have a sherpa mini therefore  is controlled by annex which is controlled by voron which is controlled by prusa

but now vzbot also has a hextrudort so hevort is controlled by vzbot which is controlled by annex which is controlled by voron which is controlled by prusa
and if i use a adblocker and watch to just before halfway it has no impact on him?
smh
and hes complaining that prusa is puppeting voron
entire comment section calling him a nutjob
off his rocker
I'm using frsky. I don't know much about ariplanes but I know mine is the most barebones fewest features so I can learn to fly the most basic rig. I'm not the guy you want behind a wheel (air or ground)
simulator for sure for me, im still a crapass pilot tho. i panic and yank at the sticks and over correct
shucks
hm. maybe ill just have to get a drone + airplane
yeah i cant wait to get my hands on ardupilot. it just seems so slick. i wanna make a vtol aircraft. so i get the best of airplanes and drones. i can hover and i can have long flight times and i can glide
im hoping to get a little ü§ë  from this engineeering program. and then ill go all out fpv airplanes/drones. but for now. LoS and foamboard planes will suffice#
nah just whats in the printer rn. once i get this good ill get out my ''expensive'' filaments
i think he means, with ardupilots stabilisation and auto takeoff you could have it flying easily on your first try
PLA
yeah im gonna get ardupilot once i learn to fly actually. no assistance first. once im happy with this ill build a fpv sub 250g ardupilot plane
worst one in petg (used it to check i was getting a good solid print with no airgaps). it has a lot of flex but the smoothest surface
best propeller, sanded it for a couple minutes. it has a hole from underextrusion on one side but its very small
nah this was a hasty test, i used the motor as a support to spin the propeller on. just held it at a 90 to the ground
i think
it just holds the prop. you spin it and if it doesnt land on the same direction every time is balanced
me or rubian?
same, i just finished building my flitetest simple cub. probably wasnt the best for a first build considering its got some ''3d'' shape to it. the ft 22 looks easier to build but harder to fly. anyways. be careful when you test it and use a prop balancer first. took me 5 iterations to get mine right
otherwise tons of gap fill and funky ridges in the print
0.5 and a line width of 0.6. arachne engine gave me the best results
a smaller nozzle would fix that
my bigest issue was the walls being so thin in some spaces it underextruded and left holes
gotta get some proper cooling though before i start printing more of them
just pulled them off, sanded and cut off the little zits
yup
4 degrees pitch ( i think)
8 inch diameter
may as well pint yourself a prop and test it
mine seemed pretty well balanced for very little effort
8x4 prop, went to half power
very happy with it
just made a low pitch thrum
it didnt vibrate much at all
i was so nervous, all the online forums generally said "no, itll explode"
just 3d printed a propeller for a rc airplane
would that be stupid?
heres a graph to demonstrate his opinion on crypto and airfryers

Can I just put a ssd in instead of microsd
Hah, didn't see that at first
nah there was only 1 baterrie it was hooked up to
yeah a little bit
How come?
Nah
I think my multimeter was buggin
4.05
Turned it off and on again
Checked the batteries voltage and got 7.5üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥
Just degraded capacity
It's original cell was in working order
Idk why it wouldn't
It should do
But just wanna double check
Which is why I figured it'd work
The old bank used a 18650 too
It's for charging, it'll go into a torch afterwards
I've gotta charge a protected 21700 and my usual charger won't hold it
Would attaching a 18650 to a old power bank PCB be a bad idea
and refresh rate turned down

Here is why: the ESC takes continuous voltage from the battery and essentially chops it on and off at lightning speeds‚Ä¶. Several times per second which causes a ‚Äúdeadhead‚Äù of voltage at the ESC.  The capacitors on your ESC are there help absorb some of this.  This obviously doesn‚Äôt affect the battery at all, but with longer wires it‚Äôs causing the capacitors to work harder and not be able to be a buffer or store voltage as efficiently.  Electricity obviously travels at unthinkable speeds but just like water in a pipe if you were to deadhead it, the force of the deadhead will change depending on how long the pipe is.  

Sorry if I didn‚Äôt explain it very well but there is actually countless videos on YouTube about this where they draw diagrams and all sorts of stuff.  Literally type in ‚ÄúESC wire extension.‚Äù  I didn‚Äôt look into this until I started making long harnesses and wondered why the motor was surging.  After buying 2 motors and ESCs and still having the same problem I started doing more research.  I literally only had a 6 inch extension on the battery side and when I reduced the length it fixed my problem.
Is this true
I hit that barrier during lockdown. Took a half year break and now I'm back, but in a similar issue, so I've branched out into other hobbies, I 3d printed a headstrap for my vr, I 3d printed parts for a rc airplane 

Eventually I'll run out of things to print in those hobbies and I'll have to find more
ah well
also just to check what'd you read my name as
ah i see, could you reed the rest?
were they censored, with blue pen?

how do i choose a proppeler for a rc airplane
its a 2212 motor
before i buy a proppeller id like to test if i need ccw or cw. i cant find any suitable ones on thingiverse to 3d print. could someone help me find one
nop, just 3 wires
Tried wires both way round (didn't move middle wire ever)
Somethings wrong with my motor.
I tried another ESC and it worked fin on another bldc
I tried the 2nd bldc on the original esc and it worked
I tried the first motor on the 2nd bldc and it jitters

So it has to be a broken motor
Im not sure how to move forward
Well
There isnt
Nope
Will there be continuity to ground on the ESC wires
Yeah all shrinkwrapped
How do I check that
Throttle 100 then plug it in. It makes the jingle then beeps then I put throttle all the way down
Any chance it because the receiver wire is upside down
That just makes it shake, which is what confuses me
But it doesn't reverse when I go over 0
Well I have stick down as -100
Would calibrating the ESC help
The radio goes from -100 to 100 but there's no direction switch over 0
All via radio
It runs smoothly but in the wrong direction. I need to reverse it but when I switch the wires to reverse it, it jitters
Yeah all smooth
Wdym?
Hey I can't get my motor to spin in reverse. It's currently pushing air up ( wires crossed) but it should be pushing down so I uncross the wires and it just Wiggles like in the video
my controller says im using frysky d8 and thats all i know. my receiver is the r86 from radiomaster
well colour me confused
How's frsky fit in there?
Do'h
And that mentions D8

its not coincidence
with a rc controller

if i deleted microsoft edge files
cool. input is okay. the stick is centered. ill look at those other two
i set the protocol to frsky d8 (thats what the receiver manual asked for)
yeah this is my stuffs
but one way it requires much less stick movement to reach its max
the servo has its full range of motion both ways
nvm got it sorted
which arm do i use for my servo for a rc plane

thank you <@195286997240250368>
ah i got it, you make -2x=0.5x+10 to find where they cross. (x=-4)
then substitute  x=-4 into y=-2x to find y=8. from there the equation of the the circle is 8^2+4^2=r^2 
solve all that to get a final of 80=r^2
i have for the tangent, and part of the perpendicular bisector
wait i think mines wrong. im not sure how to find where the tangent touches the circle
so 0=-2x+c and solve for c
i find the perpendiocular bisector and find where the y intercept is 0,0 and use that to find the radius?
well, im no pro but i dont think my exam invigilator will let me whip out a full tower pc mid exam
how do i find the circle?
ive found the equation of the tangent is y=0.5x+10

üò¢
fml
i sure hope floor tile samples burn well
anyone have a good idea to use 18000cm^2 (roughly) of wood
oh, sorry. im not near there
whereabout are you?
I did not do well
Just finished my latin end of year
ive also seen people say a battery charger/ wall psu is fin to sticka wire across. but again that seems to go against what ive been told
whose right? or whats the better way to do it
others say get one of these 
hi all, im looking at building a hot wire foam cutter.  im seeing people say you can just stick a wire across the terminals of a 12v psu and bobs your uncle but that sounds wrong to me
dw got it sorted
could someone help me choose a motor for my first rc trainer fixced wing
BBC ran a story about them yesterday. They me tioned the fgc9 (I think that's what it's called) and talked about how popular it is. But completely forgot to mention that you'd still need bullets, metal parts like the barrel and springs and talked about how eassy they were to make
Congrats on winning the filament <@353867038315511808>
end of ep3 hurt so bad
This doesn't surprise me one bit
He told me how for everyones birthday his dorm inflates condoms and hangs them around
My brother is a interesting guy üòÇ
Personally I'd use the angle grinder or hand saw, since you get new tools and fix a problem
Also got a cup of jellyfish. The stinging is on my legs tho. So definitely not from direct contact
Can that water sting me
If I caught some jellyfish in my kayak (picked them out the water) and they sat in the water at the bottom of the kayak
I keep fucking with them
There's some kids playing hide and seek
I can jog for 8m if I'm late or walk for 15
Brought my lights with knowing I'd have a perfect spit to get beamshots
L21B with CULPM1
S21D with 4 219As , two photos taken b2b
interesting
yeah thats where im torn, it is scalping but money
Just found out my friend has been selling shoes for a shit ton of money ü§ë. I might try it out and purchase a k3 or vzbot. Anyone else dabbled in reselling shoes
hello??? 
other mods???
i just want to check my math on this (finding the PD)
V=0.25x (1/4x1/4)
What's that?
ill later add a proper duct
printed out a sleave to hold the batteries and a fan mount
sure in a quiet room the fan is awful with its humming but in a room with a conversation you hear nothing
you guys were right
i built the fan
one more final question, is there a standard budget starter kit
i suppose thats why prebuilt ardupilot drones arew 1k+
not for average joe
im sure its simple for a 5+ year enthusiast
yeah browsing the ardupilot docs gave me a headache
alright
options are nice though
oh boy
yeah i may as well be asking to buill a watercooled k3 with a kinemtic bed
i think my last quetsion, if i buy a simple normal fpv drone can i later replace its controller with the omnibus f4 and install ardupilot
yeah imma find a kit
alright, always sucks having to start out slow
oooo, ill head there
and while a kit would be ideal i dont think my school would be too happy with one
i suppose so, ive found a website that should take a lot of the guess work out of it 
i pity everyone who has to answer my questions. even now, im too clueless to know how to google it but know just enough to confuse myself
ah right torque and whatnot. all this braining hurts. so much to learn and so many choices
can fimware limits make it count
ah, is it higher class if its capable of high speed?
speed isnt my thing so im not too worried, im more into the autonomous part and occasionally being able to pilot myself
so threads work in  this channel? i can make one to fill with questions instead of spamming here
so i think a quadcopter is the best choice
im gonna try draft my school into ''supporting me'' aka give monies
i suppose i can just cut it from cf for a drone too. airplanes are more 3d in shape
so i thought it would be drone yes plane no
keeping it under 250g
thats the thing, airplane are just cool, and i dont want to annoy people i fly around and in my mind it seems intuitive that 1 motor is less noisy than 4. then again i can print a quadcopter, i cant print a plane
sorry <@415700464089432074> ive been reading the docs for ardupilot and have a couple questions.
are fixed wings inherently faster than quadcopters assuming equivalent hardware?
will a quadcopter be cheaper?
gotta spend me moneys
welp
spose so
do those sims support gamepads or proper transmitters strictly
*cheapest*
damn
so it looks like under 250g is a must if i ever want to fly in the uk without taking a day trip to the countryside
okay so i just find a matching receiver down the road for my build
so i can fly around broad daylight on my screen but irl its midnight and im indoors. will the beta fpv controller be useable with ardu pilot
sorry to ask again, but i can learn with any old cheap toy then spend the money for a proper build right, theres no extra skill ill need for a diy drone right
Darn child labor laws.            /S
Now I really gotta get a job
Thank you for all the help
I'll take a look around. Are there any YouTubers to look at on particular. Like a Thomas sanladerer or CNC kitcken but for RC
Cool
Alright. Just to ask, as the ender 3 is to 3d printing, the ? Is to fixed wing rc. Or is it another personal preference and it all depends kinda thing
Cool, so do you recommend I build a small rc airplane to learn with or purchase one? And once I've got that down I can move to autonomous planes
Cool, I just worry I'll build a simple drone, get the hang of flying and then it becomes obsolete.
Is it better to learn with a small palm sized drone and then move on to the ardupilot build. Can I build the ardupilot one but just fly it like a normal rc plane and once I master that mess around with ardupilot. If you're sure I can't break it by crashing I'd be much more open to flying it around a field to learn
I will 100% crash it. ardupilot flies it for me until it's high enough that I can take over and if anything goes wrong I switch back
Am I better off buying a rc plane and changing the flight controller (omnibus f4) and adding ardupilot and a camera to that?
Yeah and no one can just tell me what to get. It's all depends on a lot of different factors
I figured ardupilot will do the flying for me
Not really (let me know if this is a bit too ambitious for a first project)
I can really do any build, the main part I'm attracted to is the: low weight, ardupilot, fairly quiet
It's ambitious, but I'd love one of these 
Or pointing me towards a website/getting started guide
If anyone here is into rc planes/drones and knows a little about ardu pilot, motors, transmitters/receivers would they mind helping me
So worst case fan dies or I get longer runtimes and less air moving
Cool
Positive connected to negative and negative to positive
The fan
If I plug in the ninh batteries backwards accidentally, is that bad
Need xt60s for their high current capabilities <:thinksmart:665708349035249705>
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
We store the batteries at 0v
I took one battery from the storage bin, the other from the bag of charged batteries
I'm a monkey
Nevermind
Nah two nimh batteries. Each is 7.2v max
Do batteries have a ground reference? I'm not to sure what that means
I'm not sure why it's not working. Series means + ---> - right
I should be seeing 14v, no?
alr, fan, isnt awful just makes a clicking noise kinda
yellow + black -
yellow and black it turns out
trying it now
its been a while
possibly
found it inside a fax machine i think
trying to get a look at the pcb, i can see some writing
''dsb0924hh'' its this guy, cant find a data sheet and the pcb is hidden.
will it break if i do it wrong?
if my fan has 3 wires, yellow blue and black, its the yellow thats positive and black is negative right
damn. nice
What LED?
Any optics or is it a mule?
Doing it asap, so in 1hr or so. I just didn't want to do something stupid
Can I charge them while they're in series or will I need to separate them
Well the kit came with a charger that hasn't caught fire yet
There's are for a rc car. I don't think a fan will exceed their discharge rating
So lion cells might explodem but nimh is fine
Good thing I'll be keeping them in my backpack. Right next to my spine
Right???
And they shouldn't explode
Alright, so put two in series, connect directly to fan and when the fan stops working it's time to charge the batteries
And then powering a fan. Internet says they don't need over discharge protection when they're on their own but in series they do
So it's just connecting the two nimh batteries
They're already spot welded
Putting them in series should be easy enough and I have a spare step down converter in case I get some 12v fans
Sorry to bring it up again, but I was thinking about what I've got on hand. And I remembered the batteries from a rc car I had. Theyre 3000mah 7.2v (nimh) batteries. Can I direct wire them to a fan or do I need a balancer and other bits
When I get more money to throw around I'll build for the fun of it just because I can
I get that, I guess the appeal of having something DIY makes it harder to just buy something. I guess a weeny 5v fan will do if I really get one
i think ill go with this advice. the effort just isnt worth it i guess. thanks for the time
i dont have either, i do have a dodgy 12v supply
i dont question why its there or how its there
came from my drawer of stuffs
thats the plan
one sec
ÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩáÔΩâÔΩÉ
both are 24v
lemme take a look
the loud kind
whelp, that one is free
i get its a stupid solution but ive not got a lot of options
true, but 32 is more than the ¬£24 id spend on doing it DIY
gotta wear the uniform
cant wear a hat
and when i finish ill just toss it on my pc, ive got a drawer of spare 18650's so i may as well put themm to good use
its not awful, UK afterall, just for the week or so we'll have a heatwave id rather not boil. they keep windows open all day since covid and whatnot
id like to have it in school, so my plan is to keep the power in my backpack and have the fan +mount on my desk, hence the silent fan
id like to keep the noise below 22 ish dba
ive chosen 
has anyone built a desk fan from a pc case fan, im not sure how many cfm to aim for
eh who needs brake pads, just get one of the kids to sit in the tire well and grab the wheel to stop
i dunno
dongus
cool
i tried google but the only asnwers are about cars. is he right?
is there anywhere to watch for free?
poor matchup
idat shows up in khakis lmao
who won
did it actually?
do they know it increases their chances of cancer?
my middle adged dad comes up as ''antique white''
Rip, did a colour detector app on my skin

What else has made it worse
Idk it's still optional so doesnt bug me
Interesting, similar to threads but a nicer presentation
Then we can follow the link

i always feel bad when a a comedians humour just doesnt land with me. seeing his videos just makes me cring a little, becuase he tries hard and the videos show it but i never really get the humour
his whole schtick is being weird
ah yeah he has the ''Dad'' channel
ive got everything set to max
fun, but cursed
And they connect either to a SSD which im convinced is just a gateway to a pocket dimension full of monkeys with notepads who write down what you save or we send it to a disk that spins reeeeeeeaaally fast next to a magnet and it just works
To the point where you can walk into a store buy one with cash and then put it into a motherboard and it just runs with no tinkering or DIY'ing
True, make it a million times faster (when the inkjet had to print a 5mm circle and the 3d printer a 500x500 cube with solid fill)
*measured with two different sets of gcode/3d model and with slicer optimizations
But, what parts that are usually standard can we make completely proprietary and  copyrighted
any clue what st-pla is from cctree. mainly the st part
if i were the recruiter id hire you immediately
i dont mind it, it supports both formats and allows slightly easier cooling of the stepstick since the important bits will be exposed and not hidden under a pcb
And all printed parts
Yeah no panels either
Barebones model, assuming you use low end everything. Starting on a tronxy let's you skip upgrading the z and focus on the xy
Take something to resell and get a vzbot or alike. Vzbot base model is roughly 600 so he can get the bells and whistles too
I forgot to hot tighten
God damnit. I've spent the last month trying to find a weird underextrusion issue and find where the blobs of charted plastic are coming from

Still in secondary school, so any work experience is good experience I think. My GCSEs are next year
im in the UK, they do work experience for anyone 14+ which is great, the have a cluster of places near-ish to me in Cheltenham
Quest 1 Incase someone's had this issue with a bt home hub router before
Tryna get wifi speeds over 13mbps and it just won't happed
I hate debugging/testing in VR
ah i see, ive been struggling with wireless vr for the past few hours
pardon?
Thinking about doing work experience there
Just asking in case someone happened to work there
Anyone heard of spirax-sarco
Gotta find a proper switch tho
Welp at least I have this guy working
Time to buy some boron nitride paste. Can someone confirm that it won't solidify in storage (big tub)
RIP
Man I'm an idiot, was testing a LED and hd it resting on a COPPER heatsink. There's no electrical insulation between the two and I was thinking "huh smells of burning, what's that crackling noise". It's me shorting the batterys
Does annex count the amount of people who've built a annex brand printer
no no, im meant to take the money upstairs but im lasy so i just have it held down there
got them soldered then realised, i gotta screw this shit in
yeah thats what i just landed on
just wrap the wire around lots?
its so that i can wire the batterys in parralel
How do I solder together the two screws on each end
The bean bowl
and probably spinning the wrong way
unducted and without a proper intake
so thats neat
measured roughly 1 oz on a scale with HDD motor at half speed and this fan attached to it 
So that's what like 5 or so stls
sounds fine to me
look at writes
uh oh
true but theres 4 wire bldc that you can run off a 3 wire esc
both are brushless though no?
the esc works already for a normal bldc
welp i can live without it
how do i wire a esc to a stepper motor
for 9 GBP ill give it a 7/10
only complaint is it scrapes in one section leading to a little ''stickiness''. its metal on metal so itll probably smooth itself out after a while. (ill just add some grease)
screws are simple philips head and are easily accesible, wire stripping is consistent enough
some paint looks hand done and not very clean
after a week outisde in the delivery box theres no rust
text on casing is readable
nice plastic grips and casing
works well
aldi wire stripper review
Yeah I wanted to say something but I know they would send that clip of a heavily modded voron hitting 1000mm/s
Hopefully it piques his interest
Left a lengthy message asap in the comments
Yeah there's already masses recommending voron
I wanna see if we can get him in here and building a k3
A good one this time

Also goodwill is just like reddit says. Everything is so damn cheap. Everything is like a 1/5 of the MSRP
Got it now. Sure hope it's good
Worth buying? (PCE-MSL 1)
8 dollars
Found a decibel meter at goodwill
I only noticed it from a really bright torch so it doesn't bother me otherwise
Yeah. I know there online articles butbthey can't fully describe it
And in a round LED would it look like a ring of light of red and green and blue a little ways off the emitter
Can I have chromatic aberration in my vision
But the dropoff from there is fairly gradual
Anything over a foot I loose some detail
Weak eye muscles
Lucky. I have issues on focusing on things up close
Well that's what I thought. But I got a friend to come with and tried on every single pair til they liked one. They look good enough imo
My old pair were completely payed for by the NHS but they looked awful
Yeah similar prescription. Neat
Sure do. Can't remember if one eye is 2.25 and the other -2.25 or if both are around -2.25
When you say equalizer. Equally worse or is it an improvement
Ah I'm kidding. My prescription is because my eyes are football shaped and I don't think lasers will fix that
Maybe I should start staring into lasers
You did diy eye surgery
Wait
Kill me

/s
Darn I had just stuck the magnet to a motor and held it to my pacemaker, shucks
Lmao, I'll leave them around school and kill peoples lunch cards
Google just names various electronics, just wanted to check anything organic or other less common things
Also, what's TSAs opinion on large magnets
Quick question, I've got a big ass magnet. Is there anywhere other than electronics I shouldn't put it (obviously avoiding squishing fingers)
Honestly, I quite enjoy handing the screw drive to my little cousin and letting him loose on less delicate projects
Why not?

Oh I'm using wireless power so I just plugged the wall into the pool
Should I put them in the washing machine after swimming
This pool uses salt instead of chlorine, is that a problem

Rip overhsot temp by 20c
Rip. Okay I'll loosen the screw
Or I'm high temp
No it's stone cold to touch
Halp
But
And I didn't see it from my computer cause the printers in a different room
No no, the thermostor wasn't touching the hotend
But when I tried to heat nothing happened on the temp readout
Thermistor showed accurate temp
Rip
Don't worry, I think I just forgot to scree in the thermistor
L
Continuity check?
Not sure what couldve gone wrong
We soldered a extension to the thermistor and changed out the heater
Trying to heat up my printer but it just says heater error restart printer
Hey someone mind helping
Why what happened?
tried watching with my parents, they were thoroughly uninterested
and 6 years of work
cant wait for s2
pretty good
just finished arcane
is it all CGI or do they have physical studios/rooms to film
do you know how he makes those videos
have you guys heard of ''the backrooms'' videos from kane pixels

*today
ill be flying in large open grassy areas if that helps, ibe honeslty got no clue
what else would i need to get a working rc airplane
hi id like to build a large slow rc airplane but ive no clue where to start. ive got a box of 3000mah 7.2v nimh batteries and a ''30A SimonK Firmware Brushless ESC ''
/s
Can I hand read it
Any way to recover data from these, budget is 5 quid
huh
kek
lmao
any reason not to get this guy
all my walls are super thin, no can do
whats a good organizer or tool holder
and ill have some left over for one of those fancy strippers and maybe a organizer
14 quid for the crimper and 460pcs
is there a proper website to buy from or are they all made equal
thank you
awsome
awsome, is there a good kit of connectors to buy?
i have one for ferrules, nothing else though
hey so ive got a spare ¬£30, is there any tool or must have item to get with it
so many scams
its too funny
and man everyone looks uncomfortable and unprepared
my school got new id card photos
Maybe I'll learn proper CAD and do it faster and gooder
Not big bucks but 5x higher than minors minimum wage
Just got 30 quid for 1.5hrs work
Cheers
What makes the capacitor turn off the light
Oh bruh, duh its alternating
But why
It works
Alr, in it goes
And no polarity
It has a x2 on it
Having issues with a light staying on all the time. Manual says to install a capacitor in parallel. Can we stick the legs into the live and neutral terminals and call it a day
sometimes
it just happens
ah so the spinning maskes 0 difference
and it alll spins
yeah its just a spinning pecie and you shove a metal square into it
Found this on the way to school, what is it?
but not so far back that you wheelie
video from mark rober says opposite
wouldnt not moving either do the same
just watching a video from TOT about making a square broach, why does he spin it in the lathe and spin the peice hes working on at the same time
just a big ass pencil on wheels lmao
true, function over form. just a shame the batmobile didnt win
for this kind of race whats the trick?
damn that sucks

just modelling afaik but its a 10m print at most
tinkercad + 30m on minimum wage?  cause im a minor. ive honestly got no clue (its a one off)
¬£10 ?
its commercial, took my 20-30m while watching yt so if i focused 15m
im looking for some guidance on how much to charge for a quick 3d modeling job for a family friend. its the first time ive done a job like this, how much shoulod i ask for?
hopefully they sort it out
yeah, total BS. emailed my head of year
school sent out a wellness survey but it isnt anonymous <:onlyjoy:672200212575420453>
thats sick
well
do you mean ''or bust''
ah
pardon?
and the video quality
and the effort
and the video quality <:chefkiss:643937705910337536>
i want this guy to get sponsored, so he can make MOAR videos 
yeah i have started skipping some of his more recent videos, switched to GN for news
''jayz two cents'' and ''dawid does tech stuff '' are the only peoples ads that i actusally lsten too, otherwise i skip
and here we are discussing it when otherwise we wouldnt be
the slap though did get a lot of coverage
those award cerimonies are getting a lot more irrelevant and with the ukraine thingy going on they didnt get much on screen time
and the slap couldve been a real hit but everything else staged
i mean, they are both actors or atr least will smith is
it was probably staged
didnt know they had a command for it
thats cool
huh
but mine doesnt
the one video i saw about it showed it just lifting off
ive got a spare
a small bldc motor from a cd drive <@!195286997240250368>
i tried pulling but it wont budge
how do i get the big metal cylinder part off
I'll have to adjust my grip
Oah I see
Oh is there a better way to hold the pencil when sharpening
Flush cutters are much better than scissors imo unless you're cutting paper flush cutters make a better cut
Should I have bought the 1tb model?
Can someone help, my pencil sharpener isn't working right
and a better psu
i gotta get a servo tester and esc tho
for now im gonna leave it as a mini disc sander
shucks
am i using my hard drive right?
Cool
So how comes in ac you can let go but not dc. Is it because ac alternates so it makes your muscles spaz whereas DC is always on so it makes you lock up
Respect requires a lot knowledge. Fear requires enough knowledge to know dale is correct
Well if dale is scared I'll stay right the fuck away. That's like seeing the mandolorian running away from a fight, fuck that
Ah, well that's a solid answer
Man this stuff is confusing. I assume there's a website that has a checklist of thing to have before messing with HV
Wooden tables and carpet isn't a issue. Dunno if I want a conductor or insulator on the floor
In the walls?
Oh and last question do I need a special work area is there any does and donts for where I have it
Do you go to hospital for those or does it just hurts (usually)
Is that to stop it going through my heart
Cool and the hand thing, one hand rule or something
also what kind of safety rules do i have to follow when working with high voltage
always happy to receive more help
year 10 uk. ages 14-15
''AO is a radius so you know the length. If you know the length of the 3 sides you can find an angle (cos rule). If you know 2 sides & the included angle you can calculate the area.'' thats what my teacher says, same as you guys pretty much
thank you guys
cool, i dm'ed my teacher but forr now ill do the cos rule thingy
unfortunately cant take my pc into the gcse's

hm, im gonna skip this question
can someone help me with this question please
üò¨
Is that a big amount?
Cool, I'll leave it behind
So it's not worth buying for DC projects
The charging brick from last week
so i should put something under the tape so i can lift it later
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
ill get some carboard
ohh enclosure
cheers
what do you use for adhesion emiel
ah cool thats what i used as a starting point
how do you apply the tape and how do you remove it, also what tep do you use
ive got some fr4 but no magigoo. so painters tape is the best option
and it never came off
i tried it once on a spare mirror
tape
at high temp will it not just stick permanently
how do you guys get polypropylene filament to stick
i know about halback arrays but thats about it
and how can i strengthen a set of magnets
would i better suited making a super strong set of magnets or a strong electromagnet
poor lad
hes just realised i didnt add the account
theres thousands of other 'game's so this scam really falls apart
my steam name is ''game'' because 9 year old me was uncreative
what a monkey man
Tried it on another pair. Same strength change after removing the plate even without heating
<:k3now:856626059336089631> flux is always amazing
or just make them less strong
would it completely demagnetize them
cause they kinda feel weaker now
i see, so when i put heatshrink on these that mightve weakened them
neodynium?
well if it helps you i set mine on the printer bed at 80 for 5m and it made the glue much weaker
will that impact its strength or durability
but lost some nickel plating
got it off
any clue how to get them out
ive got the magnets out the hdd but theyre stuck to a metal plate
cause r=that'd be a pretty damn huge hammer to reach the UK from russia
do they have hammers
is it a hammer
phew, i used some disinfectant too, didnt want a virus
nah, i wish i could tho
its got holes and threads and its solid metal and the lid has a seal
and figured the case would make a solid enclosure for electrnics or something someday
wanted the magnets from it, i got the hdd for 1 quid on ebay
the chip snap wasnt on purpose i just missed a screw and figured there was some glue
kek
or cut ribbon cable
not the bent as hell spinny arm
my pc has 2tb of hdd cause i found them in a dump
when you say that it makes me think that the harddrive is permanently broken and now im worried my bitcoin wallet is gone and i had my life savings in there
yeh i just glued the other half back on
dunno why thatd help
i guess i can kick it
Is that bad
This thing fell off
Do you think it'll unbend
But I bent the arm thingy
Looking better
Just tried some windex
My hard drive was slowing down and a friend suggested I clean it. What do I use on these guys
or a florida based/ new york based version
Comprenew     anyone know of a uk company similar to this
It's a electronics case
RGB led
ill have to wait til next week, ill @ you when im back there
found one at a charity store
could a 24v 15VA wall brick adapter thingy exist or is the label lying
rockets, everywhere
someone in vzbot says its a curse, kurwa (bitch)
reverse polarity on a capacitor on a cheap board with no fuse or safetys
not sure, but it aint english
he got me into printing so i respect him for that. hes entertaining and makes videos that a random person browsing youtube would click
better look at that quick gel printer
kek
why just a photo of your hand and a table
still waiting on beattogether to update to 19.1
ill probably stay on 19.1 since my quest friends all use that
ah cool
from 19.1 to 20.0 some got broken i thought
im sure its not on purpose, but either way it doesnt matter, if you're on quest then its a bit of a pain but pc modding is ez
the custom maps are gonna be so trippy
and the fluid mapping is a nice change
the lighting is truly next level
Is the BMG really such a upgrade over dual gear extruder
Cool, so if I find the current rating I can compare properly
Oh and more torque
The lower torque one running at the rated current and the other I can't find it's rated current
If I have two steppers, one higher torque than the other and I give them the same current which will be better
Made for attaching parts where it's a awkward angle and you can't apply pressure very easy
Didn't strip a single screw or slip once
Indoors only. I just really loved having the torx but
Alr I'll take a look
If I can get the same diameter I'll just buy the 4mm diameter
I was able to buy this pack a couple years ago but it seems they are sold out everywhere
Hi, does anyone know of some good self tapping wood screws that use a torx bit
ah okay ill spray on some clear lacquer. onto every exposed edge?
would any f the options above be good enough, its a indoors project and wont be handled all too often
lemme get a pic
ikea cabinet door
i tried some pva elmers glue dissolved in water then painted on but im not sure it did much, would a spray on clear coat lacquer or acrylic spray be better
hey i was told to seal the edges of chipboard after cutting it
is the error "audio renderer issue please restart" anything to worry about or just a one of funky issue
And a rubber stopper and some oil
Just plastic under the label unfortunately
Ah, duh
It's a delta electronics fan of that helps
How do I see?
There's only black yellow and blue wires. Can I still power it from 12v directly or do I need some other hardware
this isnt for a 3d printer so the application is a little different, im just using klipper ands klipperscreen for control since im very familiar with both of them and take less effort
i was hoping to have it all hard wired and solid mounted, so a hardwire power is much less complex to use
cheers, do you know if mobile phones are okay with hardwired power instead of a battery
also i assume youd have to hardwire power oterwise a always plugged in battery would die pretty quickly
does klipperscreen work on a mobile phone?
Finally decided to mod it a little
Anyone have any must print parts for a quest 1
so i know it says for a k3 but spider and rapido are really good prizes, could i enter for that and leave the others for someone else (assuming i even win)
creality melze board btw
i get this error when trying to use hardware pwm
MCU 'mcu' shutdown: Can not use timer1 for PWM; timer1 is used for timers
ill try those all tmrw morning
cool
itll be taller than the shaft at that point
<@!412472500266467363>
cool, ill print some spares to start with for testing and try a screw but the final will be with glue
hub is fairly thick already
to clean it?
but i can print in abs or petg if neede
yeah
could i use a screw? would that work even if the plastic gives
ah alright
yeah its press fit rn, glue i can try and wdym by bigger hub
yup
how do i stop a gear from stripping off the notched part of a stepper
Filament pullstruder, makes filament from plastic bottles
Next up, mockup mounting then I'll do some adjusting and test runs and final mounts and rgb
First moves
Thx to all of you
bearings also from a 2d printer
ikr, every part came from bits i found on my commute to school (i asked before taking anything) . last year i picked up an old pc from a skip and used the psu in this project and the hdd in my pc for extra storage for stl's and other junk. the wood is from a renovation, the wires are from a (2d) printer, the motor is from a printer, the pi zero is from my school who was disposing of them, the smooth rods are from a printer
ive got the cost at 7 gbp rn becuase i lost a cable
pelletized plastic wouldve increased cost
stripped bottles
also the first ive seen made from recycled everything
not to toot my own horn here since this and a couple other communities have supported this entire project. but this is the first thing ive built myself and designed all myself
Thanks
To recycle more items
Made of only recycled items
To make filament
It's gonna be a pullstruder
Final ratio of 120 to 12
Sick
I suppose so, do you know if there's a max limit to distance moved in one command
lemme get a pic
only spins in one direction
other side it would just bump into on its second full rotation
but klipper requires it to be homed
its a gear i gotta spin indefinitely
hey anyone know how i could have a endstop but have the motor be able to spin past it
i need to be able to trigger but move past it
just a spinning motor
i first tried a flag connected via magnets but they arent strong enough
they let me hit the endstop and keep spinning but they couldnt trigger it
What's your guy's opinion on it
399 seems steep to me
eek
just for one stepper too
nah no endstops
even if it isnt
all i need now is a way to tell klipper that a stepper is homed
which means its that stepper probably
works on a different stepper
with or without a endstop plugged in
should i try other steppers
would it be short protection or something like that
any clue why my psu would shut off the second i try home my single stepper
a melzi board, a pi zero w and a atx psu
everything in there is pretty robust tho so itll be fine
part of the spectacle of my build is that you can see the electrnics, so ill box them eventually and have a glass window but ubtil then its open air
only a handful to crimp since i got this recently and theyre all open air electrnics
rather safe than melted
oh good, you can see a bit of an air gap tho
cause most of them were pretty loose
imma redo my crimps
i got it
ohh, you just gotta push really hard
like a stepper shaft
but the bolt it sits on is notched
yeah i got that out to try turn it
so it cant wiggle
except the bolt and nut thingy are notched
oh good, i need more force so i turn it to the other side
What's the wheel with teeth in for
This should work right
Ive got ground going to the top solder pad and 5.1v going to the bottom on a raspi0
like this
right
if i were to connect a raspi 0 usb data to a creality v1.1.4 usb i would just need a usb mini to micro data cable
For the input I'd rather do soldered
I'll solder some data lines on a cable to the output
I only need one
If they can be one direction only
Is the USB on a raspi 0 a output port too
Better than trying to solder to the CPU or however it is you access them
Or connect the USB mini to USB mini
Can I connect Rx tx to the USB port of a crwlaity v1.1.4
Wired power to the raspi zero
Kept touching it to the plastic
I'm a idiot
Nope nvm
But the always on fan port ground doesnt
So if I touch directly to ground it works
You guys are great
Cool
It might be a shared ground is that good or bad
One tiny issue tho, if I have a 5v fan and I want to control it from the 12v motherboard. Can I put the negative in the board and use a dedicated 5v on the positive
Pretty much a perfect fit
And a 5v raspu
It's for a 12v capable mb  and one motor
its all good]
on it goes
you know what
also ive got a spare one from apple
ill just add that if this does explode and break ill never blame anyone here, i did research and if someone else with some knowledge can confirm my research thats enough
h275p-01
I'll connect it to a switch later, for now I'm just gonna use a jumper
The bottom left has my 5v for pi and 12v for printer. The jumper is green to black to make the PSU turn on
maybe 100w maximum
id like to use it to power 3d printer electronics
would soemone mind checking my atx psu
before i release some magical smoke
And forced
But then see a black women in a beauty mag and think it's too wokr
My grandparents are fairly liberal and support the gays and women's rights
Jinkies
Yup, the rest of the neighborhood is very modern, if you wanna see a example see timbalands house it's a couple houses over
The builder is very out of touch
And my house doesn't look like that
But I live in england
And I'm no professional
And saw a English style house
Just walked through a more expensive neighborhood

Yeah, unfortunately it's either delete those messages and change what happened or leave them. I just hope everyone took it as banter and not being serious
Our regional roles give permission to @ all by accident, shouldn't happen again
What's the blocked list, is that universal or only per person
And he still plays games on it regularly
30mm bubble under the keypad
You should see my brothers gaming laptop
Oh that sucks, the bot can't cover that. Only link bombing
Hey <@286949943632068609> , saw the bot thingy. We use a bot from <@557220161346600971> called phishy, it automatically bans or timeouts the scammer and deletes messages before anyone sees them. It's worked pretty well so far in vzbot
Obviously neither is optimal, just looking for the best of the two
Ep2 white lithium grease or dry PTFE for two plastic surfaces, not high speed or pressure just want to make sure they don't melt
When you say running without battery, what did you change
Time to dig out the bag of old phones
and supports original makers
makes a cheap retractable probe with few moving parts
for once i think his latest video is actually alright
im limited by hardware already on the printer, hence the cutouts
can you guys critique my design. im a noob and this is my first designed printer mod. its a belt idler holder that gives me a lot of room to tension
I'll do some google
Alr
assuming it outputs voltage on staRTUP THATS ALL I NEED
so i can just dab solder on those two contacts
yeah, no tangles or clogs and generally very consistent in colour and thickness
yup 
incase the model number helps ---------> d495e-s0
Markings Incase they mean anything to you
lemme send a couple more photos
theres also some markings on the side, its just screws to open it up
ill get a pic
yeah just large flat copper paads
and some other small pads
its just got two large pads
vut how do i connect wires to it
voltages and all that match up
its a 500w psu and i should pull maximum 80W so power is no concern, because of the noise ill probably not make a bench psu from it
unrelated but, can you repurpose server psu for other projects
tbf when i had one brand and only one brand it made life easy since it was very consistent. keep in mind they sold it online with same day pickup for 11.50. it wasnt the prettiest filament but it definitely was better than a lot of cheap amazon brand. but i do appreciate just dolling out a little more money for the good stuff
the shit filament used to be ALDI bran mostly but they stpped making it so i just buy whatevers cheapest on amazon
i have a shelf for the crap filaments and a shelf for the fancy filaments. the finished products in projects are printed in my fancy filaments but everything else is in the shit filament
Bruuh that's what it means. They didn't even mention that. Alright thanks for the explanation
Can someone explain how to solve this
I'll have to wait til tomorrow
Thank you
Cool
Alright, so is there a guide for the bearing taking apart
Also in my defense this entire project is a first with any metal work and I've never used any of these materials before
Also if I happen to have metal bits in my hand, how would I remove them
Even with the bearing retainer think in place
So I just shove grease in
The sheilds are off
If I see it again I'll drop it here
How do I unfuck the bearing
I put the some bearings full of metal and grease into acetone and they've fully locked up
Also
Ice seen a couple photos of it on reddit
Just wanted to check before ruining the bit
Yup the bearings
Does a carbide cutter for a Dremel (cylinder shaped) require oil on the hardened steel I'm cutting (maybe stainless steel, I'm not able to test)
Not the new one tho
My first computer did this
At least it's a prebuily. So I've got a support line to contact
Guess who's computer died overnight for no reason a day before exam week
could i connect the gpio on a raspi zerow to usb for communication, since the default ender 3 board doesnt have exposed rx/tx pins i think

it only requires rx tx and 5v+- which a usb carries i think
how fix
alr, last resort
i couldnt take one from out the country, id only take from friends cause i could return it if they ever needed
yup
sucks that the cheapest pi i can find is ¬£40
otherwise ill see if friends have one
perhaps you have a point, ill get in touch with them
where do you guys find raspberry pis in stock
those are both wirless and can run klipper and controll one board
shop.pimoroni.com/products/pibow-zero-2-w
if it can drive one axis at low speed and a screen its good enough
i may just buy the lowest spec raspberry pi around
but after opening marlin and realising just how much i despise it
ive really no reason to use marlin over klipper here other than the fact i want it to be as cheap as possible
ew cultist begone ‚úùÔ∏è
i hate marlin
send help
cool, tldr: collects will fit the tool and use the bits at your own risk but they *should* be fine
also will those bits be safe to use <@!360421783863820298>
are the collets the right size?
thank you!
so these will all fit into the tool and a few can hold the cutter i linked
when it turns on it vibrates, lots
someone knocked the tool over and it landed on collet bit
nah, turns out chinesium breaks before hardened steel bits
yes
thank you, is brass okay?
im not sure about what the parts are called
what keywords do i use to search for replacement parts
i cantry provide as much info as possible but ive no clue how this works
could somne help me find a replacement collet for my rotary tool
It's a ferrex brand tool
How do I know what size or material collet to buy
For a rotary tool
Have you seen that printer inside a shipping crate. Seems pretty cool for military/whoever else
i see, thats unfortunate
are they not very good?
nearly everything on amazon is next day by 1pm and if i miss a delivery i can pick it up on a walk home from school
thank god i live near 3 post offices and 2 post boxes and 2 fulfilment centres, each from different shipping company's
just a rough estimate, im no pro
they would probably mine at least ~200 btc
at least 4 people were gonna open that
i knew it, your trying to hack me üò≤
Could I sharpen the edge to last?
trying to keep cost to the absolute minimum
just a small side project
its nothing crucdial anyways
yoinked them off already
its main job is to rotate repeatably
this bearing will run slowly with little load
just gonne wash and remove the grit in acetone and regrease
just ordered the carbide bit
but iirc some shaving cream helps reduce fog. wipe it on then rinse and it should help a little (but i only do that with my mirror)
you can wear a facemask under a facesheild to redirect the air and it helps a little
same as glasses and a facemask
inside, no. outside yes
one final question: one is rounded at the end and the other is just flat cut off. is there actually a difference
alr, i went for faceshield cause glasses and scratches should be fine
thanks for all the help
cool, im looking for some good eye pro now. any reccomendations
i dont need a vest or anything
but that *shouldnt* happen to me since im not a mill, right?
just two to grind, so this one will serve me best, when you say brittle do you mean snap in one hand or drop and it breaks
and will a cheap multipack or a few good abrasive wheels be better
cool, the carbide one isnt worth it then?
its magnetic and sparks when cut
so i dont have a file, can i try with sandpaper?
brb
fairly certain it is
it might be stainless steel
i can say it sparks during grinding
well, how can i tell
yup, screwed onto this post
currently ive got it screwed down and as the dremel spins it moves the bearing leaving a alright surface finish and a fairly even cut
yep
lemme get the half ground bearing
yup
so far ive been using ome no name grinding wheel  but its wearing very quickly
just remove the bevel and sharpen
lemme screenshot the image
be best for grinding this profile into a bearing  
or this 
would this 
Thankfully the dedend road I live in has no streetlights so it's kinda dark but not great

could i make a abs drill bit and use lots of oil?
so ne reprinting

cant
without a 8mm drill bit
anyway to drill a hole in pla thats 8mm wide
Hehehehehe
all im saying is im 100% sure the jews are to blame for me being at school. like just turn the space laser guys. destroy the school. ugh

how?
silly billy
honestly. then goes complaining in the comments abt it

complains theres a GB flag next to the english language
the best part
hes too funny
talked about building his own printer a vid ago
its am ender 3
bruh
just mash they keyboard and insert some emojis
but at least none of the family has had covid
my little brother got a fever when he had his
sheeeeeeeeeeeesh
and now russia influencing westeners and the american election
hes talking about russia and the ussr
sheesh
it mostly comes out of one side of the opening but im not sure which and dont have a psu to test with
could someone with a ender 3 4010 blower post a pic showing which side the air comes out of
I used to run 240c
nah i just had hammer sized dents in the bed
I just remind myself I tried hammering my bed flat a couple years ago
and what kinda profile/shape should it be
if i want one doesw it need to be well designed
i cant remeber what its called but its like a mesh to direct flow
who woulda thunk
so those 4.3mm holes i made WONT fit the screw head inside
and screws have screw heads
also single walls are a terrible idea
at least the print has good tolerance and fits perfectly
pro tip, after putting super glue on your print DONT full hand grab it
i think so, my mum volunteered there for a while not sure if its mandatory though
none of them will be soldiers, most of them will have desk jobs and a few will be mechanics
quite a few of my friends will end up doing mandatory service for just under 3 years and a few will volunteer for a couple too (in Israel)
They're not pretty but much nicer in nachos than the store bought

im at the point where if im going to make my own duct i know to just wildly over spec the fan for what it SHOULD be because i know my duct is gonna be the equivalent of usain bolt shooting his kneecaps before a race
kinda
lucky
not a bad area either, theyre just cheap here apparently
my neighbourhood is full of them, after the first lockdown they were piling up everywhere
cheers
can sarcastically cursed stuff go here
Parts should start rolling in on Wednesday and my hotend setup is a little more complex but should also be ready by then
Idm either way
Also if you're UK I'll send a filament sample once my build is finished
Once my parts arrive you wanna arrange, for each step I complete you gotta do one too
pro tip: live in a separate country so when you tire of the BS you can hang up on zoom and say the wifi is lagging
also while ium here, to cut a m5 threaded rod do i just toss it in a drill and get a cuting/grinding disk
all i need to know is what type of cutter bit
this is a very small bearing, the demo does use a angle grinder but the guy reccomends a dremel, also i got my ''dremel'' on clearance from aldi for 11.99
i had to use a cylindrical Dremel bit and angle it inwards, no wheels. at this point i think a dremel is the best tool but i dont know anything about the cutter types
the red is how it comes from factory, i need to remove that material
this explains pretty well what i gotta do
also
did you see the profile i gotta grind, how would i position it to get that
the james webb thingy
oh duh
whats jwst
Oh also if I had to use something other than a Dremel what would the best option be
but the new ones gotta be pretty unbreakable
(thankfully away from me)
im looking for a new bit since the old one shattered
see the profile, its a inward profile so no knifesharpening techniques
and thats the profile i hope to acheive
it worked pretty well
originally i used a bolt to hold the center in place and used the spinning bit to also spin the bearing
Once I'm back at my PC I'll send a video of the design
I tried but it doesn't work too well
<@360421783863820298> <@131888315866677248>  I'm gonna be attempting a filament extruder and will be using the bearings to cut  plastic bottles. I need to sharpen the edge. I attempted it on a small bearing from a vslot wheel and a grinding cylinder thingi (pink coloured rock) and it worked pretty well but it's all been worn out. The bearing will be fine since I'll wash and relube it
preferably something cylindrical
if i wanted to grind down 
put it in water
well, considering 7 of my friends had it at once and they all follow the covid rules its just luck
has anyone had much luck making a filamewnt extruder
Ah I see, so for now your stuck with having to taste it from the end of that black tube
Where's the hole for taste testing
That's for acid right
where is it?

a tree diagram thingy, right?
ah dont worry, thank you for explaining
thanks all, i think i get it now
im very lost, could someone explain this
cool, well thank you all for the help
and do the thicco belts add weight or inertia to the toolhead
oh alright, ~1kg
it looks like a beefier 1515
vs
MakerBeamXL (15x15mm)
the extrusions look like 1515 but beefed up
15x15 but beefy
crap my bad, closer to 1.3kg
yeah im doing very rough estimates
for this guys printer
not for k2
oh so weight is probs closer to 2kgs
true, is the k2 using a alu extrusion
but , could it go fast if i were smart enough to do that. assuming the motor has enough torque to toss around ~800g of toolhead
<@!784092758187966524>  all this ^
ah
welp this above my paygrade so ill leave it at. no, its dumb to attempt
ive got a 400v cap, is that enough
nice, im talking to his friend and it got brought up
is this his project
purely hypothetical so i can confidently call someone stupid
yes
a smaller nema17 will just short when fed 220v right
yeah im here to prove a point mainly
like 220v
but would a really high voltage fix that
and would a nema 72 on stupid high apms and voltage be really fast or worthless
when would it become pointless
regardless of stepper temps or cables or safety
hey <@!192355339721506816>  out of morbid curiousity, in terms of voltage around when is the point of diminishing returns
How's it meant to go brrr if you don't let it recharge and rest

yeah his new video is about sanjay
have you considered buying a jewish space laser
hahahahahaha
from steal cry print
Comments have been disabled because they were especially toxic, but I will address the underlying objection here. That being it's "too soon" and I am twisting this tragedy into an anti-Prusa rant. 

The fact is that 99.9% of us didn't know Sanjay. He was a public figure and a force for good, but the human interaction which would lead to a healthy emotional attachment is missing. For us it's not too soon. For those at E3D this is not the case. That being said, E3D are going to be back at work on Monday wondering how to do things without him. You expect that corporation to just grieve and not do any work for how long. 2 weeks? A month? 6 months? How long would I have needed to wait to talk about this for you to not leave this comment? Now, I didn't mention that other company by name because this is not about them/him. It's about E3D not succumbing to that power in the wake of the loss of their spokesman and cofounder. I want to encourage them to turn the loss into a growth opportunity for their company and not wander aimlessly so that a strong man can take advantage of them further.
ahh i see, just asked and my brother used to get from boots but now he does the Xtrme Xtra strength stuff you get
cause we used to wlak up to boots pharmacy for mt brothers meds
are you guys all in america?
Same flooring lol
True but flow might be better
Might make for a good door handle, anything that will be submerged, cases for retainers
Food safe or just for equipment?
That's pretty cool
Net price is
49.76‚Ç¨ $57.90 USD 527.73 SEK without motor.
60.08‚Ç¨ $69.90 USD 637.10 SEK with motor.
loooool they trying to humble brag
Would a wood lathe work? And how do I measure runout and thank you for the tip with keeping less drill bit exposed
I'll be back tomorrow with more news and incompetence
Cool
Or wood glued around a nut attached tj the nozzle
Vise and a nut around the nozzle?
Robodrill is a smidge out of budget
Is that built or bought
Also saw a user from vzbot built a splitter for a volcano and thought that was cool
Also I'd love to be able to tell people it's doable for the average dunce if you can find x
But I had a few of my own ideas
Kinda
Not the opening. I'm going sideways
And for soldering it together if it's anything special. Otherwise imma just slap some solder at it and a heater and see how it goes
Yup
I've already decided on a center drill of .7mm or .6mm then using a 0.6mm or bigger drill bit to finish the hole
I'll be drilling through brass
I need to drill a teeny weeny hole and my options are hand drill, drill press or ask a jeweler for help
Hey if anyone's got some tips for drilling holes under .8mm in diameter @me with some tips please
but screwing in the nozzle dowsnt end with the exact same position on every hotend so the filament wouldnt line up
for flow apparently and to make prusa users be locked into the prusament
my guys been sobbing over josef prusa being like stalin and now he wants them to become proprietary filament makers
just look at title and thumbnail
dont click the video please
i got into printing because of joel so im happy for him to stay the samw
all valid points, we just arent the target audience
my little brother loved it
again, that made for a great video, if you arent a hobbyist
and he does it very well
joel toes the line between media for the masses and media for the hobbyist
the pattern is horrid imo
ah cool, whats a better place to get a good desk pad
how come?
ive got a 5 pound voucher and i cant decide which items to buy, all of these are in my budget, someone choose
also the thomas snippet is funny. its a enjoyable video. idont mean to criticise him
i arely get pissed at anything much but this guy is too much
me?
and heres from the new thomas sanladerer video. lookign at that is like seeing someone get kicked in the balls, it hurts to see
'probably dont want to support this video'
'i would mention my patreon supporters but they probably dont want to be listed'
here that just slacken the belts boys
'tension in the belts causes ringing'
what an idiot
'yeah'
' am i going to buy this printer'
still in time
'hes more like vladimir putin'
in that one topic sure, but you can have a degree and be homless. being smart and being succesful arent the same
hes saying if youve got a college degree you're better than josef prusa. but im the schmuck at my computer and josef prusa is the schmuck with a  company  worth more than 20 million
oh my bad, thats pretty big
he thinks prusa has millions of dallars, i dont think they do but i may be wrong. that number seems a little inflated. like copy print crys ego
he blames prusa for all the hate he receives then claims that 3dpn is a sockpuppet for prusa and makes propaganda
just watch that one clip
teehee
'ive never been to europe'
'soviet union'
'marketing and propaganda are the same thing to them'
how did we get to literal gang wars when a minuter ago we were on toolchangers
'gang land warfare'
talks about josef getting into forbes, a second later 'he from czech republic'
god damn
'you're [prusa] a massive company'
as if they arent the reason tens if not hundreds of schools have cheap, functional print farms
'prusa is poison to all other companys'
he complained that joel and makers muse were arses. i dont beleive either of them are a-holes
my guys thicker than molasses
and now hes saying they ripped off e3d with toolchanging
probably, he started by complaining about the 3dpn nerd
dont worry the link sets it to the correct time so you can see exactly where his dumb
watch from here for the most awkward forced laugh you will ever have to endure
fml
thats a direct quote
he just said 'reliability of kickstarter'
`'`
oopsie
tesla can do 100 bucks because they are HUGE prusa needs a bit more moolah
he saids the bellows was a draft shiled not a enclosure, yippeeee
HE SAID SOMETHING INTELLIGENT
nooooo dont be silly, the release of the print farm and prusa xl is just coincidental<:agony:672200212252590089> . they just happened at the same time cause why not
as if businesses dont want the fastest possible repairs, as if i even want to spend all that time mounting and swapping hardware on my workhorse printer
says using quick switch electrnoics is dumb cause that means they expect the electrnics to break
hes complaining about the 200 dollar preorder and how its removing kickstarter from the loop
to name a  few: the e3d revo, octoprint, the lgx
nah just says prusa is stealing every single damn innovation in printing
then says its useless, as if fw wouldnt try to lower nozzle temp by a set delta or increase fan speed
says thermistors for heat creep detection is overkill but load cells for jam detection isnt
jeez mans huffed a little too much abs fumes
then talks about the 'common drive gear' being a lie by ommision cause bondtech is their competitor as if that isnt a massively cloned style of gear
and saying wow this better thing is great then turning around and saying wow look at these loosers using this nice newthing is dumb
not even the same style gear
dogs
whats wrong with it?
quick swap apparently
no udeful chsnge
just a flex for the point of flexing
ah cool
WHATS THE DIFFERENCE
cheers
hey doesnt someone know if anodized alum is more or less thermally conductive than plain alum
same i really licked it
nooo so long logo
coming to the vzbot server <:soontm:745268745269805097>
got it
cool, otherwise the ones i sent ive got green light for
so thats a no on <:k3now:856626059336089631>
cheers
would someone mind sending the oof emoji, i dont have nitro
<:thonk:643938447303639050>
<:soontm:745268745269805097>
i gotta send them to save them, sorry for any spam
<:doubt:710220943674441770>
you ask, i deliver
the question applies to any mod, i just@ the first orange i saw
for the vzbot server
awsome, could i 'magpie' (steal) some emojis from the server
<@!204642074732134400>  are you a moderator here?
is it very rigid tho, sorry im very particular about clothes
whats the print like on it, is it very flexible or do you notice it cause its quite rigid
is it very soft?
hows the annex hoodie
what a guy
hey mods can you kick <@!579620337692442637>  he doxxed me
you get the point, stupid council sucks
FUCK
nearly doxxed myself
and its a sideroad of a sideroad
its understandable, the road is weird af, one section is 5m long before it changes road name
just not my fucking road
they did in my area
its cause my neighbourhood got blitzed and they rebuilt it with copper cable iirc and havent updated my road specifically, every other road has been
we have our own modem and pay 80 a month and get shite speeds
im moving house
we pay 80 for less than half those speeds
bruh, WHAT THE FUCK
whats it cost, ballpark
everyone i know in my area gets sub 10, im lucky enough to be getting low 50's and you guys get 200+
sigh
I've just got insider knowledge, more is shared amongst the private channels than public
but og design of the ultralight carriage utilises a cf berd air
the rscs is all i think
Out of context that doesn't sound great
Ahh, maybe internal geometry makes SLS more viable
What's imd
But leave it at that
I'll say it's GOOD
There's a similar extruder you can buy, I'll link it if I find it but it has 2 18mm BMG gears iirc
any noise cancelation or dampening
techinically yes
Perhaps you should fully investigate something before bashing it
mine buzzes on shutdown and chirps whena print finishes
i have one setup
yep
dang it, i much preffered fluidd for smalll screens and mainsail on pc
did they postpone development?
ok now the lightning has gone too fwar
when your $5 hotend works better than your presumably 100k+ house
true
Does it actually work
got one in america before going to visit an incredibly elderly family and had to get one at school if i wanted to stay in person
eh wasnt up to me
the uk only just started under 18 injection
ive had one of moderna and one phizer, one from school and the other while on holiday
yup
and while each has their merits all the cons far outweigh the pros
sure, im just saying theres no perfect solution or punishment
otherwise students miss school provided transport and end up stranded
and since my school brings in people from up to 2hr away they cant give after school detentions
they way theyre doing it isnt helping
my brother got suspended and he didnt give a damn, got 5 days to hang out at home and play basketball
my schools giving 5 day suspension no access to online learning, wich only benefits the people who steal
we can all see whats wrong but not many of us have a solution that works and isnt immoral. and thats that
bhut it is what it is and theres not much you can do about it
oh sure but some tik tok trends that cause monetary damage are stupid
all cause a ton of people stole parts of the sinks and bathroom
my school toilets are closed most of the day and only open if you have a teacher outside waitng for you, and the door into the toilet is removed (still stall doors tho)
thank god my pandemic hair was just really thick and looked mostly similar to my usual hair, just a little curly
i hate my DT department
'hellO goDiSVERyDeAd, wE HeAr YOu caN 3D pRInTeR. will YOu SliCer OUr PrinTER and maKe it WOrk AgAIn. yOUR buDgEt IS $0 and We wONt SuPPLY you TOols, ALSo wE cAnt lET yOU bring THe Printer home. anyWAys we EXPeCT it fIxed sooN, thANKS'
and the 20+kg of filament have gotten melty or dusty beyond salvage
and the side panels have warped from heat
where its been neglected for years
where people bump into it
underneath a notoriously leaky sawdust collector
my schools ultimaker 3 sits in the woodworking shop
yeah its a pretty good deal, i saw a similar one for 5 bucks but it wasnt for the UK
ah
wait no its also water based
oh huh, would a non slice boron nitride epoxy work
its a thermal epoxy isnt it
not sure, they let any old person in but it is mostly business so im not 100%
i can go to tct 3sixty and help with a booth if we have enough UK peeps
well just take and ender 7 remove some structural support at the front and you get a v0 on roids
why spend less when you could spend more
Leave pressure advance alone til your main filament arrives
Also check out input shaping
Fair enough, a lot transfers but cooling definitely doesn't, you'll be tempted to use 50 percent cooling fr overhangs but from experience 18 percent was my sweet spot
Trust me, once you try abs you won't want to go back. You can get good strength at high temp or drop the temp for some nice matte surfaces
Oh?
Which is why I'm confused
They haven't changed since months ago and it didn't rack then
It's squeaky
Istg if it's a bad bearing
Or maybe it's not, when I move the gantry by hand tho the toolhead moves diagonally
Is this going to require re running the belts?
How can it spontaneously rack
Aw wtf my printer is racking, it was fine a week ago üò≠
It's around 30mm cubed/s
300mm/s should be easy for the Goliath and hextrudort
Maybe the walls are too slow?
Wtff infill is nice and the walls are crummy
I think it's over extruded or too cold, separate issue tho
Okay it's decent with a 0.375mm offset
Ah sorry man, I don't want to run the print again and scrape it
It was like .2mm away
<@592032818364809217> can you help me figure out why it printed so low
Oy that's old, I'm using a cable now
It's on the wrong side of the metal bracket, so I moved it so it's on the right side and there's no gap in the duct, now the beacon might've moved
See where the CPAP tube goes onto the printed piece
Lemme get a pic
Wait but surely contact would fix it
What steps need repeating?
üòÄ
It probably fucked up everything
So I moved it so there wasn't a gap
The duct was mounted wrong, like one part was on the wrong side of a bracket
I gotta stop doing work late at night
OH SHIT I REMOUNTED IT OML
No
Why'd it do that üò≠
<@592032818364809217>
could i get a hand interpreting these input shaper graphs
thats crazy tho
so ig it was rounded
0.09999999999977693
in the variables file its this
Is this not correct?
https://github.com/YanceyA/BeaconPrinterTools/blob/main/Tools/Thermal_Expansion_Compensation/Thermal_expansion_compensation.md
This one
The fact that it's such a round number when the docs showed a very not round number makes me worry I did it wrong
Ty
<@592032818364809217> I got an expansion coefficient of 0.100000 that seems a bit suspect no?
me any minute now if ive done this wrong
Perfect
Latency 2
Overshoot:    29.375 um
Hooray
then follow the github?
i havent tested ut yet
not with a certain temp, but i just want to check contact is working at all
im lost
oh huh i thought it would output a value to tell me if it was consistent?
then im good
so check beacon poke at 180 and if its consistent move on to that github guide
alright
agh that looks like a pain
BEACON_POKE TOP=4 BOTTOM=-0.3
i should run this a couple times and if the result is consistent then im good to go (ill keep a hand on the power)
what about printing at different temps? tune for 220 and 260 and then it should be fine +- 10c
so rather probe cooler and just tune it?
textured pei flexi plate, and thats assuming my bed is perfect
sweet, this means i wont ened to baby step ever? assuming i print at 220c

hows the start macro for contact?
I have a textured pei plate so I was thinking of using true zero
Are abs and pla low ooze?
Contact time üéâ
Also while installing beacon I noticed a big gap in one of my ducts which might explain why everything has been undercooled ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I checked with the beacon and they're all around 15 ü•∫
Also do you remember the axis noise values I had with the cartographer
Cool, okay, I'm home alone rn and the printer is too unwieldy for me to move, I'll run input shaper tonight then
If I run input shaper while the printer is on my bed will it affect the results? Usually the printer sits on a wood desk
Now to get contact working and have perfect lovely first layers ‚ù§Ô∏è
First beacon mesh, the old cartographer had random bumps along every axis on repeating intervals so I thought it could be an issue with my rails, beacon says otherwise üòÇ
didnt click onto that page tho ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
i read it the first time and went, "nah i dont need their email or discord server"
oh ffs yeah its right there
i mustve missed it, my bad
sweet, and where can i find the guide for using tap
<@204565716060471296> should i remove this section?
had a friend set it up and they set the pwd
yup yup
maybe
oh nvm i think i got it
damn
forgot my ssh pwd
i can use contact and the adxl and have a quality scanner
yipeee
finally got a beacon
sweet
do i need low profile, do you know?
which beacon model mounts on the vzbot?
the what fluid üò≠
I should redo it
Can I use continuity check here?
Wispy filament I think
Any visibly broken on here?
Changed thermistor and had some weird extrusion issues. Now I'm having a MCU disconnect error
or wait for a new one tmrw
do i try thread it?
i have a spare cartridge thermistor and need a m3 threaded thermistor
<:thinksmart:665708349035249705>
scale it up
ah yeah yup
No gcode CMD?
But it didn't work
I tried the usual  SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=driver SPEED=100
How do I manually enable a hotend fan that turns on when the hotend is a certain temp
oh wait it did, but the print doesnt look different ‚ÅâÔ∏è
There's a bit of inconsistent stacking
My infill (rectilinear) looks under extruded but the walls look decent
not sure why - is gcode unsupported by tuning towers?
TUNING_TOWER COMMAND='m221 ' PARAMETER=s START=110 FACTOR=-0.35
dang it didnt work
would this do a tower that goes from 110% down by 0.35% per mm
TUNING_TOWER COMMAND='m221 s' PARAMETER=ADVANCE START=110 FACTOR=-0.35
would it be silly to do a flow % tuning tower command with klipper to tune flow?
300w ptc and a air pump to push air through the tube
yeah i was thinking find a large diameter ptfe and coil it  and use the belay to keep it moving
or do i use some tubing and heat a small section to dry filament
its a ikea cupboard
do i insulate it and make it a filament drier
i have a cupboard directly above my printer
if i make it long enough it wont matter/
hm
ohh youre right
but i could do a completely different design with a spiralled filament path inside a drum and heated air that would sit in a separate unit
the length would be ~30cm
im thinking of making a pcb heater/ silicone heater in a box and using fans to blow air out and into a 4mm bowden that the filament goes through
is a inline filament dryer innefective or is it something worth persuing?
duh ü§¶
and the ambient is around 23
whats up with the bed and hotend being so far apart in temp, its been idle for hours now
Yeah it's a PLA üòÆ‚Äçüí®
Yeah üòÄ
From uzy filament
2mm
What the actual fuck
The 2mm piece made it into the hotend and got stuck, the gears ground away the next 2mm section and squished it to be too large to come out
Have to fully disassemble
It got stuck inside the extruder
Hotend
It's really stuck
Nor push
I can't pull it by hand
I can get it out with the extruder
What do you do
Hote d
If you have some filament really really stuck inside your hotel d
is .5mm more resonable or still high
all good
nah i am
actually <@592032818364809217>  idk if i ever setup firmware retracts
its a wip, what else do you spot thats wrong
0
Same thing
so maybe because it has a lower layer time than other sections it wasnt cooled enough - so i should turn on my sheet cooling
<@592032818364809217>  think the fan is too fast? can you overcool plastic?
the tall part on the right, the red section - 100%
235c
What causes this artifacting on PLA, no pressure advanced on
Too hot?
super slicer people, whats your overhang related settings?
time for me to buy a new screwdriver, my old kit was 
Ah yeah I've done that
Is trad way just loosen the pulleys and activate
Can I use this to verify I'm synced?
What's the traditional way?
https://github.com/DupiDachs/motorSync/tree/main
This is pretty sweet
Now to hunt for references to the probe
I also can't figure out how to fully remove references to the probe, its no longer in my cfg but it won't work without it still
Gaaah
ive only got one usb to the tool head and dont wanna run a second üò≠
my crampon finally arrived <@592032818364809217> , i got the printed parts done and soldered a cable onto the board. everythings ready to be installed except i cant have the carto and crampon on at the same time. does IS need to home z too?
i can try drying again
Looks over extruded right?
250mm/s 10k Accel ABS
in the morning ill reprint in black
ac my black is dry
ill try drying
250mm/s 20k mm/s^2
overall terrible
left, no PA. right badly tuned PA
fair enough
what makes you say that
should i limit then to the range it lies in?
makes sense
same decision tho? results being junk and a better prove will have diff results?
i thought if it doesnt impact print quality it wont impact IS but thats really dumb
i forgot the other  were run when the printer was on my bed
wont be using then üëç
and while im at it, opinions on this 
ill print the proper stuff
what do you think about this mount
actual price the provok is cheaper. but incl shipping crampon is less, idk if theres a mount for the vzbot tho
it was that or west3d
i googled all the stores that had and ruled out the names i knew
duh ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
so which store is Pape?
fabreeko?
how do i do what you suggested
just visited üíÄ
just found out provok3d is in america
its got a connector on it so ill just cut the end off a spare usbc cable and put a plug on it to connect to the one at the toolhead?
i could, but i already have some usb lines at the hotend for the clone, might as well keep it convenient
does usb c work with 2 data lines and 2 power lines?
whats that small one that goes on the hotend and does usb
damn
cartographer really getting shit on
thats when theyre on
Axes noise for xy-axis accelerometer: 17538.698987 (x), 17954.955175 (y), 2904.147534 (z
wtf  it was 400 earlier üò≠
Axes noise for xy-axis accelerometer: 750.892438 (x), 25345.431953 (y), 5999.537167 (z)
and crazy good or bad
so that i know for the future, crazy how?
at some point ill buy a nozzle one, ive got a usb going to the hotend i could use for it
should i re run with a specific number?
afaik default (shake&tune used)
[sadCowboy](
yeah ik ik
bad?
hows it looking
ty, i made it to 154hz on both, reccomanded is 150-190hz am i far enough into the range. its hard to turn the tightening nuts any further by hand
Tried physics toolbox for the tone detector but it samples too quickly to read
I got recommended ntuner but it rarely displays a frequency
Also, came to ask. When tuning belt tension how do y'all measure the Hz of the belt when plucked
Oh right duh if it continues printing
Bit of a bandaid fix
Use the non essential MCU module thingy?
But I suspect it's my belt tension being super low
I'm re running it since I forgot to tighten some screws
Well yes but the rest of the graph is rubbish anyways
lis2dw btw but its all ive got rn
what do i do
so these are clearly dreadful
with klipain and the li2sdw accelerometer, do i need to manually rename every instance of adxl345 to li2sdw
"Section 'gcode_shell_command delete_old_raw_data' is not a valid config section "
i started installing klippain and realised i only want shake&tune so started un installing and it did a terrible job of restoring everything. fixed a couple missing cfg's and now ive got this error which i dont now how to fix
i forgot about that
oh true
or to have it update the estimate on all GCODE i upload to a PI
is there a way to use klipper estimator in superslicer time estimates
235c PLA, 0.6mm hardened steel cht knockoff
i havent got any real details, but its a goliath and cnc vzhextrudort
no updates, nada
nothing changed since yesterday and it was working yesterday
ughhhh
not sure, the printer is having issues connecting rn
it underextrudes realy badly
what steps should i take to figure ot why
my vzbot is finally working but it seems to print pretty badly over 150mm/s
Import a 3mf
Starting to think it's a filament issue, PA set to 0 halfway up
I changed the z offset with baby steps?
I don't think I've changed anything since the last time I tried it
When j try do a bed mesh calibration I get a move out of range
yeah cooling was def not a issue, it was 48dba downstairs even with my printer room door closed
would you agree that those issues look like PA?
logo is cooler anyways so ill use it for testing üòÖ
I'll reprint, but so far I see some issues that's probably from the PA, I just copied vez's tuning and ik it's printer specific so I gotta redo that
Aw dang wrong one?
Thoughts on the annex cube?
Now it's printing üòéüòé
Hot tightened
Fixed the missing pin on the extruder
Hey <@592032818364809217> the printer works!
I'm currently broke so once I'm payed I'll be able to re run it
Not sure sorry, someone else ran that on my machine, I don't have a adxl
just added üôÇ
awesome thank you
i would do TEST_RESONANCES AXIS=X but docs say you need the adxl defined
i want to resonatge my printer at all the freq here that have peaks to see whats causing it, how can i do that without a accelerometer installed
Apparently the kit usually ships with normal nozzles but a few got cht
I did a bit of a pull but it's a knock-off cht in there so some was stuck
üíÄ
Okey and there's a lot of smoke and pla dripping
Needle nose pliers ok?
It's been a while since I've done this kinda thing
So less than a quarter
How much should 8 expect it to spin
And tighten
Then up to 300
And thats all there is too it?
Cool down while pulling filament?
Or does it not really matyer
Is that an actual problem
Alr, I'm worried about getting the plastic inside the block too hot
More filament comes out the nozzle than the gap at least
220 with pla and the plastic is completely liquid around the nozzle
Is 260c hot enough for hot tightening
My Goliath is leaking between the block and nozzle
Well that doesn't look good
so ill get back to you in 10hrs
but ive got all morning before i need to be in school
so no more printing until the morning
alr parents just went to bed
whys it under extrude and spit out big blobs
first issue tho
yet
ah yeah dont have one
before?
but i do have a long ass section
cause this isnt the final config and i dont wanna trim anything
is longer better
gotta sort that out
sooo
it under extruded and occasionally spits out a large blob of plastic
BUT
yipeee
pushed plastic
what should i google, i cant find much
oh cool

that way it automatically comes on when the cpap is at e.g 100%
and can i tie the rscs to my cpap fan via klipper and set the rscs to only turn on over x%
what would you reccomend?
yeah i do, just want everything working right and having the rscs to run at lower levels cant hurt for PLA prints
Doesn't work with 2 either ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
yeah i was just trying to get it working and kicked it up to 2

The size isn't labelled on the fan but they measure just under 12x12cm each
separate connectors, only tied together via klipper
one sec
even at 2s it didnt work
light the kick start?
it seems a shame to not be able to finely control them
you sure? cause ive seen people using them at like 50%
my large blower fans used in the rscs wont spin up below 100% they judder/click but wont spin
also would you help me with a weird issue
cool, nothing massively concerning then?
<@592032818364809217> thoughts?
if this isnt fairly easy to fix, what wifi dongle should i get
it worked on ethernet before
but it doesnt show up on my network
the lights on the dongle flash

i followed this guide to get my tl-wn725n wifi dongle working on a pi 3b mainsail OS
oh okay, i have 0 design knowledge so i have to take everyones word for it
how come?
whats reccomended
nvm
but
aw
sooo
its a vzbot
im very thanful for all his help
so i cannot complain
ik ik but he gave it to me for free
if i have the printer resonate at the frequencies those peaks occur at would it help me find whats wrong with the printer
so itll need to wait
doesnt matter too much since im currently broke as hell
i guess time to buy, do i a) replace my cartographer with a newer cartographer with adxl or b) buy dedicated adxl
i dont have a adxl üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è

erm
not sure, thing is. i had a friend build it and do the IS since i dont have a good adxl
the y is okay tho?
and what shows that theyre fucked
how do i unfuck it
agh
<@186469468745105408> why you gotta reply like that and then disappear
not good? üò≠
y is nice tho
the x looks pretty messy
hows my IS graphs?
<@162930864483729408>
How come?
Anything obviously wrong on the buck conv
True that
It tells you how far to adjust each screw after probing

This is a pretty neat feature
Okay
Or because of those pits on the surface
I just haveny got around to that yet
Is it because of how tilted the bed is
What's it meann
But
Cause yeah that's true
Because it's out of my skill level?
Why!
What's wrong?
A friend did, how come
How's this for a first bed scan, any glaring issues apart from the bed not being levelled yet
can it run on a melzi board?
ooh actually i have most of that spare
next holiday ill pickup more shifts then üòÖ
4?
how much is a tradrack rfom scratch
Any good discounts from them?
I suppose I'll have to do mjf nylon or SLS nylon from jlc
resins are higher right?
hm thats too low
whats its glass transition temp?
cool, its gotta be fairly precise since itll be holding a bulb that needs to be well focused
will it shrink?
whats the highest glass transition temp material that i could fairly easily print in a vzbot itll be for a couple one off peices
also
what coupon, i did try read back in chat but couldnt figure it out
<@458297028028399626>
worst case ill have a vzbot around feb 10th
ill deal with this in the morning
bedtime
ugh this is such a headache
alr so would 2209 non uart be better than drv
no uart
or i can try the 2209 in normal step mode
2x drv8825
or diff drivers
should i try a different board
<@592032818364809217>
huh
<@592032818364809217> all power inputs read 24v
phew
and they wouldnt cause damage
i had one driver with those pins remaining
one more note
oh dear
yeah theres a lot of ways ive probably fucked this board
and chance it wiped out the others when it received power
also, just to note. one of my drivers got warm when it received power and the driver chip had a small lump
yeah i double checked the uart mode jumper is correct, unless their docs are wrong. otherwise i dont see any other jumpers
brb
their LED does light up tho on the status thingys
cool cool
not the driver
cool so the power ports on the board
should i also probe on the driver for 5v
ah okay i thought you meant like ripple or smth
ive removed all but one driver now for testing
what do i check for?
lemme double check the jumpers
nah theyre all broken
or query
should i buzz them
okay so for testing, ive put my z steppers first
cool, all good then
hardware wise. do drivers require 12v at all
ah okay, cool
bump
are my drivers broken
jumpers are correct
the drivers are powered, status light is on
ive got "Unable to read tmc uart 'stepper_x' register IFCNT"
ugh
Also should a motor driver be getting warm while completely idle immediately after powering the printer
With a multimeter and no coloured cables
Other than guessing how can I tell which wire of a inductive probe is positive or negative
to double check my wiring, i need these two pins to be plugged into the thermistor
ugh]
i think ill leave it for the morning, but i guess that means finding another short
although some reading online says, someone else had a short on their board preventing a boot
like my cable needs replacing
is that a usb error

so ive installed linux mint on a NUC and klipper via kiuah
will it work running hadless or do i need to have a kb and screen to get it booted
but i cant see it on my network even though i set up the wifi
so im running a NUC without a screen, ive got klipper installed via kiuah and moonraker and mainsail
ezpz
10-30V
sick, thanks coffee
no downsides to having it always powered right?
24v direct to the probe then
oh sick
My other option is just to buy a XL1509 and replace the broken IC
The board does but I'd be powering it directly from the PSU, surely it's the PSU in that case that needs protection
I don't have any
Dang
Zener
Cool then I'll direct wire to 24v. Does it need a diode or anything
Hey so I fixed all my wiring, it was definitely the z probe which is my bad. On power up everything except the 12v status LED light up. I'm thinking I can just use a buck converter and directly power my probe and only connect the signal wire to the motherboard <@592032818364809217> <@286949943632068609>
If they break then it'll be ages til it's fixed, but otherwise I can switch to my backup board
I might remove all the drivers and plug it for a little longer
<@286949943632068609> I plugged it in again and I'm not sure if there's a orange boot LED, there was a small flame or if my eyes were tricking mr
ty
cool
<@286949943632068609> I've done some work on my cr10, no more short when everything is plugged in, do you think the board is okay to power on even with the toasty regulator
its so useful!!
dude i didnt know this existed
aw sick
im not using a toolhead board
yeah, their git only has pinouts and diagrams
theres a manual?
is this zener diode required for a mellow super 5
For such a common part it's hard to find any info
It's a inductive probe
I need to find a source for the pinout
Shit
It's the only part I guessed the pinot for too
I guess so
Idk why tho
It's 100 percent the z probe
Yup
Lemme test everything with it unplugged
It's my z probe
Ah fuck
When nothing is plugged into my wiring harness  they still are connected
With 3.3kohm between them
I've got two wires that shouldn't connect at all
<@592032818364809217> I found a big issue
Like probing with a multimeter
Gotcha, any way to do it otherwise
Like to check the fans aren't broken
Wdym
Like with a multimeter
Confirm
Sorry not fix
If I think it's a issue with one of my wires having the wrong polarity, how would I go about fixing it
I know üò≠
But why is my board broken üò≠
That's neat
It worked fine last time
Eh it's alright, just for a low speed bed slinger
I don't think it is tho, thinking of how I wired it before
<@592032818364809217> how can I check if it's positive switching
Oohm with fan
Back to 3.6kohm without fans
Dude idk unplugging them fixes it
Can I fix that wiring directly to the two fans without using the breakout board
So it's effectively shorted to ground via the fan ports since they're ground switched
Since some of the grounds on the breakout board are shared
Would the cr10s pro use positive switching
Does the mellow use ground switching
Ooh I think I've figured it out
You able to help rn or nah
<@286949943632068609> I'm back working on the printer
ive got a skr pro as backup
im gonna take a break and come back to it
oh dear
dont think so, should there be continuity across the fans
Idk what the problem is
Jumpers are set right
Man idk what else to do
To double check the two pins furthest from the power inputs is where the jumper goes for 24v out
Should there be continuity between the positive and negative of a fan wire
So it would be my fans that are the issue right, as soon as they're connected the resistance is 0
3.6k with no fans plugged in
I'll measure 24+ and pin 3
Sorry it's confusing me
Oh wait yeah
That's what I've been measuring the whole time, so yeah as soon as any fans are plugged in there is
Also, plugging in either fan send resistance to 0
How would I tell
How come the 12v reg died
Not that it makes a difference, but the output voltage is set to 24v
Fuckkk
One of my fan ribbons is shorted
Nah ur right
Wait
Hm
Both fans unplugged no difference
Unplugging the ribbon has no difference
I did the wiring for the fans directly, I skipped the ribbon cable
Nope hang on
Yeah that's probably gonna be it isn't it üò≠
But not the other?
I have a short across one of my fans
Hang on
To set 24v output where's the jumper go
I must have them erong
Straight to 0 ohm when installing either jumper
Okay it's the fan voltage selectors
Drop in resistance adding a jumper to select 12v out on my inductive probe
Ah yup pin 1 is mega exploded
Ah I'm looking at that pic too üòÇ
Yessir
I only ask since one corner of the chip is exploded and I didn't see a dot anywhere else so I assumed it was at pin 1
Quick question, just to be extra sure, pin 3 is on the side of the regulator facing the input power terminals
Cool
Oh that's how you read it
Yeah it is
On the 20k setting it reads 3.7
Nah, 200, 2k, 20k
It's not particularly good
In case my meter is just wrong
Should I measure across the LED
Drivers next
Now 155 ohm
All jumpers off
Cool, brb
Also, the jumper behind the usb port, should that be on
Okay so imma take out all the drivers and jumpers and see
Oh phew yeah
I did?
Bed?
Okay, otherwise what would you guess is causing it
Like in fan voltage selector
Okay imma take a wild guess and say it's probably a jumper I've set wrong?
But I think that's a 0 error
Multimeter says 0.03 on the 200K ohm settings
Between pin 3 and gnd
Pin 1 too
Yeah there is
Mines kinda charred, which ones pin 3 sorry
What kinda points should I be probing
I was about to ask would that help
Yeah
Yup
I've got no clue what would receive 12v power
All good now tho
I stripped some wire and one of the strands had fallen on it
Yeah the ground wire and 5v+ had a wire stuck across them
But no damage visible
Which was my bad
I think that was just a short
Nah
And now a 12v reg is charred
Since the wires to my raspi were very hot
That's a bigger issue
Yeah it's a 12v regulator
Ic5 is burnt
Extra fucked
Nope
Repowering on now
Shorted the 5v
Oopsie
But looks like it's okay
Yeah I was really questioning that one
But it'll work
This board won't ever be repurposed
Solder
Sooooo
And I couldn't fit 2 ferrules
True, but I don't have a spade crimper and I'd rather this over bare wires
Just cleaned off the flux
<@592032818364809217>
Ty
Alrighty, can I just daisy chain off the one already in thete
Aw wat dude you said I didn't need to
Nothing else
Hey <@592032818364809217> I've got it powered in but the status LED only lights up for drivers
Last question, what config changes do I need to have the board take inputs from that serial
Thanks man
Sick
Since I'll be switching the bed heater through a heater port (through a MOSFET) and not this screw terminal do I need to add the other power connectors
Hang on lemme get a pic
Nah using the other heater port
It'll just be a wire in parallel to the main input is that okau
Nah don't think so switching it with a MOSFET tho
Do all the separate power inputs need to be populated or can I leave them empty and just use the power
Alright everything is wired in
Got the physical connection done
All sorted üëç
Also
When I flash the board, what needs to change in the config
Any downside to that connection Vs serial
I can do it via exp1 and exp2 tho
Issue is I've also got a screen to connect
Yeah that's where I got stuck
And on the raspi where's it connect
Gotcha
Oh it's labelled screen
I'm stumped
On the super 5? The one labelled CAN?
I don't see anything labelled Rx or tx on either pinoit
And on the zero w
Which pins are Rx tx on the SBC connector
Oh okay
The ones labeled NC are they not required
Hey <@371368050802556929> I've only got 20 or so Dupont jumpers, are all the pine required on the SBC connector
Found it
Ohhh
It does ?
i could solder one together
does a micro otg adapter have anythin in it other than a cable connecting a micro - male to usb a - female
ah darn, any way to do it with the gpio or any connector other than usb then?
i dont know hwo to connect the two
but the mellow has a usb c
so it only has micro usb ports
the raspi is a zero W
trying to connect my raspi to a mellow super 5
hiya
Also any input for connecting the mellow super 5 usb c to a pi zero w with a usb micro
Alr fair
<@592032818364809217> any input
Idk tho
And black is signal
Some quick Google says browns positive
Need a positive wire and a signal
Black and brown would be?
If blues ground
Rip
Do you know?
I don't know which wires on the inductive probe are signal, ground and power
BUT
Hey <@592032818364809217> I got most everything sorted
And the inductive would be that plus the power pin
So an endstop for example would be gnd and pc6
Idk which pins tho cause it's 3 pins on the IO and two on the endstop
Jay says use IO ports for endstops
Cool üòé
Yeah fair
Looks 5V
Yeah to both
Yeah the board labels it neopixel
One sec
Sure
Yeah Im not sure which of the 3 hv probe pins correlate to the 3 probe wires
Both
Can't find anything labelled for the endstop and I can't figure out which pins go where for the inductive
I'm still stuck üò≠
Np np
Got everything else sorted
<@592032818364809217> hey would you help me out, can't figure out how to plug this 
nah i dont think so, he just does some of their docs and stuff for fun
direct wire time
cant lie imma just skip the rest of the ribbon cable
got it free from jay at team gloomy üòÖ
very confused
just confused
im not stupid
using ferrules for that
e.g wires 1,2,3 and 4 are cut off the end of the ribbon cable and put into a 4 pin jst for the x
eh too late, ive snipped one end of the ribbon cable, im soldering smaller jst plugs onto the end
ill just cut and solder
they dont fit the ribbon cable
id just prefer the cleaner ribbon cable
if i cant figure all of it out ill just directly wire the last 10 or so cables
sorry- more context, the cr10s pro uses a ribbon cable to connect to a breakout board at the x axis, that reduces clutter for everything but is a huge pain
the ribbon cable is for the cr10s pro's original board
nah
still unsure of how the ribbon cable connects tho üò≠
thats def a help
aw sick i didnt know that existed
cant find a proper pinout
this is the best ive been able to find
oh the new mb pinout?
yeah
sorry im confused?
which?
<@592032818364809217> heres everything ive found on it
Sure, one sec
Those numbers are for each of the wires on the ribbon
Sorry forgot the context, figuring out the cr10s pros pinout so I can connect a mellow super 5 to the ribbon cable
If it's positive switching then it makes no sense that the z probe is connected with the fans too
If it's ground switching then the thermistor would switch according to the fan
If those are all lines that are linked together how would the fans change speed

<@192355339721506816> I probed everything again and I'm still a little lost, can you have a look at the results
So unplug everything and double check all those pins and it should make everything make sense
I'm not going to use the filament sensor tho so it can be ignored
The remaining things to be connected are: a endstop, a inductive probe, a filament sensor, a thermistor, a hotend fan and a cooling fan
After that I can't figure out how everything goes together
I've got everything up to pin 18 connected to the super 5

Hey could someone help me figure out how to adapt my cr10s pro for a super 5 board
and complete y project quickly
i can return it after crimping the 20 or so wires
if i buy the expensive one
ive realised
thanks lbibass
ah i can afford that
how bad is that gonna be
anyways
yeah i need to get at some point for another project, struggling to find the right size connector tho icl
ah okay its a universal thing
cna?
ive got for ferrules, what do i need for spades
wait wut im looking at amazon
eh i got it for free, beats the funky silent creality board
wait thats considered cheap?
40 quid ü•π
oh mb, yeah the mellow
what crimp tool should i get to do all the crimps for a fysetc super8
could also use a continuity check to make sure all the coils are connected
sounds like the coils arent correctly connected
yike
ive bent some m3 creality ones by hand before
sometimes it reads my fully charged 18650s as 23V and thats when i know it needs a fresh battery
dawg i got a 5 dollar meter from goodwill
400 üò≠
yeah only part theres issues with is the temp sensor on the goliath, youd be best with a btt one as it has strain relief
dont know exact figures but some of it goes to vez to pay back the crazy prototyping costs etc
<@123912635526807553> bozzle coming soon soon üòé
ü§∑
ear tensifier bot does it
not as a thumbnail
how do i view that as a full res img
if youve got a pic of dale ill do it easily
hours of stale diffusiobn
FINALLY ITSUSEFUL
spare port?
ah that trap
TRAPS ü§®
idk not a specialist
more stresses as less melted?
i just like it to keep count
we do the same for vzbot
i thibk
dir
i heard glass dust, volcanic ash and decided i liked lungs
is input shaping and pressure advance enabled
doesnt usually work but sure feels great
you tried giving it a solid kick
different driver/stepper?
time to upgrade
üò©
well you're always welcome in VZbot
a teeny weeny worm sits at the nozzle and eats the ooze
next upgrade for ivan miranda, hire a beluga whale?
40 bltouches is pretty custom, i like my explanation most
what if its 40 bltouches painted clear that probe the whole bed at once
oh ic ic. could always leap to .6mm and use .8mm line width
arachne and just let it figure out the details
oh cool cool
oh did it not send?
(cause vez + blippi look pretty similar)
id rather the hotend made by blippi /s
ah i see, have it sooner for same price or for less afterwards
i get its weird, but what leg up would they get
first i saw it was dalias and slice engineering might have had one for the magnum+
ah i see, i wouldnt bother with a knockoff then
im all for saving money, but isnt vez's cheaper?
do yu know where i can fnd the docs for that command, i cant find it
ah i see
what do you do instead?
<@262357679329116163> quick question 
    {% set BED_TEMP = params.BED_TEMP|default(60)|float %}
    {% set EXTRUDER_TEMP = params.EXTRUDER_TEMP|default(200)|float %}

will this let the slicer pass a temp into my start gcode?
ah ill get around to that someday, thanks for the help
ah cool, SET_GCODE_OFFSET Z=-0.1
is there a way to save a z babystepping value to apply to all prints
ah yeh that makes some sense
is there no specific guide
tho they may be talking about a v2.4 etc with 300mm gantry size. i honestly dont know sorry
perhaps the both sides applies to both the left and right
i spose, theres 150mm between xy joint and the front idler
but
so center it
i was thinking it was 300mm total
herm
<@248633094515458048>
i think
so it wants xy joint ---> front idler = 150mm each side
but nothing in my macro would do that i dont thibk
i think its the z motor grinding/skipping
id assume the beep noise is whats wrong
something in my macro is funky
but i can home normaly, so the probe works
sorry its so shaky
brb
dinner
well
hm
yeh
i can home with g28, i can bed calibrate after, but set it to go with this print then no work
ill sit and watch its every move, maybe its doing something different between
icl
it does everything fine
it even homes z fine
WHYYYY
BUT NO PRINT?
YOU BED CALIBRATE
YOU HOME
gonna try the reference index now. annoying how the bed mesh fails but homing is fine
g28 works fine but this start macro wont
or will i need a physical endstop <@159774913631223809>
relative_reference_index:  so i choose point x as "0" and everything else is relative to it. presumably the centeris the 0 point
hm just checked, homing works fine normally, just my start macro wont work
ah how do i get that sorry?]
herm, <@412472500266467363> same issue. is there a way to specifiy where to probe the bed, i think its probing too close to the edge
ohh, so home, probe, home
huh?
but the height??
like the shape is accurate
one point should be at 0 right?
idk why its so fuckky
whats with this
hm
high accel or corner velocity
what causes more rounding
i cant find how to fix it
ive got a ''Cannot connect to Moonraker'' error
its ./kiauh/kiauh.sh
oops nvm
how do you run kiuah
feeling like a donut rn
the angled peice from thingiverse
ARe you using the duct?
I tested with and without a duct and couldn't feel a difference
<@826460928261226517> remixed it a little, made it a steeper angle, added more material to the part that bolts to the extruder plate and used some foam board for support
But most flex is from the flat plate not mount
Only mounted with 2 screws though since the mount pattern on the cr10s pro is a little different
At least my wiring is alright ish
I'll fix it with hot glue and foam board
<@826460928261226517> oopsie
or will i need to power them separately
can i connect the two grounds and connect the positive to the psu?
if i want to take 2 fans and control them off the same input
cause thats the only way id consider buying. but not at that price
oh i see, i was under the impression its plug in and we hande the rest unless youve modded the printer
is that straight up a lie? also do you know how it flashes klipper to the boards?
creality.com/products/creality-sonic-pad
thus is kinda neat
did you end up going with a clicky switch for the bed prode (i think its you who had the bltouches melt)
The camera can't even keep up
Wow
im 15 and not that dim
Ceramic capacitor?
Ah that one
Where?
hm
@prusa im right here incase you need some more tax write offs
Capped?
Yeah I didn't know you could control steppers with dc motor drivers
im not to far in yet though
and cnckitchen just did a proper tear down/ look inside the bambulab x1
smh
he goes ''last thing i could try here is different belts''
he added sand weights to the bed
never mind
the sand was cool tho i guess
instead of just input shaper
dude built a 2x2x2m frame for a ender 3
you guys seen thomas sanladerers new video
which sucks
unfortanutely, it sounds like its your job
i asked if i could take it home so i had more time to fix it. when they said i said fuck it. not my problem
they asked me to fix it
my schools ultimaker is full of sawdust
if only I were rich, id just hire you lot to dick around and make a supreme printer
I wonder if the bed were custom made you could embed a rail block and belt clips and get a near 0 offset
You guys seen Nero's vid on the kp3
Cool
Would different shaped prints change the ridgidity of the bed
missed that. looks like they ran outta bolts and just said ''feck it, no one will notice''
I'm not sure if it actually worked, but I baked my sheet between two glass sheets with a weight on top for a few hours then let it cool slowly, it seemed to help but might just be placebo
what size do you need, if your near the uk ill sell you my 220V keenovo for a few quid
Hehe ùòäùò≥ùò¢ùò¥ùò© course
And now I've decided to let the professional do the designs and me do the "ooh" and "ahh"
MB meant flat plane with square frame as mentioned above. But then you have the point of 3 points for a flat plane
Why not this with a cube frame beneath it and a standard 3 axis kinematics bed
Also cooler
welp knowing its a april fools i look like a right.....fool in that thread
NOTORIOUSLY B.I.G (and bendy)
what temp do you guys print PP at
my friend is 100% sure the leadscrews in printers are actually worm drives and refuses to google what either of those are
middle and have them branhc out all round in sets and have each components wires be in a wire wrap
its a stock creality board on the hotend output
how do you enable that or is it default
I see, based on k3 but says v0?
Would you guys mind shedding some light on why it isn't a fantastic design (I think that's what you mean)
Maze works wonders with docs
i saw it a while back and while it looks super cool and clever it felt wrong. you seem to dislike it, how come
code does work tho
f
vez said his got a little gummy
Looks pretty slick
Lies and heresy
Since he tuned em
It should be tuned to the same standard as vez's servos
like balex kenis uses in his fan dut video
a free swinging peice of card and a pen and paper would let you mark how high the card swings when the fan is on
does it need to be actual data or just for comparison
not op but looks like a rgb fan
its cause im a little dim so not the manufacturers fault
i had one explode, made a little dent in the wall
I love the show!
<@843926736462282752>  is that amity in your PFP
ü§©  i have a new lunchtime activity today
otherwise i cant see much use for it
only case its acceptable is if its for cosplay parts
yuppp
*this * is peek E3
oops mb, gotta read back on that
the carriage is heavy af and the steel plate + steel bed are heavy af
whats the best way to go about it
id like to reduce the y axis weight for my cr10s pro
my bad
not e3
though that was e5
oopsie, read that wrong
lucky man, ive got a 7mm thick alum and steel bed frame üò¢
come at me
imo paper is the best
since when they break they short
i dont think shorting one causes damage tho
can you get just the glass part to touch?
dip it in boiling water and see what it reads
sounds healthy
sheesh
better be getting good pay
mans sitting with a laser cutter and no ppe
smexy
funky music, i like it
And people wanted the hoodie so they released it without changing the phrasing
I think it's referring to how a printer brand ks named after Josef pruss
never
nope
and someone ekse is comparing all the extruders
olivier (the hevort guy) is doing that i think
There's a sweet spot for stepper where they get wuieter
Noise cancellation or high speed making them quieter
ah sorry isnt mine, i just thought it was pretty nifty and shred here
damn the mini is nimble
firstest
i heard from a mellow guy that trianglelabs isnt down but just refreshiing the store page/ listing
maybe they were half way through rebranding when office hours ended
their mainpage now shows a default template
Icl I still don't understand radio channels, but teaming up leads to me clearing a house, rounding a corner and getting shot by a trigger happy teamie who didn't hear me
Bro can nametags show for longer distances or for an actual use of the radio- people within a extended radius on the same channel can see name tags
nah <@210234841671663616> doesnt work
üòé
oh fr?
i love meeting people but i always forget their pavlov name
a page/cmd to show the last hour of players on the resurgence map would be sick

<@173827530929733632>
Is
Sure
rub some dirt on it and get back in the game
i considered something similar but ultimately the final cost for my extruder is 13 GBP and i did a part swap for the stepper motor i needed, the screen, controller and everything else i had on hand so i went for the cheaper option
can i test
i think its better
where do i update drivers
which drivers
back ports woked
i think ites cause i swapped audio port
i cant fix it
ik its shite

What do you guys think of the old gas containers
How much did you guys pay total for your vzbot kits?
the few things i want are still there thankfully
lmk if u want in cause then i'd have 3 total
and doing a groop buy means even more savings
half off
yeh so im buying some stuff in the closing sale
We can group order and save on the shipping
Take a look at noctus3d
hahah unlucky, we've had early end once and two days off

Nice, 2 day delivery too
And no worries about the delay. We're in completely different time zones
Thanks for the photo
cheers
just sent the money, would you mind sending a photo of the package just for peace of mind
sorry about the holdup with paying. my dad should be back soon
cheers
ship it to mr weinberger please

nice, ill dm you once i send it over, its 9usd or 6.53GBP
and ill send you the money via paypal once my dad gets back from work
shipping to 4994 hammock lake drive in florida
how do you want to pay?
crap, forgot about that, lemme finish up some work and send it over
thank you
do you mind if i pay you tmrw, quite late here
10 days from tmrw. thats perfect then
oh well thats great, roughly how long would it take to arrive
alright, so which parts of the address do you need to estimate shipping
Hey where'd I know you from
Usually x
Turn down the line width to .38 and align one extra top layer to your lightest axis
and perhaps some z hop
and reduce flow
try monotonic infill
No
may aswell spoil the rest
yeah sure
ill read on tmrw
only with hindsight
not really
eh
we're on page 11 and the inspector is imposter is obvious???

<@!792752630362406922>  samuelouis on do revise
no worries
Not on a joint either so doesn't bother me
It's on the back panel tho so I taped it down and it won't get ripped after removal
Nah UK
Removing a sticker voids it too
Incase we send it in for repair and have the warranty voided by some silly clause
Ah my parents wanted to do it right
Special student discount on a 12 quid cost
Yup, got an education edition for 5 quid

On Friday you'll know
That's for me to know and you to find out

oh i remember this printer, its dope. its got the arms hanging from the top
damn, and i thought that filament printed well on *my* printer
Just looked back and I thought the layer went left to right but it's top to bottom. It's even more impressive then that it's so even
the part nearest the bottom left looks injection molded
D A M N
To cancel it
Ohh he wants one that moves in the opposite direction of the acceleration
That are fast
I think it was the car company with the red cars
There was a f1 car with live adjustable suspension, can't remember exact specifics but they had it pretty well figured

That fine. Just don't upload it
But don't post anything in your channel just yet, they'll try register
Yes
I think it's time to start your requests
Thanks, you too!
I'll try, I'm out rn so i might not see it
dont tell the other admins üòâ
literally yesterday
proof of a first layer in progress is enough
cool, you're well within limit anyways, ive had some sit for a week or so
hehehehe
and ill let it pass
just start it when the time comes
there isnt
but no worries, just preemptive
i can agree, just the wording, and text
just came off a little agressive, just the wording
yeah thats a permanent mount, may aswell
just dont use locknuts ( they tend to trick you into over torqueing the bolt)
ah cool
it helps for vibrations
for loctite you want the one that holds the bolts but not glues them in
couldnt say, ive been working though a friends collection
only note is keep away from hands its very water repellent
yup, good price for tons of lube
there it is
it is used as that sometimes
thank you

That's awesome. Huge innovation in weight
thank you, so much. and dont worry which ender 5 its from. literally any will be awsome
ill obviously pay shipping
whats prp, but yeah any electrnics box and ender 5 parts that will be binned i would love to take
Are those electronic boxes still available, turns out I'm visiting america soon so j can pick them up <@!186681249652277248>

thanks
when i send the stl, i send these two right
oh cool, im just downloading them now then ill make a little announcement
assuming im on pc when it happens then sure, im happy to do that. how would i generate it and would i just forward the stl to them?
im usually on mobile so i handle most of it when i can (apart from the final command)
i forgot to include the mount, here you go
have fun!
i forgot to include the mount, my bad
happy printing!
ive just kicked them a couple times so hard the ragdoll glitches and they get stuck in walls
cool
oh so if theyre idle you can do the same kick?
usually you can send them flying
isk if people already tried it, but you can one shot every npc by running jumping and entering slo mo mid air before kicking them
Phoning an emergency fella now
Yeah unfortunately it's now raining and very flooded
Do I just wash around under the water
Is there any way I'd break it by trying
And with power washing
How would I tell?
It's under tile and concrete in our driveway üò≠
How would I find out for London area
Though hearing that I must be wrong
Probably ww2 era or 80s
But there's still some smell and gurgling noise and standing water
I tried draino and hot water
What can I do for a clogged soak away drain
Awesome, I'll draw some things up and share here
How DIY friendly are concrete water features? Is it like HV electronics where it's a hard no for beginners or is it like Arduino where almost anyone can pick it up
And I've been requested to make a concrete water feature and a wooden planter
Fake grass still unsure on
And a couple hanging plants for the wall
A planter box the width of the window
Narrowed it down to 2 large plants for the doorway
We've been to the garden centre
Yeah the planters and trees/shrubs are definitely coming
Unfortunately my parents say no, they don't want to dig up the front of the house
Ooh that sounds so nice
I live here so it's hard to make a objective decision
And opinion on the fencing
Do you think leave it stone and add the planters and everything else or add grass too
We're probably going to go with fake grass since it's low maintenance
Ah okay okay
the planter and trees tho?
thats fair - im not keen on the grass either
opinions on the original vs edit?
going to the garden center today to size up m options
ooh thats a good shout
i worry the thin flat toppers will look odd
should i bring the whole wall up higher by a layer of brick
a lot of the new stuff im seeing are wide and flat
alright best bet is knock off the old stuff and replace
if buying enw bricks is a no go do you think the wooden planter will hold up?
ill talk to my dad and see what hes up for
ah well
they do the bricks for walls
im not sure if its a thing here, looking up "reddit brick matching brickyard diy uk brick field" and looking through that gives nothing
fair, lemme do some more looking
putting brickyard into google maps would bring it up right?
theres none near me in london
fair but i cant find bricks that match the other side
also, and backyard critiques?
what wuold you reccomend having seen the whole thing
yeah sorry, in my head it was very clear but you obviously havent seen the whole yard so it was hard to describe
so drainage should be all good
and behind it is a 1m or so drop to our neighbours backyard that we drain into via gravel which is held by a wire fence on the neighbours side
the shed/summer house/annex at the bottom of the garden is raised above ground level by some feet so it wont get wet from runoff
doing a packed stone trench would be okay except it doesnt hide the topper missing
okay - original complaint is lack of wall topper on the left - my solutionw as a raised box to hide that (i havent found any similar wall topper otherwise id just put that in)
one more sec
my bad no
this is the whole yard, my dads complaint is that we have no coping (wall topper) for the left side
hang on tho
my plan for the planter is some flower bulbs and something that looks green in the winter
lemme get a photo of the whole yard
true that
one reason im more resistant to your suggestion is it sounds like it would look kinda dead/sad imo and id probably need to do the other side of the yard in the same way
is this what you imagined?
the planter box wouldnt touch the wall really which is why im more keen on it
how so?
also im not sure the wall is super stable, we had someone pour cement behind it to reinforce it tho
so itd just be a rocky patch?
ill plant some fruit or flowers
but the wood i have is untreated, i have some of this [paint](
then the box can drain
my solution would be a tarp over the inside walls that extends slightly into the dirt below (away from the inside of the box)
my dads concern is that it would rot
how about a wooden planter, ive got some spare wood that would fit
i made this in photoshop
instead of brickwork and all sorts that im not qualified for
new idea
The yard is house level, the road is much higher and the back is well below
Any suggestions for how to nicen up that corner
If my parents say no to that because it's expensive
Yessir ü´°
But still fair
Idk if changing the backyard would impact drainage
That's fair, but the front of our house is just under 1.5m below street level
Id still need to do some brickwork to get the soil to be the same level as the rest of the lawn
That'd be less effort for sure
If I try level it, I don't really mind if it'll be lumpy I just want to reduce how much of a slope there is.

Would that still be a Pita
The other side isnt broken
Oh yeah, since we're on a hill, that lowered section of the backyard with the shed is still about a meter above our neighbours ground. It's a concrete patch so most water runs off to our neighbours
I'd need to do a bit of brickwork to raise the wall up, and then maybe a wood facade to look nicer?
Does that sound reasonable?
My mum suggested digging up a lot of dirt along the wall and replacing it with some fancy stuff for growing flowers and using what weve dug up to level out the rest of the lawn
Our backyard has a section of really un level dirt with half a wall
all sanded
What do you think of it functionally and athletically for a multi-purpose wok bench
But my little bro can't measure smh
So they're meant to be flush with the surface
But it's 3
Thought the table was 5mm
Got some measurements wrong
do 2 brushed coats, sand it and then wipe on a thinned layer
im gonna use a brush for it

screwfix.com/p/ronseal-trade-polyurethane-interior-varnish-satin-clear-750ml/468vt#product_additional_details_container
I figured a clear wax could be nice
I need to decide what finish to apply
But before that, filler, sand, finish
Either way the granites gonna be a bitch to carry üò≠
Oh right, plan is to glue it up in my room
How come?
He's 17, man's built different
And during lockdown built bespoke tables and sold them
My friends done up most of his houses gas, water and electricity
Just gotta oil everything, glue down the granite and carry it upstairs
Drove it home holding it with one hand
He's got a 2k planer ü§Ø
Traded him some RC airplane parts for his time and experience
Got a pallet from a build sit, granite for 3 quid off ebay
I did it all with a friend
And you can do it too as a beginner!
Final cost: 3 gbp
Building a granite desk
Unfortunately can't really convert lux to lumens, not without a known reference
Ah okay, they could be close to 6500, I'm still pretty skeptical, but they are much less directional than LED so it could be mega diffused
but in a average bedroom that much light would give me a headache
unless his room is large enough that each light doesnt overlap
as far as im aware its something that adds, not linearly, but they do add
36k is a shittonne of light, is that a true 36k or advertised
And we spent most of the day running off solar only
Pretty cheap rn
What's special about their cycle?
I think the UK is working on small, modular reactors which sounds awesome
whats everyones annual usage?
we got solar recently and we pay around 8-23 iirc depending on the time of day
DAMN
Oh dear
its weird fixtures 
i told him if i do it, itll be new fixtures and new everything
hes got the nest app installed. not a clue what for
and they all have individual apps
its not working, its 3 or 4 different light fixtures from different crappy chinese brands
is it compatible with everything out there. my dads bought some random "smart" devices like lights and stuff and they all have individual apps and stuff
gotcha, so if im going into making a smart home cold turkey then i should invest in home assistant
what was the ...
i saw a discussion some time ago about what was best like home assistant vs ....
How come we can't send image there
Hey I'm lvl1

You can always start the download now if u want
In car still
Sorry

hey its me your old boss, send me the lathe  /s   üòÑ
pressure advance
ah im in the uk
what country are you guys in, iahve about 4kgs of sorted plastic with no contaminants
Every interview I saw of him was full of joy, life and a incredible amount of knowledge
wow this is great!
You're gonna want inpt shaper and assuming your moves are just gcode then it'll be all good
Probably not, but you can still run klipper with your setup I think
check vez's video on which steppers are best and go from there
it might need a fan taped to it
if you need a upgrade theres either wantais or e3d that are really good, just depedns on location
ah cool
any specific brand or are they no name
which stepper are you using
just make sure you habve enough torque first
like the 30 tooth 5mm inner bore
yup
so a larger pulley give you more speed, albeit less torque and resolution
np, you can also try a larger pulley diametter, since the load is so light you may not need a ton of torque
just make sure it specced right
also, you casn use a stepdown conv if you need anything to be powered by a lower voltage
nice
oh cool, you can try using a higher voltage for the one stepper
nice, may want to swap that leadscrew for belts or convert to corexy

I've spent the last two weeks in the US (two more to go) then I get home for school and then fly back here for a wedding 6 days after I get back homd
It saves a lot on shipping costs
It does make online shopping a breeze tho, I ship stuff to all my family and pick it up whenever I visit
It certainly feels like that in the summer
Ah dang, I'm a hour drive away from NYC
Oh are you in new York?
I'm on GMT +5 but I'll try make it if I can
removed some images with the same text too

Damn sexy wiring
Go on...
Wow you guys make aging sound really really appealing
I can edit the yt bot tomorrow to include a announcement ping
Ohh someone on the team asked that vezs videos didn't send a ping
Good bot
but you can do a video call
yeah he does üòÖ
Nah post exam stuff üòé
so close
and i have to wait one more month
bro my 330 has been sat in bedroom for a month
Hehehe
damn whatd he say
Honestly you're an inspiration, it's incredible how much you put into your family and this project and how much care you have for everyone üôè

Ohhh
Wait why
Oh from mellow? Are the black parts painted
whats your hours like?
thats insane
do you have a day job too?
what on earth do you print
brag away man, 175K on two printers is insane
gah damn, thats gonna be a sick build
lucky lucky man
you building a second?
my wallets taking a flogging this summer. ive got a kit on the way + all the upgrades i want ü§£
ah thats sick, ive got a 3mm plate thats pretty solid. if i can aford one ill probably buy a flex plate
is fr4 that bendy? how thick of a layer would you need?
is the goliath 60mm by any chance
i own a entire printer + goliath for that

howd he get them so quickly
those are metal braces right
That printer
Hot damn üòé
The other videos seemed misguided, here he just sounds paranoid
First video I thought he sounded a bit nutty
chowza
but one slip up
ah go on
hahaha ive been leaving some pretty sarcastic comments on their insta
man got his license revoked üíÄ
or was that someone else
was brusli the guy encouraging credit fraud
oh well
notexttospeech has a lot of vids on it
yeah
oh well, bot was scummy apparently
MUH RANK
WE REMOVED MEE6 üò¢
we should stick something in the serial area for owners, if their acc is hacked they can dm us on a new acc with proof od printer and we give them the new serial
cool
u messaged him or shall i
23 who's time?. I'll be busy for the next 3 ish hours
they still operate out of the uni incubator no?
to check
i sent a message
uh oh
yup
mate
we gotta upload to imgure if we want these permanently
ooh reminds me
üíÄ what'd he say
can we we add it?
this bot looks pretty cool
i spose tell him we dont condone it and ask he doesnt discuss it here
hm
ye hahah just read that
idk if its just some awkard dude or a really dim scammer
you @all: get mod i @all: get kicked
ahahahaha, i think i got kicked for it. shoulda made the joke without actually @ing
sorry, didnt mean to embarrass
just kinda my default chat ig
over in nitrams
<@451709396280410132> what was the @ everyone for?
we can always add it back if something breaks
dont think so
happy 20th
ayyyy congrats
yeah, the speed is cool tho
Yeah. Same I thought those were permanent
Cause we should probably upload to Imgur instead for a permanent solution
Do we want those permanently
Uh og
for what its worth my friends approve
hey Devin, since i dont have a serial yet, would it be okay if i buy one from you later with a serial number
ü§ü HAWT
i guess a kcik at least is reasonable
if someone else complains unprompted
agreed, he does great ina  couple other servers too. plus hes got the skeletonied blocks
itll probably be cheaper that way than getting from aliexpress
you + me + rest of vzbot team. weekend in china?
An airgap in a printed one would work
Dude made a fuss about iOS Vs android in annex in #gamung
kek
it got deleted with and without captions
i just tried, can you see anything there
I figured I'd just go to one of the small non chains down the road
Hm, I don't have any id, was it at a big bar?
Thanks
I've got a full metal vzbot waiting to be built after my exams this, that's my motivation
Work better be less stressful üò°
Yeah my mum missed her 50th by a couple years üòé
Thanks, got myself some presents in the mail, 16 feels much bigger than 15, tho I'm sure it feels like that at every milestone
(With a full meal and guardian)
40m til I can legally drink üòéüòé
dont think the bot could reach those exactly
i wish we could get one, unfortanutely the two places that need it most are on a 10cm step
can we add the midjourney ai bot to the server
Okay but he's older than me, it's not a very high bar to stay in the server. There's no hoops to jump through, we just ask people to be polite
yeah hes been a bit of an ass
I think ripoff cost is what they were talking about
What's up with <@832749894586073109>
They're a year or two older
Never met irl tho
Talked to them a bit
They give my age group a bad name
Useless role, no one's got it iirc
Didn't listen clearly
Tried yesterday
Agreed
Instead of clogging general
We good with having them squabble in a thread?
Ah totally different spots
I think it's so no one else can msg
Not sure actually
Is it possible to pause updates for a bit until after the initial rush slows
Maybe just owners
Ah true
We can @every1 for it
Much better than my solution
I love it
<@509772297289072653> where are you going in punta Cana I just left
R/feet will reach new heights, soon it'll be full 3d feet scans */s*
sure
we got rid of it
nvm
i think e have
Which ones you?
https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/
We should add this bot
Oh sick. You're practically famous (to 3d printer nerds)
good luck
We were the only people there

who knew
just see what everyone else says
Sure
True
I'll re jig the bot later
yeah im not even bothered about the camera, it was some cheap waterproof 720p one weve had fore 6yrs. but the photos thats what i want. im headed back to the canal on the weakend with a maget on the weekend potentially to see if i can dredge it up
yeh, not much to do now. but it wasnt internet enabled
My friend dropped his bag of clothes in too
Butterfingers + canal makes for a bad time
100k steps
I return tired and with one less camera
3 day hike
I'll be away for 3 days, cya üëã
We should make a @giveaway role for the bot to @ when a new giveaway starts
That's fine that it's new. Did we announce that anywhere yet
Above lvl2 is fair?
I don't think time matters. But we can just check their level (based on messages sent)
But manually would be easy enough
I don't know any automatic ways to do this
Hey, madbull requested that giveaways require a certain server level to win. Since the last winner joined for the giveaway and left immediately after
That's gotta be on purpose, it's not difficult to see the store isn't fysetc and just some reseller being scummy
Thanks
In our server ?
vs daily in polymnaker
nvm, this is weekly
are those giveaways the same as what happens in the polymaker discord or is it a separate giveaway

watch out, here comes the cool guys
agreed
we've had no reason to block it before
the slurs tho id like to keep
i changed it a little, just flags slurs now, and free nitro. i dont think the free nitro bit is needed tho. phishy does that
Wow the bot works great
alrighty
Shall I ask in general
Hey, you guys mind letting me get the serials today, TaylorMade wants #50
Tbf there is a website giving out free nitro rn
We should move <#834876847702409298> to vzbot instead of general. And reorder a few. I can get to that if you guys want
Sure, I'll be on holiday from thrusday so can't contribute much other than perms and that kinda stuff

how far off was mee6
nice
who clicked his link to chess
for something more suitable
i changed their nickname and roles

a couple might get printers
theyre friends
i8f theyre anyoing we can ban

and rejoined
he left
that adder dude
That's sick

Nice
So it auto mutes any repeat text sender's

slight chance, he takes a while to respond though

They were on a tight schedule, they didn't have time to land and just air dropped the cargo
You can also right click any website and click translate to English
not a ratrig, but i do have a couple
so a little cad or a little adapter would fix that
the carriage might not line up
does the vcore3 use sensorless homing or microswitches?
not vez but off the top of my head the belt holders, belt alignment  and possibly homing willl be incompatible
damn those bars look so pretty
cool, not much of a difference if you need ht and speed
what's the weight difference?
maybe the cleaner unplugged the server /s
weird
was down for me too
yeah they should refund you, i think either danny or mavrin, mavrin has some higher roles but im not sure who is who
i dont know how much simon can do but mavrin_2 has taken over fromn the F3D account. he should be able to sort it
150x150
I can't remember, are you building a 330 or 235?
AC
but overall thats not bad
do you need a bed heater? i might have one lying around
Ooh nice, in my brain those kinds things sound so easy "it's just a motor and some electric bits" but then I think of actually building it and wonder how on earth did we get silicon from rocks and how crazy difficult electronics are
Im not part of their team. Just average  Joe over there. Which group is that making the driver?
Yep, I plan on asking in annex engineering and in vzbot for career advice. They all seem pretty smart
Yeah and currently I'm at a stage where I know too little to know what I don't know. Which makes career path decisions quite difficult. Ugh
Yupp, and there's all the obvious mainstream ones, but there's a lot of niche ones. And I always wonder do I pick a fun engineering or one with guaranteed job stability. For now I'm gonna see where my hobbies take me and decide from there
And then uni for engineering something or other (maybe industrial engineer, idk yet)
Hoping to do physics math and comp sci for a levels
Thank you!
In year 11 now. So 7 months or so I think
Best I can do is a IOU for 10 years time

There's gotta be a catch, when do you take my kidneys?  Just kidding that's awesome, what size are they?
oh sick, ill keep that in mind
So what's the serial timeline looking like
Owh damn, now I'm jealous, guess I'll have to keep an eye out for another vzbot
we started the new levels for giveaways today at 4 and maze is already lvl6 so its nothing too difficult
ah sorry, forgot to explain. pretty much every message you send gains XP, once you send enough youll level up and anyone above level 2 can enter
Everyone starts at level 0
All good. There's a second level system added for giveaways
I'll have to figure out how
I suppose so
yeah do them as a batch. its much faster
then depending on what slow is, id do 2-6 at a time
risky, i maxed out for cooling at 20% with an unducted 5015 pointed at the nozzle. so it depends tbh
for abs it allows every layer to cool fully without having to use a minimum layer time which usually introduces stringing
Also, make sure to print them in one big set, superior quality and less time IME
Ah alright, i suppose you could print a shim and avoid the extra print
Nope, same scaling and settings
perhaps my calipers arent accurate. if theyre being epoxide to cf you could try wrapping a cf weave around the tube before epoxying
hm, i had both measure near 10.16. what're they being epoxied to
for part a or b?
I'm building a filament extruder and needed a way to pull the filament onto a spool, all the reasonably priced motors took forever to ship
Awesome, I hope they fit
Everything arrived in good condition? I think I forgot the tape. Also just got home to the stepper, thank you so much
heres the website
indeed, ill send you the tracking thingy in a sec
Same here, just dropped them off
minjes matthew@matthewweinberger.com
cool
phone and email address or shall i use mine
matthew weinberger
hey whats your name for the delivery
london
en4 9ey
barnet
6 ibsley way
üëç
oh i do need your address
cool, ill purchase now
is this shipping okay for you, i can drop it off before 1pm
hello
thats alright
cool, its a wee bit late for me, is it okay if i send the shipping label in the morning
thats fine, just send them over when you can and ill send back a label
ill go buy a label and send it to you, gimme a sec. do you know how big your box is and how much it weighs?
hey everything packaged, do you want to buy the shipping label and send it to me (the box is under 0.5kg and 16.5x16.5x8 cm)
All packaged, I'll ship them out tonight
And for peace of mind here's the peices I'll ship them in separate baggies
Oh cool, I'll send you a message once I've posted the box
Torque doesn't matter, it's gonna get geared down a lot, would you be willing to send it over. I can include a label inside the box so you just drop it in and send it
alright everything printed and packaged, i do have one last ask. im short one stepper motor (id doesnt need to be anything fancy) would you be willing to swap it for parts and then no payment. either way works for me
Update: I'm a little dim, I started by printing the peices one at a time, finally realised it would be faster to print them all in one plate. So assuming this doesnt fail in the last few minutes I can package everything up tomorrow
Progress is slow but only 15 left
oops
since my schools practically swimming in them ill just make a sign that says leave bottles here and then start recycling it
so im trying to reuse plastic bottles
ah sorry, instead of making stuff from filament. ill be making filament from stuff
nah, im looking at building a filament extruder and realised the bearings are already shaped to the filament. all i have to do is run the filament through it before it cools and hopefully gain some concentricity and remove any bumps/lumps
ah its alright, i just figured i'd check first just in case you had one lying around
quick update for the parts: im happy with the tolerance and quality is pretty good, so ill start cranking them out in ~30m
ill just suck it up and buy one
ah alright, i gotta get the bearing from the ender
do you happen to have the crappy ender 3 default extruder or similar
hey, i just realised i dont have a couple parts for a project, would you want to trade printed parts for a couple bits. theyre nothing big but the shipping would tsake forever
may aswell. if im gonna stay up i might as well make the most of it
cheers
honestly, no clue
and the quality is perfect üëå
ive got the peice to an id of 10.16
whats the OD of your tube
wonderful news
Alright, did a little more fiddling with scale and now the id is 9.8-10mm. trying to print again with a bit more cooling and a larger part. I'll send a photo when it finishes
pretty cool eh
ive heard the annex one is pretty good (rebreather) i know a guy in ZeroG was doing a big buy of carbon pellets. not sure if thats already finished or not
which are you looking at
my entire hotend is a microswiss+volcano variant. it cost 18 quid (fraction of full genuine)  bought the heatblock for 19p and the heatbreak for ¬£14 nozzle for ¬£3and wires and the rest make up the rest
i much prefer abs to petg, imo no reason to print petg unless you need one of its specific properties. only thing i have to reccomend is to get a really nice nozzle and heatbreak. cheap heatsink and block are fine
biggest downside is the smell and people complain about warping but small parts are perfevtly fine without an enclosure
theyre well worth it, abs is cheap and lightweight and very versatile
heres the nicest print ive seen from abs
everything's fixable here so i should have a final version ready tommorow
and my build plate has a little cut from when i dropped it so i just forgot to move the part backwards a little
it prints really fantastically, this is just my first print in a few months, so i forgot to set the seam alignment and because of how prusaslicer makes circular obects print it set the seam a mm or so to the right each layer
so i can make the hole 2% larger in tinkercad or scale whole model. which is best for you?
looks like ive got 2% shrinkage if my estimate is right
cool, well ill do a big cube, measure shrinkage and if od is irrelevant just scale the stl
whats the OD? of the whole stl
well, i can change the hole size if you need, what size should they be?
cooling and bottom layers need a little assistance otherwise if youre happy im ready crank these out
and layer adhesion is great
the surface is lovely (ill send a pic)
quick update: on part b the print is 9.3mm  on the inner tube
its gonna take a couple of days but ill let you know if the print works, then send you some dimensions for you to check. and if its all good then ill finish the batch
2 quid for filament, you pay shipping
each ptA weighs 3.4g btw
alright, well im using a .5mm nozzle so is it okay if its all walls and no infill
alright and how much infill, layer height, shells and what infill pattern
also whats the tolerance needed
cool, i can send a photo of the filaments in case you want another colour
and whats your preferred settings
can they be printed standing up?
i can do any of those
red, yellow, orange, black and purple
lemme check
cool, so its 12 prints. each print has one of each of those
cool, ill test them in a sec
thats still manageable
it was quite a while ago but it was walking distance from henleaze junior
wow, 12 minute drive from where we used to live
just out of interest, which part of bristol are you from. i used to live there
yeah if its the same part thats better
oh cool, thats a 2 hour drive, shipping should be great
which part of the uk are you in?
i wont be able to try tonight, so tomorrow by now i should have an answer
alright, send them over and ill try it out
my enclosed printer is down because i cant print abs to repair it
depends on their size

nah sorry, winners were announced ~5 minutes after they started
You, too
ah thats out my price range sorry
how much would you sell it for?
thank you!
Oh thank you, I've reached out to jof to see if I'd be able to collect today but otherwise it'll be from e3d
Haha same, the photos jay shared look awesome
How come?
Not yet, I'm picking it up on the 11th
there was the e3d internship and one other thing you reccomended
hey ed, what was that imperial college thing you mentioned
Dang, because it's a proprietary/ company secret type thing?
hiya, are the lens mount models available for download? ive got a spare pair of lenses kicking about and wanted to try my hand at designing my own holder that would interface with the quest 3
Dang, if the team has a prototype model I do have a couple 3d printers, even if they're unreliable it'll at least tide me over until the next paycheck and I can get lenses
anything to bring the cost down/ reduce waste
hey, ive bought a pair of prescription lenses for the quest 1 already, is there any way to make an adapter, send the lense to you etc
FIRSTEST
i look forward to it
nice
yup
nah xy vzbot is what matter
ah cool
and the admins will be none the wiser
just dont show your hands
the z axis, if you can hold it in place for a first layer technically thats pritning
so if you can hold the plate in your video without us seeing you can show a first layer
the audio is just snippets from songs i like, the images are what ive generated
üëç
lmk if theres any other issues
theres a serial discussion channel, you should be able to type there now
would it be cheaper for me to get new motors compatible with the non shaft supported parts (old ones are 2504) in this order vs buying independently
what gpu do you have
stable diffusion, automatic1111
hiya

Hi Matthew,

I know this might be quite a stretch, but if the timings line up I'd love to meet lando Norris over coffee. I also thought about who I'd want to shadow during the work experience and I don't want to lock myself into RP and programming so I'd also like to get a mix of other engineering types. I also wanted to ask if you know of anyone with a room to rent or have any recommendations for accommodation during the week of work experience

Kind regards Matthew

This project aimed to create a machine that turns plastic water bottles into 3D printing filament using a process called pulltrusion. Only recycled parts were used, and all 3D printed parts were fully designed by me. These strict constraints forced me to be creative in my design choices.
I successfully followed the design criteria of using only recycled parts and only using parts I designed, each component worked in isolation. However, the 3D printed gear was not concentric and the gear distance varied over one rotation, causing the gear to slip. Additionally, improperly vertically aligned parts led to filament jamming and tearing. These issues hindered the overall success of the project, but could be easily solved with the use of a few store-bought parts.
efficiency and flexibility is essential i had very few parts so using the bare minimum was important. using only recycled parts was challenging, but I learned to see everything as a potential resource. the ability to quickly change my design choices was important for making progress. my initial designs were flawed and required multiple iterations to become functional. Finding and using online information effectively was crucial; I had to quickly learn new skills like OpenSCAD, Klipper, soldering

sure, i can bring some extra wires and bits for practice too
<@430380494795046923> ^
fastest
all of them
nah record is closer to 2:13
so little stringing and such highflow
Also look at the vez3d yt. The hotend he's testing is sick
Where'd you find it
friday and thursday i cant
it depends what day tho
its well worth it

<@795263639824105502>
sorry mate, wont be back at my computer for a while, guillame has them maze might but im not sure
not trying to embarrass, but just wondering who from vzbot did you think was my dad üòÖ
the machine was never quite finished but heres some of what i put together
such a busy and fun event
everything was a blur that weekend
oh definitely, i didnt know you guys had üòÖ
that mustve been another vzbot guy, i had glasses and kinda curly black hair and an american accent (not very specific i know)
hey <@458663229678288896>  i met doug at smrrf this weekend, i went over as soon as i saw the pultrusion setup! last year i saw a couple videos from you on pultrusion and got inspired to make my own version using parts i scavenged from around my local area. at the end i had a partially functional machine using parts from a hp printer, desktop computer, hairdryer and a ender 3 motherboard. i used it to enter the Arkwright engineering scholarship and won! they give me a small grant, a internship over the summer and some other perks

anyways, i wanted to say thanks in a way as it was your youtube video that set me down this path and ultimately got me this scholarship (im the first in my school to achieve it)
this too
this is pretty cool
He should get a mod or someone to just sort the server and get all straightened out
cheers
hey <@!458663229678288896>  i got it working
cool, thatll make life easier
Made with recycled pla and recycled parts either from past projects or from the tip
In case anyone is interested, here's my recreator recycled edition
Or did you add a bevel to the nozzle to help feed plastic
<@458663229678288896>  I see, I'll try the wire. So far I haven't heated at all. Is your heatsink cone shaped up until the heater block where its just a flat wall
Or it bends and doesn't go through
The plastic strip just breaks
How
Is there some magic spells
Do I bevel the nozzle entrance
How tf do you thread it
got my build all ready
all from recycled materials
total cost 7 GBP cause i lost a cable
it runs klipper and only has one issue
cant home without the entire machine shutting off
but im working on it
itll work like thta but it should be smooth
one of them needs tuning
is coasting or pressure advance enabled
hello all
a tube with high grit sandpaper and a airpump blowing into it would probably work well to shave down filament, assuming you could get that sand paper hole to exactly 1.75mm without much variance
Hey üëã
OPTION 2
11:44
828009
91.5%

the herringbone will fix those
i will add, i see a little bit of slipping on the plain straight tooth gears
I've got it assembled run
I can make a clearer guide with photos if you need
It fits a 8mm smooth rod
Feel free to use it anywhere, if it gets anywhere honorable mentions are welcome
and for the mount i used some bearings with a 8mm hole but a nonstandard outside so i left room for a "cartridge" so you design a cylinder with a OD to fit the mount and a hole diameter of the bearing OD
might need a bit of drilling to get it to fit
the spool section prints with no top layer or infill in the middle (in prusaslicer make a modifier, make it a cylinder and center it then change those settings)
you can print the gear with no top or bottom layer and honeycomb infill if you like that look or any other exposed infill
It's late night rn so Ill only be able to send them in the morning
It's sitting a couple meters away from me
I just finished that
Would you like my files
And bearing on the end to have smoother rotation

Very ez
Acc song

Also if you're still taking suggestions I quite enjoy illuyanka, I think that would be a solid round 2 choice
The double stacked notes are great
Awesome, I'm not great at the song but it's so much fun
Hey koriwi do you think there's any benefit to tuning the accel per layer on a benchy, taking into account the changing weight?

Server management, they can delete messages, ban/kick people and restructure the server
fair enough
incase you want to reference it
heres the vzbot server tempate
you should be able to edit member perms tho, depending on how many perms you have that is
also <#947167071601582080>  can be set as a announcement channel
<@!152463356983246848>  default members have message perms in some of the wrong channels
Sure thing, can't rn but once I'm home I'll add it

ah yeah one photos all good, just for next time

hey if you want to upload multiple photos you can just hit the add photo button a couple times, we have a 100mb upload limit, if you hit that limit just make a thread, i dont think slow mode applies there

hey having some issues with site, 
alright, buying it now, if theres more drives than can fit and theyll fill the space of the PSU favor the HDDs over the PSU. and thank you so much for all the parta
The website wants a date for shipping, I'm not on a tight schedule so whens best for you
Shove as many 3.5 drives in and whatever else fits can go in, just before I buy the label, is the PSU suitable for 240V
And email the label after
Awesome, medium size flat rate
Yeah the t180 then I can get a medium size
I don't mind either, whichever you want least

what does the exclamation mark mean next to set rp level and therm vision
is there a limit on the set bunker delivery value, in a empty lobby how much can i get from one run
ah rip üíÄ
is that normal
it disables after i die
when i set my pistol to have a blimp explosion where i shoot stuff
so no way to have a setting automatically re-apply?
is there any realy good script to have or are they jus if you want you can have, also is there a way to make changes permanent, e.g i set my pistol to have really high damage but it resets every time i die
Yeah we got <@905051022848819231> for spam üòé
how do you get rid of the purple
im not sure but heres the tooltip from the webslicer
its not something i need, but it would allow more flexibility and i like their tpu infill, it looks quite cool
Cheers
how do you get the variable layer height
how do you raise a object above the bed in prusaslicer
I love using my .5 and .8mm nozzle but not much is designed around it
Yeah after moving to prusalslicer the only thing I missed from cura was the Arachne engine
slower which is weird but no gap fill is nice
normal prusaslicer
arachne version of prusaslicer vs
18650 battery mount? also is that top fill or Solid infill threshold area
Look for any settings with the word ‚Äùminumum‚Äù they might be trying a weird infill there. Otherwise does changing orientation or layer line width have an impact
But yeah I go for a defualt of 1.2x [nozzle size]
Ive tried 0.8 out of 0.5 on my cr10 and had good enough quality
Oh yeah. It's recommend for better adhesion too. Adds a little more squash to the layers
I've got my first layer set at .7mm and solid infil at the same and everything else .6
I think you can I in the advanced section
And infill ontop
Then you make a huge flat slab for a backround
It's not perfect but a dual material setup where one color is set to white and the other will be for infill

ty, idk how it got through
nah, no one brought electronics with for the hike
Finally got a chance to take mine to the countryside. 10/10 would recommend
Ah nice
that sucks
darn
they're pretty prompt for shipping in the country, not sure about international, probably sitting in customs
No problem
Ah my bad. When I get home I'll find a receipt. It should've been picked up today
cool, got the email a hour ago, ill order it now and it should get picked up tomorrow
goodnight, ill send a msg once ive got the label. royal mail says theyll pick it up tmrw which is nice
im off to bed so is it okay if i buy the label in the morning
cool, once it comes through ill buy the label
paypal is matthew@matthewweinberger.com
with standard shipping, final price is ¬£34.70
just to check, which of these would you prefer
sure do, we should sort out shipping before payment though
hello
cool
cool, is that to buy now or once the money comes in
is 27 GBP better?
if youre going to pay the same as new for a slightly damaged item i can lower the price by a bit
srue thing, lemme go find my phone
how far off are you?
If we're talking a small away off I can lower the price
Ah alright, this is all new to me
Yeah. Just looking at how it's handled it may be better to sell through eBay and let them handle vat and all that fun. Otherwise they contact you and have you pay before delivery (I think)
Are any of those percentages for VAT?
Sure, I'm in no hurry
That's the minimum price though
Looks to be fairly cheap overall
So here's some options from royal mail
I'm in the UK, lemme check
Awesome, I forgot to add country to the listing. Where are you?

just got to registering, yours should be there any second
someone else just openned a ticket, in ~1hrs time ill register both and give the other guy 49
good news
No problem
Nothing in the queue right now, start the request and as soon as 49 is through I'll get yours
I can try, I'm going to be unavailable for the most of today so hopefully no one registers a serial, I'm happy to register the printer now. I'll just have to check if we're at 48 or 49

just use prusaslicer
why
getting settings means i have to use a cmd line to slice
its greyed out
how do i access settings
but 3 shells should still be stringer
only nonstandard thing which may add to its strength is it alternates between a high infill overlap + 1 shell and low overlap + 2 shells
its skirt generation is iffy
the rendering is nice
ew
the rotatin
interesting ui
nozzle diameter u have?
im dowloading now
the slicing probably isnt anything special unless its wifi enabled
gcode is gcode

Hey any update on UK shipping <@668480147229376522>

Any update on shipping
ü§§
cool
any update <@668480147229376522>
welp, i can be patient. thanks for the update
sorry, ive got no experience with that. your guess is as good as mine
<@668480147229376522> any update on uk shipping?
I see, so if it's clearly mangled. That's awesome
Not bad, how do you do quality assurance and decide what isn't sellable
That too. Do you mind me asking. What kind of profits do you make from the b stock (just roughly)? It's a new concept for me
Awesome, once UK shipping is up I'll probably just buy from you. Cheaper than bottom of the barrel flash deals on Amazon and higher quality
Alright, just really anxious to get that discount+tpu code <@668480147229376522>
I can pay extra
Can I order/reserve my basket and have it arrive whenever you have it sorted
<@668480147229376522> do you guys not ship to the UK. I've got a cart of 3 rolls for 30 euro (what a bargain)
Oh well
Hey <@668480147229376522>  did you ever get a update on UK shipping

Hello üëã
dont tell the mods, but if your electronics mess isnt visible itll probably pass, just ziptie the hotend cables and get the vid
thanks, you too üòÉ
nah, my plan rn is to wait til after my exams next year when i have a ton of time off and hopefully more mony from a job so that i can build a full spec vzbot
i tried to upgrade the carriage and didnt tighten everything properly. some reddit dude convinced me i needed linear rails (shoulda tightened the screws) and the zerog is a voronesque corexy upgrade 
yeah i got into it fro my 13th birthday. ended up being too dumb to fix my ender 5 and found the zerog project, did a full overhaul then became mod there and then heard of vzbot and joined the discord and now im here
i dont do the design if thats what you mean, thats waaaay over my head. i just handle the discord stuff mainly
hello
